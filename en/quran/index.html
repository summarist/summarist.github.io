    <sup>1:1</sup>&#8239;In the name of God, the Most Be&shy;nef&shy;i&shy;cent, the Most Mer&shy;ci&shy;ful.
    <sup>2</sup>&#8239;Praise be to God, the Cher&shy;ish&shy;er and Sus&shy;tain&shy;er of the worlds;
    <sup>3</sup>&#8239;Most Gra&shy;cious, Most Mer&shy;ci&shy;ful;
    <sup>4</sup>&#8239;Mas&shy;ter of the Day of Judg&shy;ment.
    <sup>5</sup>&#8239;Thee do we wor&shy;ship, and Thine aid we seek.
    <sup>6</sup>&#8239;Show us the straight way,
    <sup>7</sup>&#8239;The way of those on whom Thou hast be&shy;stowed Thy Grace, those whose (portion) is not wrath, and who go not a&shy;stray.
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>2:2</sup>&#8239;This is the Book; in it is guid&shy;ance sure, with&shy;out doubt, to those who fear God;
    <sup>3</sup>&#8239;Who be&shy;lieve in the Un&shy;seen, are stead&shy;fast in pray&shy;er, and spend out of what We have pro&shy;vid&shy;ed for them;
    <sup>4</sup>&#8239;And who be&shy;lieve in the Rev&shy;e&shy;la&shy;tion sent to thee, and sent be&shy;fore thy time, and (in their hearts) have the as&shy;sur&shy;ance of the Here&shy;af&shy;ter.
    <sup>5</sup>&#8239;They are on (true) guid&shy;ance, from their Lord, and it is these who will pros&shy;per.
    <sup>6</sup>&#8239;As to those who re&shy;ject Faith, it is the same to them wheth&shy;er thou warn them or do not warn them; they will not be&shy;lieve.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:41</sup>&#8239;And be&shy;lieve in what I re&shy;veal, confirming the rev&shy;e&shy;la&shy;tion which is with you, and be not the first to re&shy;ject Faith there&shy;in, nor sell My Signs for a small price; and fear Me, and Me a&shy;lone.
    <sup>42</sup>&#8239;And cov&shy;er not Truth with false&shy;hood, nor con&shy;ceal the Truth when ye know (what it is).
    <sup>43</sup>&#8239;And be stead&shy;fast in pray&shy;er; prac&shy;tise reg&shy;u&shy;lar char&shy;i&shy;ty; and bow down your heads with those who bow down (in wor&shy;ship).
    <sup>44</sup>&#8239;Do ye en&shy;join right con&shy;duct on the peo&shy;ple, and for&shy;get (To prac&shy;tise it) yourselves, and yet ye stud&shy;y the Scrip&shy;ture? Will ye not un&shy;der&shy;stand?
    <sup>45</sup>&#8239;Nay, seek (God&#x02BC;s) help with pa&shy;tient per&shy;se&shy;ver&shy;ance and pray&shy;er: It is in&shy;deed hard, ex&shy;cept to those who bring a low&shy;ly spir&shy;it,-
    <sup>46</sup>&#8239;Who bear in mind the cer&shy;tain&shy;ty that they are to meet their Lord, and that they are to re&shy;turn to Him.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:62</sup>&#8239;Those who be&shy;lieve (in the Qur&#x02BC;an), and those who fol&shy;low the Jewish (scriptures), and the Christians and the Sabians,- any who be&shy;lieve in God and the Last Day, and work right&shy;eous&shy;ness, shall have their re&shy;ward with their Lord; on them shall be no fear, nor shall they grieve.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:67</sup>&#8239;And re&shy;mem&shy;ber Mo&shy;ses sa&shy;id to his peo&shy;ple: <q>God com&shy;mands that ye sac&shy;ri&shy;fice a heif&shy;er.</q> They sa&shy;id: <q>Makest thou a laugh&shy;ing-stock of us?</q> He sa&shy;id: <q>God save me from be&shy;ing an ig&shy;no&shy;rant (fool)!</q>
    <sup>68</sup>&#8239;They sa&shy;id: <q>Be&shy;seech on our be&shy;half Thy Lord to make plain to us what (heifer) it is!</q> He sa&shy;id; <q>He says: The heif&shy;er should be nei&shy;ther too old nor too young, but of mid&shy;dling age. Now do what ye are com&shy;manded!</q>
    <sup>69</sup>&#8239;They sa&shy;id: <q>Be&shy;seech on our be&shy;half Thy Lord to make plain to us Her colour.</q> He sa&shy;id: <q>He says: A fawn-coloured heif&shy;er, pure and rich in tone, the ad&shy;mi&shy;ra&shy;tion of be&shy;hold&shy;ers!</q>
    <sup>70</sup>&#8239;They sa&shy;id: <q>Be&shy;seech on our be&shy;half Thy Lord to make plain to us what she is: To us are all heif&shy;ers a&shy;like: We wish in&shy;deed for guid&shy;ance, if God wills.</q>
    <sup>71</sup>&#8239;He sa&shy;id: <q>He says: A heif&shy;er not trained to till the soil or wa&shy;ter the fields; sound and with&shy;out blem&shy;ish.</q> They sa&shy;id: <q>Now hast thou brought the truth.</q> Then they of&shy;fered her in sac&shy;ri&shy;fice, but not with good-will.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:79</sup>&#8239;Then woe to those who write the Book with their own hands, and then say: <q>This is from God,</q> to traf&shy;fic with it for mis&shy;er&shy;a&shy;ble price!- Woe to them for what their hands do write, and for the gain they make there&shy;by.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:83</sup>&#8239;And re&shy;mem&shy;ber We took a cov&shy;e&shy;nant from the Chil&shy;dren of Israel (to this ef&shy;fect): Wor&shy;ship none but God; treat with kind&shy;ness your par&shy;ents and kin&shy;dred, and or&shy;phans and those in need; speak fair to the peo&shy;ple;  be stead&shy;fast in pray&shy;er; and prac&shy;tise reg&shy;u&shy;lar char&shy;i&shy;ty. Then did ye turn back, ex&shy;cept a few a&shy;mong you, and ye back&shy;slide (even now).
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:111</sup>&#8239;And they say: <q>None shall en&shy;ter Par&shy;a&shy;dise un&shy;less he be a Jew or a Christian.</q> Those are their (vain) de&shy;sires. Say: <q>Pro&shy;duce your proof if ye are truth&shy;ful.</q>
    <sup>112</sup>&#8239;Nay,-whoever sub&shy;mits His whole self to God and is a do&shy;er of good,- He will get his re&shy;ward with his Lord; on such shall be no fear, nor shall they grieve.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:133</sup>&#8239;Were ye witnesses when death ap&shy;peared be&shy;fore Jacob? Be&shy;hold, he sa&shy;id to his sons: <q>What will ye wor&shy;ship af&shy;ter me?</q> They sa&shy;id: <q>We shall wor&shy;ship Thy god and the god of thy fa&shy;thers, of Abraham, Isma&#x02BC;il and Isaac,- the one (True) God: To Him we bow (in Islam).</q>
    <sup>134</sup>&#8239;That was a peo&shy;ple that hath pas&shy;sed a&shy;way. They shall reap the fruit of what they did, and ye of what ye do! Of their mer&shy;its there is no ques&shy;tion in your case!
    <sup>135</sup>&#8239;They say: <q>Be&shy;come Jews or Christians if ye would be guid&shy;ed (To sal&shy;va&shy;tion).</q> Say thou: <q>Nay! (I would ra&shy;ther) the Re&shy;li&shy;gion of Abraham the True, and he joined not gods with God.</q>
    <sup>136</sup>&#8239;Say ye: <q>We be&shy;lieve in God, and the rev&shy;e&shy;la&shy;tion giv&shy;en to us, and to Abraham, Isma&#x02BC;il, Isaac, Jacob, and the Tribes, and that giv&shy;en to Mo&shy;ses and Jesus, and that giv&shy;en to (all) proph&shy;ets from their Lord:  We make no dif&shy;fer&shy;ence be&shy;tween one and an&shy;oth&shy;er of them: And we bow to God (in Islam).</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:153</sup>&#8239;O ye who be&shy;lieve! seek help with pa&shy;tient per&shy;se&shy;ver&shy;ance and pray&shy;er; for God is with those who pa&shy;tient&shy;ly per&shy;se&shy;vere.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:172</sup>&#8239;O ye who be&shy;lieve! Eat of the good things that We have pro&shy;vid&shy;ed for you, and be grate&shy;ful to God, if it is Him ye wor&shy;ship.
    <sup>173</sup>&#8239;He hath on&shy;ly for&shy;bid&shy;den you dead meat, and blood, and the flesh of swine, and that on which any oth&shy;er name hath been in&shy;voked be&shy;sides that of God. But if one is forced by ne&shy;ces&shy;si&shy;ty, with&shy;out wil&shy;ful dis&shy;o&shy;be&shy;di&shy;ence, nor transgressing due lim&shy;its,- then is he guilt&shy;less. For God is Oft-forgiving Most Mer&shy;ci&shy;ful.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:177</sup>&#8239;It is not right&shy;eous&shy;ness that ye turn your faces To&shy;wards east or West; but it is right&shy;eous&shy;ness- to be&shy;lieve in God and the Last Day, and the An&shy;gels, and the Book, and the Mes&shy;sen&shy;gers; to spend of your sub&shy;stance, out of love for Him, for your kin, for or&shy;phans, for the needy, for the way&shy;far&shy;er, for those who ask, and for the ran&shy;som of slaves; to be stead&shy;fast in pray&shy;er, and prac&shy;tice reg&shy;u&shy;lar char&shy;i&shy;ty; to ful&shy;fil the con&shy;tracts which ye have made; and to be firm and pa&shy;tient, in pain (or suf&shy;fer&shy;ing) and ad&shy;ver&shy;si&shy;ty, and through&shy;out all pe&shy;ri&shy;ods of pan&shy;ic. Such are the peo&shy;ple of truth, the God-fearing.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:180</sup>&#8239;It is pre&shy;scribed, when death approaches any of you, if he leave any goods that he make a be&shy;quest to par&shy;ents and next of kin, ac&shy;cord&shy;ing to rea&shy;son&shy;a&shy;ble us&shy;age; this is due from the God-fearing.
    <sup>181</sup>&#8239;If any&shy;one changes the be&shy;quest af&shy;ter hear&shy;ing it, the guilt shall be on those who make the change. For God hears and knows (All things).
    <sup>182</sup>&#8239;But if any&shy;one fears par&shy;ti&shy;al&shy;i&shy;ty or wrong-doing on the part of the tes&shy;ta&shy;tor, and makes peace be&shy;tween (The parties con&shy;cerned), there is no wrong in him: For God is Oft-forgiving, Most Mer&shy;ci&shy;ful.
    <sup>183</sup>&#8239;O ye who be&shy;lieve! Fasting is pre&shy;scribed to you as it was pre&shy;scribed to those be&shy;fore you, that ye may (learn) self-restraint,-
    <sup>184</sup>&#8239;(Fasting) for a fixed num&shy;ber of days; but if any of you is ill, or on a jour&shy;ney, the pre&shy;scribed num&shy;ber (Should be made up) from days lat&shy;er. For those who can do it (With hard&shy;ship), is a ran&shy;som, the feed&shy;ing of one that is in&shy;di&shy;gent. But he that will give more, of his own free will,- it is bet&shy;ter for him. And it is bet&shy;ter for you that ye fast, if ye on&shy;ly knew.
    <sup>185</sup>&#8239;Ramadhan is the (month) in which was sent down the Qur&#x02BC;an, as a guide to man&shy;kind, al&shy;so clear (Signs) for guid&shy;ance and judg&shy;ment (Between right and wrong). So eve&shy;ry one of you who is pre&shy;sent (at his home) dur&shy;ing that month should spend it in fasting, but if any one is ill, or on a jour&shy;ney, the pre&shy;scribed pe&shy;ri&shy;od (Should be made up) by days lat&shy;er. God in&shy;tends eve&shy;ry fa&shy;cil&shy;i&shy;ty for you; He does not want to put to difficul&shy;ties. (He wants you) to com&shy;plete the pre&shy;scribed pe&shy;ri&shy;od, and to glo&shy;ri&shy;fy Him in that He has guid&shy;ed you; and per&shy;chance ye shall be grate&shy;ful.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:188</sup>&#8239;And do not eat up your prop&shy;er&shy;ty a&shy;mong yourselves for vanities, nor use it as bait for the judges, with in&shy;tent that ye may eat up wrong&shy;ful&shy;ly and know&shy;ing&shy;ly a lit&shy;tle of (other) peo&shy;ple&#x02BC;s prop&shy;er&shy;ty.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:200</sup>&#8239;So when ye have ac&shy;com&shy;plished your ho&shy;ly rites, cel&shy;e&shy;brate the praises of God, as ye used to cel&shy;e&shy;brate the praises of your fa&shy;thers,- yea, with far more Heart and soul. There are men who say:  <q>Our Lord! Give us (Thy bounties) in this world!</q> but they will have no por&shy;tion in the Here&shy;af&shy;ter.
    <sup>201</sup>&#8239;And there are men who say: <q>Our Lord! Give us good in this world and good in the Here&shy;af&shy;ter, and de&shy;fend us from the tor&shy;ment of the Fire!</q>
    <sup>202</sup>&#8239;To these will be al&shy;lot&shy;ted what they have earned; and God is quick in ac&shy;count.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:215</sup>&#8239;They ask thee what they should spend (In char&shy;i&shy;ty). Say: What&shy;ev&shy;er ye spend that is good, is for par&shy;ents and kin&shy;dred and or&shy;phans and those in want and for way&shy;far&shy;ers. And what&shy;ev&shy;er ye do that is good, - God knoweth it well.
    <sup>216</sup>&#8239;Fight&shy;ing is pre&shy;scribed for you, and ye dis&shy;like it. But it is pos&shy;si&shy;ble that ye dis&shy;like a thing which is good for you, and that ye love a thing which is bad for you. But God knoweth, and ye know not.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:219</sup>&#8239;They ask thee con&shy;cern&shy;ing wine and gambling. Say: <q>In them is great sin, and some prof&shy;it, for men; but the sin is greater than the prof&shy;it.</q> They ask thee how much they are to spend; Say: <q>What is be&shy;yond your needs.</q> Thus doth God Make clear to you His Signs: In or&shy;der that ye may con&shy;sid&shy;er-
    <sup>220</sup>&#8239;(Their bear&shy;ings) on this life and the Here&shy;af&shy;ter. They ask thee con&shy;cern&shy;ing or&shy;phans. Say: <q>The best thing to do is what is for their good; if ye mix their af&shy;fairs with yours, they are your breth&shy;ren; but God knows the man who means mis&shy;chief from the man who means good. And if God had wished, He could have put you in&shy;to difficul&shy;ties: He is in&shy;deed Ex&shy;alt&shy;ed in Pow&shy;er, Wise.</q>
    <sup>221</sup>&#8239;Do not mar&shy;ry un&shy;be&shy;liev&shy;ing wom&shy;en (idolaters), un&shy;til they be&shy;lieve: A slave wom&shy;an who be&shy;lieves is bet&shy;ter than an un&shy;be&shy;liev&shy;ing wom&shy;an, e&shy;ven though she al&shy;lures you. Nor mar&shy;ry (your girls) to un&shy;be&shy;liev&shy;ers un&shy;til they be&shy;lieve: A man slave who be&shy;lieves is bet&shy;ter than an un&shy;be&shy;liev&shy;er, e&shy;ven though he al&shy;lures you. Un&shy;be&shy;liev&shy;ers do (but) beck&shy;on you to the Fire. But God beck&shy;ons by His Grace to the Gar&shy;den (of bliss) and for&shy;give&shy;ness, and makes His Signs clear to man&shy;kind: That they may cel&shy;e&shy;brate His praise.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:224</sup>&#8239;And make not God&#x02BC;s (name) an ex&shy;cuse in your oaths a&shy;gainst do&shy;ing good, or act&shy;ing right&shy;ly, or mak&shy;ing peace be&shy;tween per&shy;sons; for God is One Who heareth and knoweth all things.
    <sup>225</sup>&#8239;God will not call you to ac&shy;count for thought&shy;less&shy;ness in your oaths, but for the in&shy;ten&shy;tion in your hearts; and He is Oft-forgiving, Most For&shy;bear&shy;ing.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:238</sup>&#8239;Guard strict&shy;ly your (habit of) pray&shy;ers, es&shy;pe&shy;cial&shy;ly the Mid&shy;dle Pray&shy;er; and stand be&shy;fore God in a de&shy;vout (frame of mind).
    <sup>239</sup>&#8239;If ye fear (an en&shy;e&shy;my), pray on foot, or rid&shy;ing, (as may be most con&shy;ven&shy;i&shy;ent), but when ye are in se&shy;cu&shy;ri&shy;ty, cel&shy;e&shy;brate God&#x02BC;s praises in the man&shy;ner He has taught you, which ye knew not (before).
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:256</sup>&#8239;Let there be no com&shy;pul&shy;sion in re&shy;li&shy;gion: Truth stands out clear from Er&shy;ror: who&shy;ev&shy;er re&shy;jects e&shy;vil and be&shy;lieves in God hath grasped the most trust&shy;wor&shy;thy hand-hold, that nev&shy;er breaks. And God heareth and knoweth all things.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:258</sup>&#8239;Hast thou not Turned thy vi&shy;sion to one who dis&shy;put&shy;ed with Abraham A&shy;bout his Lord, be&shy;cause God had grant&shy;ed him pow&shy;er? Abraham sa&shy;id: <q>My Lord is He Who Giveth life and death.</q> He sa&shy;id: <q>I give life and death</q>. Sa&shy;id Abraham: <q>But it is God that causeth the sun to rise from the east: Do thou then cause him to rise from the West.</q> Thus was he con&shy;found&shy;ed who (in ar&shy;ro&shy;gance) re&shy;jected faith. Nor doth God Give guid&shy;ance to a peo&shy;ple un&shy;just.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:261</sup>&#8239;The par&shy;a&shy;ble of those who spend their sub&shy;stance in the way of God is that of a grain of corn: it groweth sev&shy;en ears, and each ear Hath a hun&shy;dred grains. God giveth man&shy;i&shy;fold in&shy;crease to whom He pleaseth: And God careth for all and He knoweth all things.
    <sup>262</sup>&#8239;Those who spend their sub&shy;stance in the cause of God, and fol&shy;low not up their gifts with reminders of their gen&shy;er&shy;os&shy;i&shy;ty or with in&shy;ju&shy;ry,-for them their re&shy;ward is with their Lord: on them shall be no fear, nor shall they grieve.
    <sup>263</sup>&#8239;Kind words and the cov&shy;er&shy;ing of faults are bet&shy;ter than char&shy;i&shy;ty fol&shy;lowed by in&shy;ju&shy;ry. God is free of all wants, and He is Most-Forbearing.
    <sup>264</sup>&#8239;O ye who be&shy;lieve! can&shy;cel not your char&shy;i&shy;ty by reminders of your gen&shy;er&shy;os&shy;i&shy;ty or by in&shy;ju&shy;ry,- like those who spend their sub&shy;stance to be seen of men, but be&shy;lieve nei&shy;ther in God nor in the Last Day. They are in par&shy;a&shy;ble like a hard, bar&shy;ren rock, on which is a lit&shy;tle soil: on it falls heav&shy;y rain, which leaves it (Just) a bare stone. They will be a&shy;ble to do noth&shy;ing with aught they have earned. And God guideth not those who re&shy;ject faith.
    <sup>265</sup>&#8239;And the like&shy;ness of those who spend their sub&shy;stance, seek&shy;ing to please God and to strength&shy;en their souls, is as a gar&shy;den, high and fer&shy;tile: heav&shy;y rain falls on it but makes it yield a dou&shy;ble in&shy;crease of har&shy;vest, and if it re&shy;ceives not Heav&shy;y rain, light mois&shy;ture sufficeth it. God seeth well what&shy;ev&shy;er ye do.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:267</sup>&#8239;O ye who be&shy;lieve! Give of the good things which ye have (honourably) earned, and of the fruits of the earth which We have pro&shy;duced for you, and do not e&shy;ven aim at get&shy;ting any&shy;thing which is bad, in or&shy;der that out of it ye may give a&shy;way some&shy;thing, when ye yourselves would not re&shy;ceive it ex&shy;cept with closed eyes.

Let him who in&shy;curs the li&shy;a&shy;bil&shy;i&shy;ty dic&shy;tate, but let him fear His Lord God, and not di&shy;min&shy;ish aught of what he owes. If they par&shy;ty li&shy;a&shy;ble is men&shy;tal&shy;ly de&shy;fi&shy;cient, or weak, or un&shy;a&shy;ble Him&shy;self to dic&shy;tate, Let his guard&shy;i&shy;an dic&shy;tate faith&shy;ful&shy;ly, and get two witnesses, out of your own men, and if there are not two men, then a man and two wom&shy;en, such as ye choose, for witnesses, so that if one of them errs, the oth&shy;er can re&shy;mind her. The witnesses should not re&shy;fuse when they are called on (For ev&shy;i&shy;dence). Dis&shy;dain not to re&shy;duce to writ&shy;ing (your con&shy;tract) for a fu&shy;ture pe&shy;ri&shy;od, wheth&shy;er it be small or big: it is just&shy;er in the sight of God, More suit&shy;a&shy;ble as ev&shy;i&shy;dence, and more con&shy;ven&shy;i&shy;ent to pre&shy;vent doubts a&shy;mong yourselves but if it be a trans&shy;ac&shy;tion which ye car&shy;ry out on the spot a&shy;mong yourselves, there is no blame on you if ye re&shy;duce it not to writ&shy;ing. But take wit&shy;ness when&shy;ev&shy;er ye make a com&shy;mer&shy;cial con&shy;tract; and let nei&shy;ther scr&shy;ibe nor wit&shy;ness suf&shy;fer harm. If ye do (such harm), it would be wick&shy;ed&shy;ness in you. So fear God; For it is Good that teaches you. And God is well ac&shy;quaint&shy;ed with all things. If ye are on a jour&shy;ney, and can&shy;not find a scr&shy;ibe, a pledge with pos&shy;ses&shy;sion (may serve the pur&shy;pose). And if one of you de&shy;pos&shy;its a thing on trust with an&shy;oth&shy;er, let the trus&shy;tee (faithfully) dis&shy;charge his trust, and let him Fear his Lord con&shy;ceal not ev&shy;i&shy;dence; for who&shy;ev&shy;er con&shy;ceals it, - his heart is tainted with sin.

    <sup>4:58</sup>&#8239;God doth com&shy;mand you to ren&shy;der back your Trusts to those to whom they are due; And when ye judge be&shy;tween man and man, that ye judge with jus&shy;tice: Ver&shy;i&shy;ly how ex&shy;cel&shy;lent is the teach&shy;ing which He giveth you! For God is He Who heareth and seeth all things.
    <sup>59</sup>&#8239;O ye who be&shy;lieve! O&shy;bey God, and o&shy;bey the Mes&shy;sen&shy;ger, and those charged with au&shy;thor&shy;i&shy;ty a&shy;mong you. If ye dif&shy;fer in any&shy;thing a&shy;mong yourselves, re&shy;fer it to God and His Mes&shy;sen&shy;ger, if ye do be&shy;lieve in God and the Last Day: That is best, and most suit&shy;a&shy;ble for fi&shy;nal de&shy;ter&shy;mi&shy;na&shy;tion.

<p>
    <sup>4:79</sup>&#8239;What&shy;ev&shy;er good, (O man!) hap&shy;pens to thee, is from God; but what&shy;ev&shy;er e&shy;vil hap&shy;pens to thee, is from thy (own) soul. and We have sent thee as a mes&shy;sen&shy;ger to (instruct) man&shy;kind. And e&shy;nough is God for a wit&shy;ness.
    <sup>80</sup>&#8239;He who o&shy;beys the Mes&shy;sen&shy;ger, o&shy;beys God: But if any turn a&shy;way, We have not sent thee to watch o&shy;ver their (evil deeds).
</p>

<p>
    <sup>4:85</sup>&#8239;Who&shy;ev&shy;er rec&shy;om&shy;mends and helps a good cause be&shy;comes a part&shy;ner there&shy;in: And who&shy;ev&shy;er rec&shy;om&shy;mends and helps an e&shy;vil cause, shares in its bur&shy;den: And God hath pow&shy;er o&shy;ver all things.
    <sup>86</sup>&#8239;When a (courteous) greet&shy;ing is of&shy;fered you, meet it with a greet&shy;ing still more cour&shy;te&shy;ous, or (at least) of e&shy;qual cour&shy;te&shy;sy. God takes care&shy;ful ac&shy;count of all things.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>4:95</sup>&#8239;Not e&shy;qual are those be&shy;liev&shy;ers who sit (at home) and re&shy;ceive no hurt, and those who strive and fight in the cause of God with their goods and their per&shy;sons. God hath grant&shy;ed a grade higher to those who strive and fight with their goods and per&shy;sons than to those who sit (at home). Un&shy;to all (in Faith) Hath God prom&shy;ised good: But those who strive and fight Hath He dis&shy;tin&shy;guished a&shy;bove those who sit (at home) by a spe&shy;cial re&shy;ward,-
</p>

<p>
    <sup>4:100</sup>&#8239;He who for&shy;sakes his home in the cause of God, finds in the earth Man&shy;y a ref&shy;uge, wide and spa&shy;cious: Should he die as a ref&shy;u&shy;gee from home for God and His Mes&shy;sen&shy;ger, His re&shy;ward be&shy;comes due and sure with God: And God is Oft-forgiving, Most Mer&shy;ci&shy;ful.
    <sup>101</sup>&#8239;When ye trav&shy;el through the earth, there is no blame on you if ye short&shy;en your pray&shy;ers, for fear the Un&shy;be&shy;liev&shy;ers May at&shy;tack you: For the Un&shy;be&shy;liev&shy;ers are un&shy;to you o&shy;pen enemies.
    <sup>102</sup>&#8239;When thou (O Mes&shy;sen&shy;ger) art with them, and standest to lead them in pray&shy;er, Let one par&shy;ty of them stand up (in pray&shy;er) with thee, Tak&shy;ing their arms with them: When they fin&shy;ish their pros&shy;tra&shy;tions, let them Take their po&shy;si&shy;tion in the rear. And let the oth&shy;er par&shy;ty come up which hath not yet prayed - and let them pray with thee, Tak&shy;ing all pre&shy;cau&shy;tion, and bear&shy;ing arms: the Un&shy;be&shy;liev&shy;ers wish, if ye were neg&shy;li&shy;gent of your arms and your bag&shy;gage, to as&shy;sault you in a sin&shy;gle rush. But there is no blame on you if ye put a&shy;way your arms be&shy;cause of the in&shy;con&shy;ven&shy;ience of rain or be&shy;cause ye are ill; but take (every) pre&shy;cau&shy;tion for yourselves. For the Un&shy;be&shy;liev&shy;ers God hath pre&shy;pared a hu&shy;mil&shy;i&shy;at&shy;ing pun&shy;ish&shy;ment.
    <sup>103</sup>&#8239;When ye pas&shy;s (Congregational) pray&shy;ers, cel&shy;e&shy;brate God&#x02BC;s praises, stand&shy;ing, sit&shy;ting down, or ly&shy;ing down on your sides; but when ye are free from dan&shy;ger, set up Reg&shy;u&shy;lar Pray&shy;ers: For such pray&shy;ers are en&shy;joined on be&shy;liev&shy;ers at stat&shy;ed times.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>4:106</sup>&#8239;But seek the for&shy;give&shy;ness of God; for God is Oft-forgiving, Most Mer&shy;ci&shy;ful.
    <sup>107</sup>&#8239;Con&shy;tend not on be&shy;half of such as be&shy;tray their own souls; for God loveth not one giv&shy;en to per&shy;fi&shy;dy and crime:
</p>

<p>
    <sup>4:110</sup>&#8239;If any one does e&shy;vil or wrongs his own soul but af&shy;ter&shy;wards seeks God&#x02BC;s for&shy;give&shy;ness, he will find God Oft-forgiving, Most Mer&shy;ci&shy;ful.
    <sup>111</sup>&#8239;And if any one earns sin. he earns it a&shy;gainst His own soul: for God is full of knowl&shy;edge and wis&shy;dom.
    <sup>112</sup>&#8239;But if any one earns a fault or a sin and throws it on to one that is in&shy;no&shy;cent, He carries (on him&shy;self) (Both) a false&shy;hood and a fla&shy;grant sin.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>4:123</sup>&#8239;Not your de&shy;sires, nor those of the Peo&shy;ple of the Book (can pre&shy;vail): who&shy;ev&shy;er works e&shy;vil, will be re&shy;quit&shy;ed ac&shy;cord&shy;ing&shy;ly. Nor will he find, be&shy;sides God, any pro&shy;tec&shy;tor or help&shy;er.
    <sup>124</sup>&#8239;If any do deeds of right&shy;eous&shy;ness,- be they male or fe&shy;male - and have faith, they will en&shy;ter Heav&shy;en, and not the least in&shy;jus&shy;tice will be done to them.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>4:128</sup>&#8239;If a wife fears cru&shy;el&shy;ty or de&shy;ser&shy;tion on her hus&shy;band&#x02BC;s part, there is no blame on them if they ar&shy;range an am&shy;i&shy;ca&shy;ble set&shy;tle&shy;ment be&shy;tween them&shy;selves; and such set&shy;tle&shy;ment is best; e&shy;ven though men&#x02BC;s souls are swayed by greed. But if ye do good and prac&shy;tise self-restraint, God is well-acquainted with all that ye do.
    <sup>129</sup>&#8239;Ye are nev&shy;er a&shy;ble to be fair and just as be&shy;tween wom&shy;en, e&shy;ven if it is your ar&shy;dent de&shy;sire: But turn not a&shy;way (from a wom&shy;an) al&shy;to&shy;geth&shy;er, so as to leave her (as it were) hang&shy;ing (in the air). If ye come to a friend&shy;ly un&shy;der&shy;stand&shy;ing, and prac&shy;tise self-restraint, God is Oft-forgiving, Most Mer&shy;ci&shy;ful.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>4:135</sup>&#8239;O ye who be&shy;lieve! stand out firm&shy;ly for jus&shy;tice, as witnesses to God, e&shy;ven as a&shy;gainst yourselves, or your par&shy;ents, or your kin, and wheth&shy;er it be (against) rich or poor: for God can best pro&shy;tect both. Fol&shy;low not the lusts (of your hearts), lest ye swerve, and if ye dis&shy;tort (justice) or de&shy;cline to do jus&shy;tice, ver&shy;i&shy;ly God is well-acquainted with all that ye do.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>4:140</sup>&#8239;Al&shy;read&shy;y has He sent you Word in the Book, that when ye hear the signs of God held in de&shy;fi&shy;ance and rid&shy;i&shy;cule, ye are not to sit with them un&shy;less they turn to a dif&shy;fer&shy;ent theme: if ye did, ye would be like them. For God will col&shy;lect the hyp&shy;o&shy;crites and those who de&shy;fy faith - all in Hell:-
    <sup>141</sup>&#8239;(These are) the ones who wait and watch a&shy;bout you: if ye do gain a vic&shy;to&shy;ry from God, they say: <q>Were we not with you?</q> - but if the un&shy;be&shy;liev&shy;ers gain a suc&shy;cess, they say (to them): <q>Did we not gain an ad&shy;van&shy;tage o&shy;ver you, and did we not guard you from the be&shy;liev&shy;ers?</q> but God will judge be&shy;twixt you on the Day of Judg&shy;ment. And nev&shy;er will God grant to the un&shy;be&shy;liev&shy;ers a way (to tri&shy;umphs) o&shy;ver the be&shy;liev&shy;ers.
    <sup>142</sup>&#8239;The Hyp&shy;o&shy;crites - they think they are o&shy;ver-reaching God, but He will o&shy;ver-reach them: When they stand up to pray&shy;er, they stand with&shy;out ear&shy;nest&shy;ness, to be seen of men, but lit&shy;tle do they hold God in re&shy;mem&shy;brance;
    <sup>143</sup>&#8239;(They are) dis&shy;tract&shy;ed in mind e&shy;ven in the midst of it,- be&shy;ing (sincerely) for nei&shy;ther one group nor for an&shy;oth&shy;er whom God leaves straying,- nev&shy;er wilt thou find for him the way.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>4:148</sup>&#8239;God loveth not that e&shy;vil should be noised a&shy;broad in pub&shy;lic speech, ex&shy;cept where in&shy;jus&shy;tice hath been done; for God is He who heareth and knoweth all things.
    <sup>149</sup>&#8239;Wheth&shy;er ye pub&shy;lish a good deed or con&shy;ceal it or cov&shy;er e&shy;vil with par&shy;don, ver&shy;i&shy;ly God doth blot out (sins) and hath pow&shy;er (in the judg&shy;ment of val&shy;ues).

    <sup>4:163</sup>&#8239;We have sent thee in&shy;spi&shy;ra&shy;tion, as We sent it to No&shy;ah and the Mes&shy;sen&shy;gers af&shy;ter him: we sent in&shy;spi&shy;ra&shy;tion to Abraham, Isma&#x02BC;il, Isaac, Jacob and the Tribes, to Jesus, Job, Jonah, Aaron, and Solomon, and to David We gave the Psalms.
    <sup>164</sup>&#8239;Of some mes&shy;sen&shy;gers We have al&shy;read&shy;y told thee the sto&shy;ry; of oth&shy;ers We have not;- and to Mo&shy;ses God spoke di&shy;rect;-

<p>
    <sup>5:1</sup>&#8239;O ye who be&shy;lieve! ful&shy;fil (all) ob&shy;li&shy;ga&shy;tions. Law&shy;ful un&shy;to you (for food) are all four-footed an&shy;i&shy;mals, with the ex&shy;cep&shy;tions named: But an&shy;i&shy;mals of the chase are for&shy;bid&shy;den while ye are in the sa&shy;cred pre&shy;cincts or in pil&shy;grim garb: for God doth com&shy;mand ac&shy;cord&shy;ing to His will and plan.
    <sup>2</sup>&#8239;O ye who be&shy;lieve! Vi&shy;o&shy;late not the sanc&shy;ti&shy;ty of the sym&shy;bols of God, nor of the sa&shy;cred month, nor of the an&shy;i&shy;mals brought for sac&shy;ri&shy;fice, nor the gar&shy;lands that mark out such an&shy;i&shy;mals, nor the peo&shy;ple resorting to the sa&shy;cred house, seek&shy;ing of the boun&shy;ty and good pleas&shy;ure of their Lord. But when ye are clear of the sa&shy;cred pre&shy;cincts and of pil&shy;grim garb, ye may hunt and let not the ha&shy;tred of some peo&shy;ple in (once) shutting you out of the Sa&shy;cred Mosque lead you to trans&shy;gres&shy;sion (and hos&shy;til&shy;i&shy;ty on your part). Help ye one an&shy;oth&shy;er in right&shy;eous&shy;ness and pi&shy;e&shy;ty, but help ye not one an&shy;oth&shy;er in sin and ran&shy;cour: fear God: for God is strict in pun&shy;ish&shy;ment.
    <sup>3</sup>&#8239;For&shy;bid&shy;den to you (for food) are: dead meat, blood, the flesh of swine, and that on which hath been in&shy;voked the name of oth&shy;er than God; that which hath been killed by strangling, or by a vi&shy;o&shy;lent blow, or by a head&shy;long fall, or by be&shy;ing gored to death; that which hath been (partly) eat&shy;en by a wild an&shy;i&shy;mal; un&shy;less ye are a&shy;ble to slaugh&shy;ter it (in due form); that which is sacrificed on stone (altars); (forbidden) al&shy;so is the di&shy;vi&shy;sion (of meat) by raffling with ar&shy;rows: that is im&shy;pi&shy;e&shy;ty. This day have those who re&shy;ject faith giv&shy;en up all hope of your re&shy;li&shy;gion: yet fear them not but fear Me. This day have I per&shy;fected your re&shy;li&shy;gion for you, com&shy;plet&shy;ed My fa&shy;vour up&shy;on you, and have cho&shy;sen for you Islam as your re&shy;li&shy;gion. But if any is forced by hun&shy;ger, with no in&shy;cli&shy;na&shy;tion to trans&shy;gres&shy;sion, God is in&shy;deed Oft-forgiving, Most Mer&shy;ci&shy;ful.
    <sup>4</sup>&#8239;They ask thee what is law&shy;ful to them (as food). Say: law&shy;ful un&shy;to you are (all) things good and pure: and what ye have taught your trained hunt&shy;ing an&shy;i&shy;mals (to catch) in the man&shy;ner di&shy;rect&shy;ed to you by God: eat what they catch for you, but pro&shy;nounce the name of God o&shy;ver it: and fear God; for God is swift in tak&shy;ing ac&shy;count.
    <sup>5</sup>&#8239;This day are (all) things good and pure made law&shy;ful un&shy;to you. The food of the Peo&shy;ple of the Book is law&shy;ful un&shy;to you and yours is law&shy;ful un&shy;to them. (Lawful un&shy;to you in mar&shy;riage) are (not on&shy;ly) chaste wom&shy;en who are be&shy;liev&shy;ers, but chaste wom&shy;en a&shy;mong the Peo&shy;ple of the Book, re&shy;vealed be&shy;fore your time,- when ye give them their due dow&shy;ers, and de&shy;sire chas&shy;ti&shy;ty, not lewd&shy;ness, nor se&shy;cret in&shy;trigues if any one re&shy;jects faith, fruit&shy;less is his work, and in the Here&shy;af&shy;ter he will be in the ranks of those who have lost (all spir&shy;it&shy;u&shy;al good).

<p>
    <sup>5:7</sup>&#8239;And call in re&shy;mem&shy;brance the fa&shy;vour of God un&shy;to you, and His cov&shy;e&shy;nant, which He rat&shy;i&shy;fied with you, when ye sa&shy;id: <q>We hear and we o&shy;bey</q>: And fear God, for God knoweth well the se&shy;crets of your hearts.
    <sup>8</sup>&#8239;O ye who be&shy;lieve! stand out firm&shy;ly for God, as witnesses to fair deal&shy;ing, and let not the ha&shy;tred of oth&shy;ers to you make you swerve to wrong and de&shy;part from jus&shy;tice. Be just: that is next to pi&shy;e&shy;ty:  and fear God. For God is well-acquainted with all that ye do.
    <sup>9</sup>&#8239;To those who be&shy;lieve and do deeds of right&shy;eous&shy;ness hath God prom&shy;ised for&shy;give&shy;ness and a great re&shy;ward.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>5:32</sup>&#8239;On that ac&shy;count: We or&shy;dained for the Chil&shy;dren of Israel that if any one slew a per&shy;son - un&shy;less it be for mur&shy;der or for spreading mis&shy;chief in the land - it would be as if he slew the whole peo&shy;ple: and if any one saved a life, it would be as if he saved the life of the whole peo&shy;ple. Then al&shy;though there came to them Our mes&shy;sen&shy;gers with clear signs, yet, e&shy;ven af&shy;ter that, man&shy;y of them con&shy;tin&shy;ued to com&shy;mit excesses in the land.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>5:35</sup>&#8239;O ye who be&shy;lieve! Do your du&shy;ty to God, seek the means of ap&shy;proach un&shy;to Him, and strive with might and main in his cause: that ye may pros&shy;per.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>5:38</sup>&#8239;As to the thief, Male or fe&shy;male, cut off his or her hands: a pun&shy;ish&shy;ment by way of ex&shy;am&shy;ple, from God, for their crime: and God is Ex&shy;alt&shy;ed in pow&shy;er.
    <sup>39</sup>&#8239;But if the thief re&shy;pents af&shy;ter his crime, and a&shy;mends his con&shy;duct, God turneth to him in for&shy;give&shy;ness; for God is Oft-forgiving, Most Mer&shy;ci&shy;ful.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>5:44</sup>&#8239;Fear not men, but fear me, and sell not my signs for a mis&shy;er&shy;a&shy;ble price. If any do fail to judge by (the light of) what God hath re&shy;vealed, they are (no bet&shy;ter than) Un&shy;be&shy;liev&shy;ers.
    <sup>45</sup>&#8239;We or&shy;dained there&shy;in for them: <q>Life for life, eye for eye, nose or nose, ear for ear, tooth for tooth, and wounds e&shy;qual for e&shy;qual.</q> But if any one re&shy;mits the re&shy;tal&shy;i&shy;a&shy;tion by way of char&shy;i&shy;ty, it is an act of a&shy;tone&shy;ment for him&shy;self. And if any fail to judge by (the light of) what God hath re&shy;vealed, they are (No bet&shy;ter than) wrong-doers.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>5:48</sup>&#8239;To thee We sent the Scrip&shy;ture in truth, confirming the scrip&shy;ture that came be&shy;fore it, and guarding it in safe&shy;ty: so judge be&shy;tween them by what God hath re&shy;vealed, and fol&shy;low not their vain de&shy;sires, di&shy;verg&shy;ing from the Truth that hath come to thee. To each a&shy;mong you have we pre&shy;scribed a law and an o&shy;pen way. If God had so willed, He would have made you a sin&shy;gle peo&shy;ple, but (His plan is) to test you in what He hath giv&shy;en you: so strive as in a race in all vir&shy;tues. The goal of you all is to God; it is He that will show you the truth of the mat&shy;ters in which ye dis&shy;pute;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>5:57</sup>&#8239;O ye who be&shy;lieve! take not for friends and pro&shy;tec&shy;tors those who take your re&shy;li&shy;gion for a mock&shy;er&shy;y or sport,- wheth&shy;er a&shy;mong those who re&shy;ceived the Scrip&shy;ture be&shy;fore you, or a&shy;mong those who re&shy;ject Faith; but fear ye God, if ye have faith (indeed).
</p>

<p>
    <sup>5:89</sup>&#8239;God will not call you to ac&shy;count for what is fu&shy;tile in your oaths, but He will call you to ac&shy;count for your de&shy;lib&shy;er&shy;ate oaths: for ex&shy;pi&shy;a&shy;tion, feed ten in&shy;di&shy;gent per&shy;sons, on a scale of the av&shy;er&shy;age for the food of your families; or clothe them; or give a slave his free&shy;dom. If that is be&shy;yond your means, fast for three days. That is the ex&shy;pi&shy;a&shy;tion for the oaths ye have sworn. But keep to your oaths. Thus doth God make clear to you His signs, that ye may be grate&shy;ful.
    <sup>90</sup>&#8239;O ye who be&shy;lieve! In&shy;tox&shy;i&shy;cants and gambling, (dedication of) stones, and (divination by) ar&shy;rows, are an a&shy;bom&shy;i&shy;na&shy;tion,- of Satan&#x02BC;s hand&shy;work: es&shy;chew such (abomination), that ye may pros&shy;per.
    <sup>91</sup>&#8239;Satan&#x02BC;s plan is (but) to ex&shy;cite en&shy;mi&shy;ty and ha&shy;tred be&shy;tween you, with in&shy;tox&shy;i&shy;cants and gambling, and hin&shy;der you from the re&shy;mem&shy;brance of God, and from pray&shy;er: will ye not then ab&shy;stain?
</p>

<p>
    <sup>5:93</sup>&#8239;On those who be&shy;lieve and do deeds of right&shy;eous&shy;ness there is no blame for what they ate (in the past), when they guard them&shy;selves from e&shy;vil, and be&shy;lieve, and do deeds of right&shy;eous&shy;ness,- (or) a&shy;gain, guard them&shy;selves from e&shy;vil and be&shy;lieve,- (or) a&shy;gain, guard them&shy;selves from e&shy;vil and do good.

<p>
    <sup>5:103</sup>&#8239;It was not God who in&shy;sti&shy;tut&shy;ed (superstitions like those of) a slit-ear she-camel, or a she-camel let loose for free pas&shy;ture, or i&shy;dol sac&shy;ri&shy;fices for twin-births in an&shy;i&shy;mals, or stal&shy;lion-camels freed from work: It is blas&shy;phem&shy;ers who in&shy;vent a lie a&shy;gainst God; but most of them lack wis&shy;dom.

    <sup>49</sup>&#8239;But those who re&shy;ject our signs,- them shall pun&shy;ish&shy;ment tou&shy;ch, for that they ceased not from transgressing.

<p>
    <sup>6:52</sup>&#8239;Send not a&shy;way those who call on their Lord morn&shy;ing and eve&shy;ning, seek&shy;ing His face. In naught art thou ac&shy;count&shy;a&shy;ble for them, and in naught are they ac&shy;count&shy;a&shy;ble for thee, that thou shouldst turn them a&shy;way, and thus be (one) of the un&shy;just.
    <sup>53</sup>&#8239;Thus did We try some of them by com&shy;par&shy;i&shy;son with oth&shy;ers, that they should say: <q>Is it these then that God hath fa&shy;voured from a&shy;mongst us?</q> Doth not God know best those who are grate&shy;ful?
    <sup>54</sup>&#8239;When those come to thee who be&shy;lieve in Our signs, Say: <q>Peace be on you: Your Lord hath in&shy;scribed for Him&shy;self (the rule of) mer&shy;cy: ver&shy;i&shy;ly, if any of you did e&shy;vil in ig&shy;no&shy;rance, and there&shy;af&shy;ter re&shy;pented, and a&shy;mend (his con&shy;duct), lo! He is Oft-forgiving, Most Mer&shy;ci&shy;ful.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>6:65</sup>&#8239;Say: <q>He hath pow&shy;er to send calamities on you, from a&shy;bove and be&shy;low, or to cov&shy;er you with con&shy;fu&shy;sion in par&shy;ty strife, giv&shy;ing you a taste of mu&shy;tu&shy;al venge&shy;ance - each from the oth&shy;er.</q> See how We ex&shy;plain the signs by var&shy;i&shy;ous (symbols); that they may un&shy;der&shy;stand.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>6:68</sup>&#8239;When thou seest men en&shy;gaged in vain dis&shy;course a&shy;bout Our signs, turn a&shy;way from them un&shy;less they turn to a dif&shy;fer&shy;ent theme. If Satan ev&shy;er makes thee for&shy;get, then af&shy;ter rec&shy;ol&shy;lec&shy;tion, sit not thou in the com&shy;pa&shy;ny of those who do wrong.
    <sup>69</sup>&#8239;On their ac&shy;count no re&shy;spon&shy;si&shy;bil&shy;i&shy;ty falls on the right&shy;eous, but (their du&shy;ty) is to re&shy;mind them, that they may (learn to) fear God.
    <sup>70</sup>&#8239;Leave a&shy;lone those who take their re&shy;li&shy;gion to be mer&shy;e play and a&shy;muse&shy;ment, and are de&shy;ceived by the life of this world. But pro&shy;claim (to them) this (truth): that eve&shy;ry soul de&shy;liv&shy;ers it&shy;self to ru&shy;in by its own acts: it will find for it&shy;self no pro&shy;tec&shy;tor or in&shy;ter&shy;ces&shy;sor ex&shy;cept God: if it of&shy;fered eve&shy;ry ran&shy;som, (or rep&shy;a&shy;ra&shy;tion), none will be ac&shy;cept&shy;ed: such is (the end of) those who de&shy;liv&shy;er them&shy;selves to ru&shy;in by their own acts: they will have for drink (only) boil&shy;ing wa&shy;ter, and for pun&shy;ish&shy;ment, one most griev&shy;ous: for they per&shy;sisted in rejecting God.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>6:104</sup>&#8239;<q>Now have come to you, from your Lord, proofs (to o&shy;pen your eyes): if any will see, it will be for (the good of) his own soul; if any will be blind, it will be to his own (harm): I am not (here) to watch o&shy;ver your do&shy;ings.</q>
    <sup>105</sup>&#8239;Thus do we ex&shy;plain the signs by var&shy;i&shy;ous (symbols): that they may say, <q>Thou hast taught (us) dil&shy;i&shy;gent&shy;ly,</q> and that We may make the mat&shy;ter clear to those who know.
    <sup>106</sup>&#8239;Fol&shy;low what thou art taught by in&shy;spi&shy;ra&shy;tion from thy Lord: there is no god but He: and turn a&shy;side from those who join gods with God.
    <sup>107</sup>&#8239;If it had been God&#x02BC;s plan, they would not have tak&shy;en false gods: but We made thee not one to watch o&shy;ver their do&shy;ings, nor art thou set o&shy;ver them to dis&shy;pose of their af&shy;fairs.
    <sup>108</sup>&#8239;Re&shy;vile not ye those whom they call up&shy;on be&shy;sides God, lest they out of spite re&shy;vile God in their ig&shy;no&shy;rance. Thus have We made al&shy;lur&shy;ing to each peo&shy;ple its own do&shy;ings. In the end will they re&shy;turn to their Lord, and We shall then tell them the truth of all that they did.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>6:118</sup>&#8239;So eat of (meats) on which God&#x02BC;s name hath been pro&shy;nounced, if ye have faith in His signs.
    <sup>119</sup>&#8239;Why should ye not eat of (meats) on which God&#x02BC;s name hath been pro&shy;nounced, when He hath ex&shy;plained to you in de&shy;tail what is for&shy;bid&shy;den to you - ex&shy;cept un&shy;der com&shy;pul&shy;sion of ne&shy;ces&shy;si&shy;ty? But man&shy;y do mis&shy;lead (men) by their ap&shy;pe&shy;tites un&shy;checked by knowl&shy;edge. Thy Lord knoweth best those who trans&shy;gress.
    <sup>120</sup>&#8239;Es&shy;chew all sin, o&shy;pen or se&shy;cret: those who earn sin will get due rec&shy;om&shy;pense for their <q>earn&shy;ings.</q>
    <sup>121</sup>&#8239;Eat not of (meats) on which God&#x02BC;s name hath not been pro&shy;nounced: That would be im&shy;pi&shy;e&shy;ty. But the e&shy;vil ones ev&shy;er in&shy;spire their friends to con&shy;tend with you if ye were to o&shy;bey them, ye would in&shy;deed be Pa&shy;gans.

<p>
    <sup>6:140</sup>&#8239;Lost are those who slay their chil&shy;dren, from fol&shy;ly, with&shy;out knowl&shy;edge, and for&shy;bid food which Allah hath pro&shy;vid&shy;ed for them, inventing (lies) a&shy;gainst Allah. They have in&shy;deed gone a&shy;stray and heeded no guid&shy;ance.
    <sup>141</sup>&#8239;It is He Who produceth gar&shy;dens, with trellises and with&shy;out, and dates, and tilth with pro&shy;duce of all kinds, and ol&shy;ives and pome&shy;gran&shy;ates, sim&shy;i&shy;lar (in kind) and dif&shy;fer&shy;ent (in va&shy;ri&shy;e&shy;ty): eat of their fruit in their sea&shy;son, but ren&shy;der the dues that are prop&shy;er on the day that the har&shy;vest is gath&shy;ered. But waste not by ex&shy;cess: for God loveth not the wasters.
    <sup>142</sup>&#8239;Of the cat&shy;tle are some for bur&shy;den and some for meat: eat what God hath pro&shy;vid&shy;ed for you, and fol&shy;low not the foot&shy;steps of Satan: for he is to you an a&shy;vowed en&shy;e&shy;my.

    <sup>6:151</sup>&#8239;Say: <q>Come, I will re&shy;hearse what God hath (really) pro&shy;hib&shy;ited you from</q>: Join not any&shy;thing as e&shy;qual with Him; be good to your par&shy;ents; kill not your chil&shy;dren on a plea of want;- We pro&shy;vide sus&shy;te&shy;nance for you and for them;- come not nigh to shame&shy;ful deeds. Wheth&shy;er o&shy;pen or se&shy;cret; take not life, which God hath made sa&shy;cred, ex&shy;cept by way of jus&shy;tice and law: thus doth He com&shy;mand you, that ye may learn wis&shy;dom.

<p>
    <sup>6:160</sup>&#8239;He that do&shy;eth good shall have ten times as much to his cred&shy;it: He that do&shy;eth e&shy;vil shall on&shy;ly be rec&shy;om&shy;pensed ac&shy;cord&shy;ing to his e&shy;vil: no wrong shall be done un&shy;to (any of) them.

    <sup>8:2</sup>&#8239;For, Be&shy;liev&shy;ers are those who, when God is men&shy;tioned, feel a trem&shy;or in their hearts, and when they hear His signs re&shy;hearsed, find their faith strength&shy;ened, and put (all) their trust in their Lord;
    <sup>3</sup>&#8239;Who es&shy;tab&shy;lish reg&shy;u&shy;lar pray&shy;ers and spend (freely) out of the gifts We have giv&shy;en them for sus&shy;te&shy;nance:
    <sup>4</sup>&#8239;Such in truth are the be&shy;liev&shy;ers: they have grades of dig&shy;ni&shy;ty with their Lord, and for&shy;give&shy;ness, and gen&shy;er&shy;ous sus&shy;te&shy;nance:
</p>

<p>
    <sup>8:20</sup>&#8239;O ye who be&shy;lieve! O&shy;bey God and His Mes&shy;sen&shy;ger, and turn not a&shy;way from him when ye hear (him speak).
    <sup>21</sup>&#8239;Nor be like those who say, <q>We hear,</q> but lis&shy;ten not:
    <sup>22</sup>&#8239;For the worst of beasts in the sight of God are the deaf and the dumb,- those who un&shy;der&shy;stand not.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>8:47</sup>&#8239;And be not like those who started from their homes in&shy;so&shy;lent&shy;ly and to be seen of men, and to hin&shy;der (men) from the path of God: For God compasseth round a&shy;bout all that they do.
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>9:24</sup>&#8239;Say: If it be that your fa&shy;thers, your sons, your broth&shy;ers, your mates, or your kin&shy;dred; the wealth that ye have gained; the com&shy;merce in which ye fear a de&shy;cline: or the dwell&shy;ings in which ye de&shy;light - are dearer to you than God, or His Mes&shy;sen&shy;ger, or the striving in His cause;- then wait un&shy;til God brings a&shy;bout His de&shy;ci&shy;sion: and God guides not the re&shy;bel&shy;lious.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>9:34</sup>&#8239;O ye who be&shy;lieve! there are in&shy;deed man&shy;y a&shy;mong the priests and an&shy;cho&shy;rites, who in False&shy;hood de&shy;vour the sub&shy;stance of men and hin&shy;der (them) from the way of God. And there are those who bur&shy;y gold and sil&shy;ver and spend it not in the way of God: an&shy;nounce un&shy;to them a most griev&shy;ous pen&shy;al&shy;ty-
</p>

<p>
    <sup>9:38</sup>&#8239;O ye who be&shy;lieve! what is the mat&shy;ter with you, that, when ye are asked to go forth in the cause of God, ye cling heav&shy;i&shy;ly to the earth? Do ye pre&shy;fer the life of this world to the Here&shy;af&shy;ter? But lit&shy;tle is the com&shy;fort of this life, as com&shy;pared with the Here&shy;af&shy;ter.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>9:41</sup>&#8239;Go ye forth, (whether e&shy;quipped) light&shy;ly or heav&shy;i&shy;ly, and strive and strug&shy;gle, with your goods and your per&shy;sons, in the cause of God. That is best for you, if ye (but) knew.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>9:54</sup>&#8239;The on&shy;ly rea&shy;sons why their con&shy;tri&shy;bu&shy;tions are not ac&shy;cept&shy;ed are: that they re&shy;ject God and His Mes&shy;sen&shy;ger; that they come to pray&shy;er with&shy;out ear&shy;nest&shy;ness; and that they of&shy;fer con&shy;tri&shy;bu&shy;tions un&shy;will&shy;ing&shy;ly.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>9:60</sup>&#8239;Alms are for the poor and the needy, and those em&shy;ployed to ad&shy;min&shy;is&shy;ter the (funds); for those whose hearts have been (recently) rec&shy;on&shy;ciled (to Truth); for those in bond&shy;age and in debt; in the cause of God; and for the way&shy;far&shy;er: (thus is it) or&shy;dained by God, and God is full of knowl&shy;edge and wis&shy;dom.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>9:71</sup>&#8239;The Be&shy;liev&shy;ers, men and wom&shy;en, are pro&shy;tec&shy;tors one of an&shy;oth&shy;er: they en&shy;join what is just, and for&shy;bid what is e&shy;vil: they ob&shy;serve reg&shy;u&shy;lar pray&shy;ers, prac&shy;tise reg&shy;u&shy;lar char&shy;i&shy;ty, and o&shy;bey God and His Mes&shy;sen&shy;ger. On them will God pour His mer&shy;cy: for God is Ex&shy;alt&shy;ed in pow&shy;er, Wise.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>9:74</sup>&#8239;They swear by God that they sa&shy;id noth&shy;ing (evil), but in&shy;deed they ut&shy;tered blas&shy;phe&shy;my, and they did it af&shy;ter accepting Islam; and they med&shy;i&shy;tat&shy;ed a plot which they were un&shy;a&shy;ble to car&shy;ry out: this re&shy;venge of theirs was (their) on&shy;ly re&shy;turn for the boun&shy;ty with which God and His Mes&shy;sen&shy;ger had en&shy;riched them! If they re&shy;pent, it will be best for them; but if they turn back (to their e&shy;vil ways), God will pun&shy;ish them with a griev&shy;ous pen&shy;al&shy;ty in this life and in the Here&shy;af&shy;ter:  They shall have none on earth to pro&shy;tect or help them.
    <sup>75</sup>&#8239;A&shy;mongst them are men who made a cov&shy;e&shy;nant with God, that if He be&shy;stowed on them of His boun&shy;ty, they would give (largely) in char&shy;i&shy;ty, and be tru&shy;ly a&shy;mongst those who are right&shy;eous.
    <sup>76</sup>&#8239;But when He did be&shy;stow of His boun&shy;ty, they be&shy;came cov&shy;et&shy;ous, and turned back (from their cov&shy;e&shy;nant), a&shy;verse (from its ful&shy;fil&shy;ment).
    <sup>77</sup>&#8239;So He hath put as a con&shy;se&shy;quence hy&shy;poc&shy;ri&shy;sy in&shy;to their hearts, (to last) till the Day, where&shy;on they shall meet Him: be&shy;cause they broke their cov&shy;e&shy;nant with God, and be&shy;cause they lied (again and a&shy;gain).
</p>

<p>
    <sup>9:91</sup>&#8239;There is no blame on those who are in&shy;firm, or ill, or who find no re&shy;sources to spend (on the cause), if they are sin&shy;cere (in du&shy;ty) to God and His Mes&shy;sen&shy;ger: no ground (of com&shy;plaint) can there be a&shy;gainst such as do right: and God is Oft-forgiving, Most Mer&shy;ci&shy;ful.
    <sup>92</sup>&#8239;Nor (is there blame) on those who came to thee to be pro&shy;vid&shy;ed with mounts, and when thou saidst, <q>I can find no mounts for you,</q> they turned back, their eyes stream&shy;ing with tears of grief that they had no re&shy;sources where&shy;with to pro&shy;vide the ex&shy;penses.
    <sup>93</sup>&#8239;The ground (of com&shy;plaint) is a&shy;gainst such as claim ex&shy;emp&shy;tion while they are rich. They pre&shy;fer to stay with the (women) who re&shy;main be&shy;hind: God hath sealed their hearts; so they know not (What they mi&shy;ss).
</p>

<p>
    <sup>9:104</sup>&#8239;Know they not that God doth ac&shy;cept re&shy;pent&shy;ance from His votaries and re&shy;ceives their gifts of char&shy;i&shy;ty, and that God is ver&shy;i&shy;ly He, the Oft-Returning, Most Mer&shy;ci&shy;ful?
</p>

<p>
    <sup>9:108</sup>&#8239;Nev&shy;er stand thou forth there&shy;in. There is a mosque whose foun&shy;da&shy;tion was laid from the first day on pi&shy;e&shy;ty; it is more wor&shy;thy of the stand&shy;ing forth (for pray&shy;er) there&shy;in. In it are men who love to be pu&shy;ri&shy;fied; and God loveth those who make them&shy;selves pure.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>9:115</sup>&#8239;And God will not mis&shy;lead a peo&shy;ple af&shy;ter He hath guid&shy;ed them, in or&shy;der that He may make clear to them what to fear (and a&shy;void)- for God hath knowl&shy;edge of all things.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>9:119</sup>&#8239;O ye who be&shy;lieve! Fear God and be with those who are true (in word and deed).
</p>

<p>
    <sup>9:122</sup>&#8239;Nor should the Be&shy;liev&shy;ers all go forth to&shy;geth&shy;er: if a con&shy;tin&shy;gent from eve&shy;ry ex&shy;pe&shy;di&shy;tion re&shy;mained be&shy;hind, they could de&shy;vote them&shy;selves to stud&shy;ies in re&shy;li&shy;gion, and ad&shy;mon&shy;ish the peo&shy;ple when they re&shy;turn to them,- that thus they (may learn) to guard them&shy;selves (against e&shy;vil).
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>10:11</sup>&#8239;If God were to has&shy;ten for men the ill (they have earned) as they would fain has&shy;ten on the good,- then would their res&shy;pite be settled at once. But We leave those who rest not their hope on their meet&shy;ing with Us, in their trespasses, wan&shy;der&shy;ing in dis&shy;trac&shy;tion to and fro.
    <sup>12</sup>&#8239;When trou&shy;ble toucheth a man, He crieth un&shy;to Us (in all pos&shy;tures)- ly&shy;ing down on his side, or sit&shy;ting, or stand&shy;ing. But when We have solved his trou&shy;ble, he passeth on his way as if he had nev&shy;er cried to Us for a trou&shy;ble that tou&shy;ched him! thus do the deeds of transgressors seem fair in their eyes!
</p>

<p>
    <sup>10:17</sup>&#8239;Who doth more wrong than such as forge a lie a&shy;gainst God, or de&shy;ny His Signs? But nev&shy;er will pros&shy;per those who sin.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>10:22</sup>&#8239;He it is Who enableth you to trav&shy;erse through land and sea; so that ye e&shy;ven board ships;- they sail with them with a fa&shy;vour&shy;a&shy;ble wind, and they re&shy;joice there&shy;at; then co&shy;mes a storm&shy;y wind and the waves come to them from all sides, and they think they are be&shy;ing o&shy;ver&shy;whelmed: they cry un&shy;to God, sin&shy;cere&shy;ly of&shy;fer&shy;ing (their) du&shy;ty un&shy;to Him say&shy;ing, <q>If thou dost de&shy;liv&shy;er us from this, we shall tru&shy;ly show our grat&shy;i&shy;tude!</q>
    <sup>23</sup>&#8239;But when he delivereth them, be&shy;hold! they trans&shy;gress in&shy;so&shy;lent&shy;ly through the earth in de&shy;fi&shy;ance of right! O man&shy;kind! your in&shy;so&shy;lence is a&shy;gainst your own souls,- an en&shy;joy&shy;ment of the life of the pre&shy;sent: in the end, to Us is your re&shy;turn, and We shall show you the truth of all that ye did.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>10:41</sup>&#8239;If they charge thee with false&shy;hood, say: <q>My work to me, and yours to you! Ye are free from re&shy;spon&shy;si&shy;bil&shy;i&shy;ty for what I do, and I for what ye do!</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>10:47</sup>&#8239;To eve&shy;ry peo&shy;ple (was sent) a mes&shy;sen&shy;ger: when their mes&shy;sen&shy;ger co&shy;mes (before them), the mat&shy;ter will be judged be&shy;tween them with jus&shy;tice, and they will not be wronged.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>10:59</sup>&#8239;Say: <q>See ye what things God hath sent down to you for sus&shy;te&shy;nance? Yet ye hold for&shy;bid&shy;den some things there&shy;of and (some things) law&shy;ful.</q> Say: <q>Hath God in&shy;deed permitted you, or do ye in&shy;vent (things) to at&shy;trib&shy;ute to God?</q>
    <sup>60</sup>&#8239;And what think those who in&shy;vent lies a&shy;gainst God, of the Day of Judg&shy;ment? Ver&shy;i&shy;ly God is full of boun&shy;ty to man&shy;kind, but most of them are un&shy;grate&shy;ful.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>10:62</sup>&#8239;Be&shy;hold! ver&shy;i&shy;ly on the friends of God there is no fear, nor shall they grieve;
    <sup>63</sup>&#8239;Those who be&shy;lieve and (constantly) guard a&shy;gainst e&shy;vil;-
    <sup>64</sup>&#8239;For them are glad tid&shy;ings, in the life of the pre&shy;sent and in the Here&shy;af&shy;ter; no change can there be in the words of God. This is in&shy;deed the su&shy;preme fe&shy;lic&shy;i&shy;ty.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>10:101</sup>&#8239;Say: <q>Be&shy;hold all that is in the heav&shy;ens and on earth</q>; but nei&shy;ther Signs nor Warn&shy;ers prof&shy;it those who be&shy;lieve not.

<p>
    <sup>11:9</sup>&#8239;If We give man a taste of Mer&shy;cy from Our&shy;selves, and then with&shy;draw it from him, be&shy;hold! he is in de&shy;spair and (falls in&shy;to) blas&shy;phe&shy;my.

    <sup>11</sup>&#8239;Not so do those who show pa&shy;tience and con&shy;stan&shy;cy, and work right&shy;eous&shy;ness; for them is for&shy;give&shy;ness (of sins) and a great re&shy;ward.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>11:84</sup>&#8239;To the Madyan Peo&shy;ple (We sent) Shu&#x02BC;aib, one of their own breth&shy;ren: he sa&shy;id: <q>O my peo&shy;ple! wor&shy;ship God: Ye have no oth&shy;er god but Him. And give not short meas&shy;ure or weight: I see you in pros&shy;per&shy;i&shy;ty, but I fear for you the pen&shy;al&shy;ty of a day that will com&shy;pass (you) all round.
    <sup>85</sup>&#8239;And O my peo&shy;ple! give just meas&shy;ure and weight, nor with&shy;hold from the peo&shy;ple the things that are their due: com&shy;mit not e&shy;vil in the land with in&shy;tent to do mis&shy;chief.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>11:112</sup>&#8239;There&shy;fore stand firm (in the straight Path) as thou art com&shy;manded,- thou and those who with thee turn (unto God); and trans&shy;gress not (from the Path): for He seeth well all that ye do.
    <sup>113</sup>&#8239;And in&shy;cline not to those who do wrong, or the Fire will seize you; and ye have no pro&shy;tec&shy;tors oth&shy;er than God, nor shall ye be helped.
    <sup>114</sup>&#8239;And es&shy;tab&shy;lish reg&shy;u&shy;lar pray&shy;ers at the two ends of the day and at the approaches of the night: For those things, that are good re&shy;move those that are e&shy;vil: Be that the word of re&shy;mem&shy;brance to those who re&shy;mem&shy;ber (their Lord):
    <sup>115</sup>&#8239;And be stead&shy;fast in pa&shy;tience; for ver&shy;i&shy;ly God will not suf&shy;fer the re&shy;ward of the right&shy;eous to per&shy;ish.

<p>
    <sup>11:117</sup>&#8239;Nor would thy Lord be the One to de&shy;stroy communities for a sin&shy;gle wrong-doing, if its mem&shy;bers were like&shy;ly to mend.

    <sup>16:61</sup>&#8239;If God were to pun&shy;ish men for their wrong-doing, He would not leave, on the (earth), a sin&shy;gle liv&shy;ing crea&shy;ture: but He gives them res&shy;pite for a stat&shy;ed Term: When their Term ex&shy;pires, they would not be a&shy;ble to de&shy;lay (the pun&shy;ish&shy;ment) for a sin&shy;gle hour, just as they would not be a&shy;ble to an&shy;tic&shy;i&shy;pate it (for a sin&shy;gle hour).

<p>
    <sup>16:71</sup>&#8239;God has be&shy;stowed His gifts of sus&shy;te&shy;nance more free&shy;ly on some of you than on oth&shy;ers: those more fa&shy;voured are not go&shy;ing to throw back their gifts to those whom their right hands pos&shy;sess, so as to be e&shy;qual in that re&shy;spect.

    <sup>92</sup>&#8239;And be not like a wom&shy;an who breaks in&shy;to untwisted strands the yarn which she has spun, af&shy;ter it has be&shy;come strong. Nor take your oaths to prac&shy;tise de&shy;cep&shy;tion be&shy;tween yourselves, lest one par&shy;ty should be more nu&shy;mer&shy;ous than an&shy;oth&shy;er: for God will test you by this; and on the Day of Judg&shy;ment He will cer&shy;tain&shy;ly make clear to you (the truth of) that where&shy;in ye dis&shy;a&shy;gree.
    <sup>93</sup>&#8239;If God so willed, He could make you all one peo&shy;ple: But He leaves straying whom He pleases, and He guides whom He pleases: but ye shall cer&shy;tain&shy;ly be called to ac&shy;count for all your ac&shy;tions.
    <sup>94</sup>&#8239;And take not your oaths, to prac&shy;tise de&shy;cep&shy;tion be&shy;tween yourselves, with the re&shy;sult that some&shy;one&#x02BC;s foot may slip af&shy;ter it was firm&shy;ly planted, and ye may have to taste the e&shy;vil (consequences) of hav&shy;ing hind&shy;ered (men) from the Path of God, and a Might&shy;y Wrath de&shy;scend on you.

    <sup>111</sup>&#8239;One Day eve&shy;ry soul will come up struggling for it&shy;self, and eve&shy;ry soul will be rec&shy;om&shy;pensed (fully) for all its ac&shy;tions, and none will be un&shy;just&shy;ly dealt with.

    <sup>19</sup>&#8239;Those who do wish for the (things of) the Here&shy;af&shy;ter, and strive there&shy;for with all due striving, and have Faith,- they are the ones whose striving is ac&shy;cept&shy;a&shy;ble (to God).

    <sup>25:22</sup>&#8239;The Day they see the an&shy;gels,- no joy will there be to the sin&shy;ners that Day: The (angels) will say: <q>There is a bar&shy;ri&shy;er for&shy;bid&shy;den (to you) al&shy;to&shy;geth&shy;er!</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>25:27</sup>&#8239;The Day that the wrong-doer will bite at his hands, he will say, <q>Oh! would that I had tak&shy;en a (straight) path with the Mes&shy;sen&shy;ger!
    <sup>28</sup>&#8239;Ah! woe is me! Would that I had nev&shy;er tak&shy;en such a one for a friend!
    <sup>29</sup>&#8239;He did lead me a&shy;stray from the Mes&shy;sage (of God) af&shy;ter it had come to me! Ah! the E&shy;vil One is but a trai&shy;tor to man!</q>

<p>
    <sup>25:32</sup>&#8239;Those who re&shy;ject Faith say: <q>Why is not the Qur&#x02BC;an re&shy;vealed to him all at once?</q> Thus (is it re&shy;vealed), that We may strength&shy;en thy heart there&shy;by, and We have re&shy;hearsed it to thee in slow, well-arranged stages, grad&shy;u&shy;al&shy;ly.

<p>
    <sup>25:43</sup>&#8239;Seest thou such a one as taketh for his god his own pas&shy;sion (or im&shy;pulse)? Couldst thou be a dis&shy;pos&shy;er of af&shy;fairs for him?

    <sup>49</sup>&#8239;That with it We may give life to a dead land, and slake the thirst of things We have cre&shy;at&shy;ed,- cat&shy;tle and men in great num&shy;bers.

<p>
    <sup>25:63</sup>&#8239;And the serv&shy;ants of (God) Most Gra&shy;cious are those who walk on the earth in hu&shy;mil&shy;i&shy;ty, and when the ig&shy;no&shy;rant ad&shy;dress them, they say, <q>Peace!</q>;

    <sup>48</sup>&#8239;But (now), when the Truth has come to them from Our&shy;selves, they say, <q>Why are not (Signs) sent to him, like those which were sent to Mo&shy;ses?</q> Do they not then re&shy;ject (the Signs) which were for&shy;mer&shy;ly sent to Mo&shy;ses?

    <sup>56</sup>&#8239;It is true thou wilt not be a&shy;ble to guide eve&shy;ry one, whom thou lovest; but God guides those whom He will and He knows best those who re&shy;ceive guid&shy;ance.

<p>
    <sup>30:36</sup>&#8239;When We give men a taste of Mer&shy;cy, they ex&shy;ult there&shy;at: and when some e&shy;vil af&shy;flicts them be&shy;cause of what their (own) hands have sent forth, be&shy;hold, they are in de&shy;spair!
</p>

<p>
    <sup>30:38</sup>&#8239;So give what is due to kin&shy;dred, the needy, and the way&shy;far&shy;er. That is best for those who seek the Coun&shy;te&shy;nance, of God, and it is they who will pros&shy;per.
    <sup>39</sup>&#8239;That which ye lay out for in&shy;crease through the prop&shy;er&shy;ty of (other) peo&shy;ple, will have no in&shy;crease with God: but that which ye lay out for char&shy;i&shy;ty, seek&shy;ing the Coun&shy;te&shy;nance of God, (will in&shy;crease): it is these who will get a rec&shy;om&shy;pense mul&shy;ti&shy;plied.

    <sup>30:44</sup>&#8239;Those who re&shy;ject Faith will suf&shy;fer from that re&shy;jec&shy;tion: and those who work right&shy;eous&shy;ness will spread their couch (of re&shy;pose) for them&shy;selves (in heav&shy;en):
    <sup>45</sup>&#8239;That He may re&shy;ward those who be&shy;lieve and work right&shy;eous deeds, out of his Boun&shy;ty. For He loves not those who re&shy;ject Faith.
    <sup>46</sup>&#8239;A&shy;mong His Signs is this, that He sends the Winds, as her&shy;alds of Glad Tid&shy;ings, giv&shy;ing you a taste of His (Grace and) Mer&shy;cy,- that the ships may sail (majestically) by His Com&shy;mand and that ye may seek of His Boun&shy;ty: in or&shy;der that ye may be grate&shy;ful.
    <sup>47</sup>&#8239;We did in&shy;deed send, be&shy;fore thee, mes&shy;sen&shy;gers to their (respective) peo&shy;ples, and they came to them with Clear Signs: then, to those who trans&shy;gressed, We met&shy;ed out Ret&shy;ri&shy;bu&shy;tion: and it was due from Us to aid those who be&shy;lieved.

    <sup>42:13</sup>&#8239;The same re&shy;li&shy;gion has He es&shy;tab&shy;lished for you as that which He en&shy;joined on No&shy;ah - the which We have sent by in&shy;spi&shy;ra&shy;tion to thee - and that which We en&shy;joined on Abraham, Mo&shy;ses, and Jesus: Name&shy;ly, that ye should re&shy;main stead&shy;fast in re&shy;li&shy;gion, and make no di&shy;vi&shy;sions there&shy;in: to those who wor&shy;ship oth&shy;er things than God, hard is the (way) to which thou callest them.

    <sup>14</sup>&#8239;And they be&shy;came di&shy;vid&shy;ed on&shy;ly af&shy;ter Knowl&shy;edge reached them,- through self&shy;ish en&shy;vy as be&shy;tween them&shy;selves. Had it not been for a Word that went forth be&shy;fore from thy Lord, (tending) to a Term ap&shy;point&shy;ed, the mat&shy;ter would have been settled be&shy;tween them: But tru&shy;ly those who have in&shy;her&shy;it&shy;ed the Book af&shy;ter them are in sus&shy;pi&shy;cious (disquieting) doubt con&shy;cern&shy;ing it.
    <sup>15</sup>&#8239;Now then, for that (reason), call (them to the Faith), and stand stead&shy;fast as thou art com&shy;manded, nor fol&shy;low thou their vain de&shy;sires;  but say: <q>I be&shy;lieve in the Book which God has sent down; and I am com&shy;manded to judge just&shy;ly be&shy;tween you. God is our Lord and your Lord: for us (is the re&shy;spon&shy;si&shy;bil&shy;i&shy;ty for) our deeds, and for you for your deeds. There is no con&shy;ten&shy;tion be&shy;tween us and you.

    <sup>42:23</sup>&#8239;That is (the Boun&shy;ty) where&shy;of God gives Glad Tid&shy;ings to His Serv&shy;ants who be&shy;lieve and do right&shy;eous deeds.

</p>

<p>
    <sup>42:27</sup>&#8239;If God were to en&shy;large the pro&shy;vi&shy;sion for His Serv&shy;ants, they would in&shy;deed trans&shy;gress be&shy;yond all bounds through the earth; but he sends (it) down in due meas&shy;ure as He pleases.

<p>
    <sup>42:36</sup>&#8239;What&shy;ev&shy;er ye are giv&shy;en (here) is (but) a con&shy;ven&shy;i&shy;ence of this life: but that which is with God is bet&shy;ter and more last&shy;ing:  (it is) for those who be&shy;lieve and put their trust in their Lord:
    <sup>37</sup>&#8239;Those who a&shy;void the greater crimes and shame&shy;ful deeds, and, when they are an&shy;gry e&shy;ven then for&shy;give;
    <sup>38</sup>&#8239;Those who heark&shy;en to their Lord, and es&shy;tab&shy;lish reg&shy;u&shy;lar Pray&shy;er; who (conduct) their af&shy;fairs by mu&shy;tu&shy;al Con&shy;sul&shy;ta&shy;tion; who spend out of what We be&shy;stow on them for Sus&shy;te&shy;nance;
    <sup>39</sup>&#8239;And those who, when an op&shy;pres&shy;sive wrong is in&shy;flicted on them, (are not cowed but) help and de&shy;fend them&shy;selves.
    <sup>40</sup>&#8239;The rec&shy;om&shy;pense for an in&shy;ju&shy;ry is an in&shy;ju&shy;ry e&shy;qual there&shy;to (in de&shy;gree): but if a per&shy;son for&shy;gives and makes reconciliation, his re&shy;ward is due from God: for (God) loveth not those who do wrong.
    <sup>41</sup>&#8239;But in&shy;deed if any do help and de&shy;fend them&shy;selves af&shy;ter a wrong (done) to them, a&shy;gainst such there is no cause of blame.
    <sup>42</sup>&#8239;The blame is on&shy;ly a&shy;gainst those who op&shy;press men and wrong-doing and in&shy;so&shy;lent&shy;ly trans&shy;gress be&shy;yond bounds through the land, defying right and jus&shy;tice: for such there will be a pen&shy;al&shy;ty griev&shy;ous.
    <sup>43</sup>&#8239;But in&shy;deed if any show pa&shy;tience and for&shy;give, that would tru&shy;ly be an ex&shy;er&shy;cise of cou&shy;ra&shy;geous will and res&shy;o&shy;lu&shy;tion in the con&shy;duct of af&shy;fairs.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>42:48</sup>&#8239;If then they run a&shy;way, We have not sent thee as a guard o&shy;ver them. Thy du&shy;ty is but to con&shy;vey (the Mes&shy;sage).

    <sup>21</sup>&#8239;And soon will they at&shy;tain (complete) sat&shy;is&shy;fac&shy;tion.

<p>
    <sup>93:3</sup>&#8239;Thy Guard&shy;i&shy;an-Lord hath not for&shy;sak&shy;en thee, nor is He dis&shy;pleased.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>93:6</sup>&#8239;Did He not find thee an or&shy;phan and give thee shel&shy;ter (and care)?
    <sup>7</sup>&#8239;And He found thee wan&shy;der&shy;ing, and He gave thee guid&shy;ance.
    <sup>8</sup>&#8239;And He found thee in need, and made thee in&shy;de&shy;pend&shy;ent.
    <sup>9</sup>&#8239;There&shy;fore, treat not the or&shy;phan with harsh&shy;ness,
    <sup>10</sup>&#8239;Nor re&shy;pulse the pe&shy;ti&shy;tion&shy;er (unheard);
    <sup>11</sup>&#8239;But the boun&shy;ty of the Lord - re&shy;hearse and pro&shy;claim!
</p>

<p>
    <sup>94:5</sup>&#8239;So, ver&shy;i&shy;ly, with eve&shy;ry dif&shy;fi&shy;cul&shy;ty, there is re&shy;lief:
    <sup>6</sup>&#8239;Ver&shy;i&shy;ly, with eve&shy;ry dif&shy;fi&shy;cul&shy;ty there is re&shy;lief.
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>96:1</sup>&#8239;Pro&shy;claim! (or read!) in the name of thy Lord and Cher&shy;ish&shy;er, Who cre&shy;at&shy;ed-
    <sup>2</sup>&#8239;Cre&shy;at&shy;ed man, out of a (mere) clot of con&shy;gealed blood:
    <sup>3</sup>&#8239;Pro&shy;claim! And thy Lord is Most Boun&shy;ti&shy;ful,-
    <sup>4</sup>&#8239;He Who taught (the use of) the pen,-
    <sup>5</sup>&#8239;Taught man that which he knew not.
    <sup>6</sup>&#8239;Nay, but man doth trans&shy;gress all bounds,
    <sup>7</sup>&#8239;In that he looketh up&shy;on him&shy;self as self-sufficient.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>96:9</sup>&#8239;Seest thou one who for&shy;bids-
    <sup>10</sup>&#8239;A vo&shy;ta&shy;ry when he (turns) to pray?
    <sup>11</sup>&#8239;Seest thou if he is on (the road of) Guid&shy;ance?-
    <sup>12</sup>&#8239;Or en&shy;joins Right&shy;eous&shy;ness?
</p>

<p>
    <sup>96:19</sup>&#8239;Nay, heed him not: But bow down in ad&shy;o&shy;ra&shy;tion, and bring thy&shy;self the clos&shy;er (to God)!

<p>
    <sup>98:1</sup>&#8239;Those who re&shy;ject (Truth), a&shy;mong the Peo&shy;ple of the Book and a&shy;mong the Pol&shy;y&shy;the&shy;ists, were not go&shy;ing to de&shy;part (from their ways) un&shy;til there should come to them Clear Ev&shy;i&shy;dence,-
    <sup>2</sup>&#8239;An mes&shy;sen&shy;ger from God, re&shy;hears&shy;ing scrip&shy;tures kept pure and ho&shy;ly:
    <sup>3</sup>&#8239;Where&shy;in are laws (or de&shy;crees) right and straight.
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>104:1</sup>&#8239;Woe to eve&shy;ry (kind of) scan&shy;dal-monger and-backbiter,
    <sup>2</sup>&#8239;Who pileth up wealth and layeth it by,
    <sup>3</sup>&#8239;Think&shy;ing that his wealth would make him last for ev&shy;er!
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>107:1</sup>&#8239;Seest thou one who denies the Judg&shy;ment (to come)?
    <sup>2</sup>&#8239;Then such is the (man) who re&shy;pulses the or&shy;phan (with harsh&shy;ness),
    <sup>3</sup>&#8239;And en&shy;cour&shy;ages not the feed&shy;ing of the in&shy;di&shy;gent.
    <sup>4</sup>&#8239;So woe to the worshippers
    <sup>5</sup>&#8239;Who are ne&shy;glect&shy;ful of their pray&shy;ers,
    <sup>6</sup>&#8239;Those who (want but) to be seen (of men),
    <sup>7</sup>&#8239;But re&shy;fuse (to sup&shy;ply) (even) neigh&shy;bour&shy;ly needs.
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>109:1</sup>&#8239;Say: O ye that re&shy;ject Faith!
    <sup>2</sup>&#8239;I wor&shy;ship not that which ye wor&shy;ship,
    <sup>3</sup>&#8239;Nor will ye wor&shy;ship that which I wor&shy;ship.
    <sup>4</sup>&#8239;And I will not wor&shy;ship that which ye have been wont to wor&shy;ship,
    <sup>5</sup>&#8239;Nor will ye wor&shy;ship that which I wor&shy;ship.
    <sup>6</sup>&#8239;To you be your Way, and to me mine.

<p>
    <sup>110:2</sup>&#8239;And thou dost see the peo&shy;ple en&shy;ter God&#x02BC;s Re&shy;li&shy;gion in crowds,
    <sup>3</sup>&#8239;Cel&shy;e&shy;brate the praises of thy Lord, and pray for His For&shy;give&shy;ness: For He is Oft-Returning (in Grace and Mer&shy;cy).
