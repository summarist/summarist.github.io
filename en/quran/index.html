    <p>
    <sup>1:1</sup>&#8239;In the name of God, Most Gra&shy;cious, Most Mer&shy;ci&shy;ful.
    <sup>2</sup>&#8239;All praise is owed to God, sus&shy;tain&shy;er of the worlds,
    <sup>4</sup>&#8239;Mas&shy;ter of the Day of Judg&shy;ment.
    <sup>5</sup>&#8239;You a&shy;lone we wor&shy;ship, and you a&shy;lone we ask for help.
    <sup>6</sup>&#8239;Guide us to the straight path.
    <sup>7</sup>&#8239;The path of those you have bless&shy;ed, not of those who earned your an&shy;ger, nor of those who stray.
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>2:2</sup>&#8239;This book, a&shy;bout which there is no doubt, is a guid&shy;ance for those con&shy;scious of God,
    <sup>3</sup>&#8239;who be&shy;lieve in the un&shy;seen, are stead&shy;fast in pray&shy;er, give out of what We have pro&shy;vid&shy;ed for them,
    <sup>4</sup>&#8239;and who be&shy;lieve in the rev&shy;e&shy;la&shy;tion sent to you, [Muhammad], and what was sent be&shy;fore your time, and who have firm faith in the here&shy;af&shy;ter.
    <sup>5</sup>&#8239;They are fol&shy;low&shy;ing guid&shy;ance from their Lord, and it is they who will pros&shy;per.
    <sup>6</sup>&#8239;As to those who dis&shy;be&shy;lieve, it is the same to them wheth&shy;er you warn them or not: they won&#x02BC;t be&shy;lieve.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:42</sup>&#8239;Do not mix truth with false&shy;hood, nor know&shy;ing&shy;ly con&shy;ceal the truth.
    <sup>43</sup>&#8239;Be stead&shy;fast in pray&shy;er, spend in char&shy;i&shy;ty, and bow down with those who bow down in wor&shy;ship.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:44</sup>&#8239;Do you en&shy;join right&shy;eous&shy;ness on the peo&shy;ple, and for&shy;get to do it your&shy;selves, e&shy;ven though you re&shy;cite the Scrip&shy;ture? Have you no sense?
    <sup>45</sup>&#8239;Seek help with pa&shy;tience and pray&shy;er. It is dif&shy;fi&shy;cult in&shy;deed, ex&shy;cept for the hum&shy;ble,
    <sup>46</sup>&#8239;who are cer&shy;tain that they will meet their Lord and re&shy;turn to Him.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:62</sup>&#8239;All who be&shy;lieve in God and the Last Day, and do right&shy;eous&shy;ness, will have their re&shy;ward with their Lord. They will have no fear, nor will they grieve.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:79</sup>&#8239;Woe to those who write a book with their own hands then say, <q>This is from God,</q> in or&shy;der to sell it for a small price!
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:83</sup>&#8239;Re&shy;mem&shy;ber that We took a cov&shy;e&shy;nant from the Chil&shy;dren of Israel: <q>Wor&shy;ship none but God. Do good to your par&shy;ents and rel&shy;a&shy;tives, to or&shy;phans and the poor; speak good words to peo&shy;ple; be stead&shy;fast in pray&shy;er; and spend in char&shy;i&shy;ty.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:111</sup>&#8239;They say, <q>None will en&shy;ter Par&shy;a&shy;dise un&shy;less he is a Jew or a Christian.</q>
    <sup>112</sup>&#8239;In fact, who&shy;ev&shy;er sub&shy;mits him&shy;self whol&shy;ly to God and does good will have his re&shy;ward with his Lord. They will have no fear, nor will they grieve.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:135</sup>&#8239;They say, <q>Be&shy;come Jews or Christians, then you will be right&shy;ly guid&shy;ed.</q> Say, <q>No, we fol&shy;low the re&shy;li&shy;gion of Abraham, who wor&shy;shipped no god be&shy;sides God.</q>
    <sup>136</sup>&#8239;Say, <q>We be&shy;lieve in God, and the rev&shy;e&shy;la&shy;tion giv&shy;en to us, and to Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob, and their de&shy;scend&shy;ants, and the rev&shy;e&shy;la&shy;tion giv&shy;en to Mo&shy;ses, Jesus, and the proph&shy;ets from their Lord.  We make no dis&shy;tinc&shy;tion be&shy;tween any of them, and we sub&shy;mit to Him.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:153</sup>&#8239;O you who be&shy;lieve, seek help through pa&shy;tience and pray&shy;er. For God is with the stead&shy;fast.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:172</sup>&#8239;O you who be&shy;lieve, eat the good things We have pro&shy;vid&shy;ed for you, and be grate&shy;ful to God, if it is Him you wor&shy;ship.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:177</sup>&#8239;Right&shy;eous&shy;ness is not turn&shy;ing your faces to&shy;wards East or West, but right&shy;eous&shy;ness is one who be&shy;lieves in God, the Last Day, the an&shy;gels, the Book, and the proph&shy;ets; who gives of his wealth, e&shy;ven though he loves it, to rel&shy;a&shy;tives, or&shy;phans, the needy, the trav&shy;el&shy;er, beg&shy;gars, and for free&shy;ing slaves; who are stead&shy;fast in pray&shy;er, and spend in char&shy;i&shy;ty; who keep their prom&shy;ises; and are pa&shy;tient in pov&shy;er&shy;ty, ad&shy;ver&shy;si&shy;ty, and dur&shy;ing bat&shy;tle. These ones are true, and con&shy;scious of God.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:180</sup>&#8239;When death approaches any of you and he leaves be&shy;hind wealth, it is pre&shy;scribed that he make a prop&shy;er be&shy;quest to par&shy;ents and near rel&shy;a&shy;tives. This is a du&shy;ty for those con&shy;scious of God.
    <sup>181</sup>&#8239;If any&shy;one al&shy;ters the be&shy;quest af&shy;ter hear&shy;ing it, the sin is on them: God hears and knows all.
    <sup>182</sup>&#8239;But if any&shy;one fears that the tes&shy;ta&shy;tor made a mis&shy;take or did wrong, and makes peace be&shy;tween the heirs, he in&shy;curs no sin: God is for&shy;giv&shy;ing and mer&shy;ci&shy;ful.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:183</sup>&#8239;O you who be&shy;lieve, fasting is pre&shy;scribed for you, as it was for those be&shy;fore you, that you may be&shy;come con&shy;scious of God.
    <sup>184</sup>&#8239;Fast for a spe&shy;cif&shy;ic num&shy;ber of days, but if you are sick or trav&shy;el&shy;ing, make up the days lat&shy;er. Those who can on&shy;ly fast with dif&shy;fi&shy;cul&shy;ty may feed a poor per&shy;son in&shy;stead. Who&shy;ev&shy;er vol&shy;un&shy;teers to give more, it is bet&shy;ter for him. Fasting is bet&shy;ter for you, if you on&shy;ly knew.
    <sup>185</sup>&#8239;In the month of Ramadan the Quran was re&shy;vealed as a guid&shy;ance for man&shy;kind, as a clear sign of that guid&shy;ance, and as judg&shy;ment be&shy;tween right and wrong. So who&shy;ev&shy;er is pre&shy;sent dur&shy;ing that month should fast. God wants ease for you, not hard&shy;ship; and per&shy;haps you will be grate&shy;ful.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:188</sup>&#8239;Don&#x02BC;t con&shy;sume one an&shy;oth&shy;er&#x02BC;s prop&shy;er&shy;ty un&shy;just&shy;ly, nor use it to bribe judges, intending to con&shy;sume some of the prop&shy;er&shy;ty of oth&shy;ers sin&shy;ful&shy;ly and know&shy;ing&shy;ly.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:215</sup>&#8239;They ask you what they should spend in char&shy;i&shy;ty. Say, <q>What&shy;ev&shy;er you spend should be for par&shy;ents, close rel&shy;a&shy;tives, or&shy;phans, the poor, and for trav&shy;el&shy;ers.  What&shy;ev&shy;er good you do, God knows it well.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:216</sup>&#8239;You may dis&shy;like some&shy;thing that&#x02BC;s good for you, and love some&shy;thing that&#x02BC;s bad for you. God knows, and you do not.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:219</sup>&#8239;They ask you a&shy;bout wine and gambling. Say, <q>In them is great sin, yet some ben&shy;e&shy;fit, but the sin is greater than the ben&shy;e&shy;fit.</q> They ask you how much they should give. Say, <q>The ex&shy;cess.</q>
    <sup>220</sup>&#8239;They ask you a&shy;bout or&shy;phans. Say, <q>Im&shy;prov&shy;ing their con&shy;di&shy;tion is best. If you mix their af&shy;fairs with yours, they are your broth&shy;ers. God knows who spoils things and who im&shy;proves them. If God had wished, He could have put you in&shy;to difficul&shy;ties.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:221</sup>&#8239;Don&#x02BC;t mar&shy;ry i&shy;dol&shy;a&shy;trous wom&shy;en un&shy;til they be&shy;lieve. A slave who be&shy;lieves is bet&shy;ter than an i&shy;dol&shy;a&shy;tress, e&shy;ven if she pleases you. Don&#x02BC;t mar&shy;ry your daugh&shy;ters to i&shy;dol&shy;a&shy;trous men un&shy;til they be&shy;lieve. A slave who be&shy;lieves is bet&shy;ter than an i&shy;dol&shy;a&shy;ter, e&shy;ven if he pleases you. These in&shy;vite you to the fire.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:225</sup>&#8239;God will not call you to ac&shy;count for oaths you ut&shy;tered with&shy;out thought, but for the in&shy;ten&shy;tion of your hearts. He is most for&shy;giv&shy;ing and for&shy;bear&shy;ing.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:238</sup>&#8239;Strict&shy;ly guard your hab&shy;it of pray&shy;ers. Stand be&shy;fore God in de&shy;vout o&shy;be&shy;di&shy;ence.
    <sup>239</sup>&#8239;If you are in dan&shy;ger, pray walk&shy;ing or rid&shy;ing, but when you are se&shy;cure, re&shy;mem&shy;ber God, for He taught you what you did not know.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:256</sup>&#8239;There shall be no com&shy;pul&shy;sion in re&shy;li&shy;gion. The right path has be&shy;come clear from the wrong. Who&shy;ev&shy;er re&shy;jects false gods and be&shy;lieves in God has grasped the most trust&shy;wor&shy;thy hand&shy;hold that nev&shy;er breaks. God hears and knows all.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:261</sup>&#8239;Those who spend their wealth in God&#x02BC;s cause are like a grain of corn which grows sev&shy;en ears, and each ear has a hun&shy;dred grains. God gives man&shy;i&shy;fold in&shy;crease to whom He wishes.
    <sup>262</sup>&#8239;Those who spend their wealth in God&#x02BC;s cause, and don&#x02BC;t fol&shy;low their gifts with reminders of their gen&shy;er&shy;os&shy;i&shy;ty or with hurt&shy;ful words, will have their re&shy;ward with their Lord: they will have no fear, nor will their grieve.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:263</sup>&#8239;Kind words and for&shy;give&shy;ness are bet&shy;ter than char&shy;i&shy;ty fol&shy;lowed by in&shy;ju&shy;ry. God is self-sufficient, and for&shy;bear&shy;ing.
    <sup>264</sup>&#8239;O you who be&shy;lieve, don&#x02BC;t can&shy;cel your char&shy;i&shy;ty with reminders of your gen&shy;er&shy;os&shy;i&shy;ty or with in&shy;ju&shy;ry, like those who spend their wealth to be seen of men, but do not be&shy;lieve in God or the Last Day. They are like a smooth rock with dust on it. Heav&shy;y rain falls, leav&shy;ing it bare. They are un&shy;a&shy;ble to keep any&shy;thing they have earned. God does not guide dis&shy;be&shy;liev&shy;ers.
    <sup>265</sup>&#8239;Those who spend their sub&shy;stance seek&shy;ing to please God and to strength&shy;en their souls, is like a gar&shy;den, high and fer&shy;tile. Heav&shy;y rain falls on it but makes it yield a dou&shy;ble in&shy;crease of har&shy;vest. If it doesn&#x02BC;t re&shy;ceive heav&shy;y rain, light mois&shy;ture suf&shy;fices. God sees well what&shy;ev&shy;er you do.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:267</sup>&#8239;O ye who be&shy;lieve! Give of the good things which ye have (honourably) earned, and of the fruits of the earth which We have pro&shy;duced for you, and do not e&shy;ven aim at get&shy;ting any&shy;thing which is bad, in or&shy;der that out of it ye may give a&shy;way some&shy;thing, when ye your&shy;selves would not re&shy;ceive it ex&shy;cept with closed eyes.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:268</sup>&#8239;The Evil one threat&shy;ens you with pov&shy;er&shy;ty and bids you to con&shy;duct un&shy;seem&shy;ly. God promiseth you His for&shy;give&shy;ness and bounties. And God careth for all and He knoweth all things.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:270</sup>&#8239;And what&shy;ev&shy;er ye spend in char&shy;i&shy;ty or de&shy;vo&shy;tion, be sure God knows it all. But the wrong-doers have no help&shy;ers.
    <sup>271</sup>&#8239;If ye dis&shy;close (acts of) char&shy;i&shy;ty, e&shy;ven so it is well, but if ye con&shy;ceal them, and make them reach those (really) in need, that is best for you: It will re&shy;move from you some of your (stains of) evil. And God is well ac&shy;quaint&shy;ed with what ye do.
    <sup>272</sup>&#8239;It is not re&shy;quired of thee (O Mes&shy;sen&shy;ger), to set them on the right path, but God sets on the right path whom He pleaseth. What&shy;ev&shy;er of good ye give ben&shy;e&shy;fits your own souls, and ye shall on&shy;ly do so seek&shy;ing the <q>Face</q> of God. What&shy;ev&shy;er good ye give, shall be rend&shy;ered back to you, and ye shall not Be dealt with un&shy;just&shy;ly.
    <sup>273</sup>&#8239;(Charity is) for those in need, who, in God&#x02BC;s cause are re&shy;strict&shy;ed (from trav&shy;el), and can&shy;not move a&shy;bout in the land, seek&shy;ing (For trade or work): the ig&shy;no&shy;rant man thinks, be&shy;cause of their mod&shy;es&shy;ty, that they are free from want. Thou shalt know them by their (Unfailing) mark: They beg not im&shy;por&shy;tu&shy;nate&shy;ly from all the sun&shy;dry. And what&shy;ev&shy;er of good ye give, be as&shy;sured God knoweth it well.
    <sup>274</sup>&#8239;Those who (in char&shy;i&shy;ty) spend of their goods by night and by day, in se&shy;cret and in pub&shy;lic, have their re&shy;ward with their Lord: on them shall be no fear, nor shall they grieve.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:277</sup>&#8239;Those who be&shy;lieve, and do deeds of right&shy;eous&shy;ness, and es&shy;tab&shy;lish reg&shy;u&shy;lar pray&shy;ers and reg&shy;u&shy;lar char&shy;i&shy;ty, will have their re&shy;ward with their Lord: on them shall be no fear, nor shall they grieve.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:282</sup>&#8239;O ye who be&shy;lieve! When ye deal with each oth&shy;er, in trans&shy;ac&shy;tions in&shy;volv&shy;ing fu&shy;ture ob&shy;li&shy;ga&shy;tions in a fixed pe&shy;ri&shy;od of time, re&shy;duce them to writ&shy;ing. Let a scr&shy;ibe write down faith&shy;ful&shy;ly as be&shy;tween the parties: let not the scr&shy;ibe re&shy;fuse to write: as God has taught him, so let him write. Let him who in&shy;curs the li&shy;a&shy;bil&shy;i&shy;ty dic&shy;tate, but let him fear His Lord God, and not di&shy;min&shy;ish aught of what he owes. If the par&shy;ty li&shy;a&shy;ble is men&shy;tal&shy;ly de&shy;fi&shy;cient, or weak, or un&shy;a&shy;ble Him&shy;self to dic&shy;tate, Let his guard&shy;i&shy;an dic&shy;tate faith&shy;ful&shy;ly, and get two witnesses. Dis&shy;dain not to re&shy;duce to writ&shy;ing (your con&shy;tract) for a fu&shy;ture pe&shy;ri&shy;od, wheth&shy;er it be small or big: it is just&shy;er in the sight of God, More suit&shy;a&shy;ble as ev&shy;i&shy;dence, and more con&shy;ven&shy;i&shy;ent to pre&shy;vent doubts a&shy;mong your&shy;selves but if it be a trans&shy;ac&shy;tion which ye car&shy;ry out on the spot a&shy;mong your&shy;selves, there is no blame on you if ye re&shy;duce it not to writ&shy;ing. But take wit&shy;ness when&shy;ev&shy;er ye make a com&shy;mer&shy;cial con&shy;tract; and let nei&shy;ther scr&shy;ibe nor wit&shy;ness suf&shy;fer harm. If ye do (such harm), it would be wick&shy;ed&shy;ness in you. So fear God;  For it is Good that teaches you. And God is well ac&shy;quaint&shy;ed with all things. If ye are on a jour&shy;ney, and can&shy;not find a scr&shy;ibe, a pledge with pos&shy;ses&shy;sion (may serve the pur&shy;pose). And if one of you de&shy;pos&shy;its a thing on trust with an&shy;oth&shy;er, let the trus&shy;tee (faithfully) dis&shy;charge his trust, and let him Fear his Lord con&shy;ceal not ev&shy;i&shy;dence; for who&shy;ev&shy;er con&shy;ceals it, - his heart is tainted with sin. And God knoweth all that ye do.
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>3:3</sup>&#8239;It is He Who sent down to thee (step by step), in truth, the Book, confirming what went be&shy;fore it; and He sent down the Law (of Mo&shy;ses) and the Gos&shy;pel (of Jesus) be&shy;fore this, as a guide to man&shy;kind, and He sent down the cri&shy;te&shy;ri&shy;on (of judg&shy;ment be&shy;tween right and wrong).
</p>

<p>
    <sup>3:14</sup>&#8239;Fair in the eyes of men is the love of things they cov&shy;et: Wom&shy;en and sons; Heaped-up hoards of gold and sil&shy;ver; hors&shy;es branded (for blood and ex&shy;cel&shy;lence); and (wealth of) cat&shy;tle and well-tilled land. Such are the pos&shy;ses&shy;sions of this world&#x02BC;s life; but in near&shy;ness to God is the best of the goals (To re&shy;turn to).
</p>

<p>
    <sup>3:92</sup>&#8239;By no means shall ye at&shy;tain right&shy;eous&shy;ness un&shy;less ye give (freely) of that which ye love; and what&shy;ev&shy;er ye give, of a truth God knoweth it well.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>3:137</sup>&#8239;Man&shy;y were the Ways of Life that have passed a&shy;way be&shy;fore you: trav&shy;el through the earth, and see what was the end of those who re&shy;jected Truth.
    <sup>138</sup>&#8239;Here is a plain state&shy;ment to men, a guid&shy;ance and in&shy;struc&shy;tion to those who fear God!
    <sup>139</sup>&#8239;So lose not heart, nor fall in&shy;to de&shy;spair: For ye must gain mas&shy;ter&shy;y if ye are true in Faith.
    <sup>140</sup>&#8239;Such days (of var&shy;y&shy;ing for&shy;tunes) We give to men and men by turns: that God may know those that be&shy;lieve, and that He may take to Him&shy;self from your ranks Mar&shy;tyr-witnesses (to Truth). And God loveth not those that do wrong.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>3:156</sup>&#8239;O ye who be&shy;lieve! Be not like the Un&shy;be&shy;liev&shy;ers, who say of their breth&shy;ren, when they are trav&shy;el&shy;ling through the Earth or en&shy;gaged in fight&shy;ing: <q>If they had stayed with us, they would not have died, or been slain.</q> This that God may make it a cause of sighs and re&shy;grets in their hearts. It is God that gives Life and Death, and God sees well all that ye do.

    <sup>3:159</sup>&#8239;It is part of the Mer&shy;cy of God that thou dost deal gen&shy;tly with them. Wert thou se&shy;vere or harsh-hearted, they would have bro&shy;ken a&shy;way from a&shy;bout thee: so pass o&shy;ver (Their faults), and ask for (God&#x02BC;s) for&shy;give&shy;ness for them; and con&shy;sult them in af&shy;fairs (of mo&shy;ment). Then, when thou hast Tak&shy;en a de&shy;ci&shy;sion put thy trust in God. For God loves those who put their trust (in Him).

    <sup>4:2</sup>&#8239;To or&shy;phans re&shy;store their prop&shy;er&shy;ty (When they reach their age), nor sub&shy;sti&shy;tute (your) worth&shy;less things for (their) good ones; and de&shy;vour not their sub&shy;stance (by mix&shy;ing it up) with your own. For this is in&shy;deed a great sin.
    <sup>3</sup>&#8239;If ye fear that ye shall not be a&shy;ble to deal just&shy;ly with the or&shy;phans, Mar&shy;ry wom&shy;en of your choice, Two or three or four; but if ye fear that ye shall not be a&shy;ble to deal just&shy;ly (with them), then on&shy;ly one, or (a cap&shy;tive) that your right hands pos&shy;sess, that will be more suit&shy;a&shy;ble, to pre&shy;vent you from do&shy;ing in&shy;jus&shy;tice.
    <sup>4</sup>&#8239;And give the wom&shy;en (on mar&shy;riage) their dow&shy;er as a free gift; but if they, of their own good pleas&shy;ure, re&shy;mit any part of it to you, Take it and en&shy;joy it with right good cheer.
    <sup>5</sup>&#8239;To those weak of un&shy;der&shy;stand&shy;ing Make not o&shy;ver your prop&shy;er&shy;ty, which God hath made a means of sup&shy;port for you, but feed and clothe them there&shy;with, and speak to them words of kind&shy;ness and jus&shy;tice.
    <sup>6</sup>&#8239;Make tri&shy;al of or&shy;phans un&shy;til they reach the age of mar&shy;riage; if then ye find sound judg&shy;ment in them, re&shy;lease their prop&shy;er&shy;ty to them;  but con&shy;sume it not wastefully, nor in haste a&shy;gainst their grow&shy;ing up. If the guard&shy;i&shy;an is well-off, Let him claim no re&shy;mu&shy;ner&shy;a&shy;tion, but if he is poor, let him have for him&shy;self what is just and rea&shy;son&shy;a&shy;ble. When ye re&shy;lease their prop&shy;er&shy;ty to them, take witnesses in their pres&shy;ence:  But all-sufficient is God in tak&shy;ing ac&shy;count.
    <sup>7</sup>&#8239;From what is left by par&shy;ents and those nearest re&shy;lat&shy;ed there is a share for men and a share for wom&shy;en, wheth&shy;er the prop&shy;er&shy;ty be small or large,-a de&shy;ter&shy;mi&shy;nate share.
    <sup>8</sup>&#8239;But if at the time of di&shy;vi&shy;sion oth&shy;er rel&shy;a&shy;tives, or or&shy;phans or poor, are pre&shy;sent, feed them out of the (property), and speak to them words of kind&shy;ness and jus&shy;tice.
    <sup>9</sup>&#8239;Let those (disposing of an es&shy;tate) have the same fear in their minds as they would have for their own if they had left a help&shy;less fam&shy;i&shy;ly be&shy;hind: Let them fear God, and speak words of ap&shy;pro&shy;pri&shy;ate (comfort).

    <sup>19</sup>&#8239;O ye who be&shy;lieve! Ye are for&shy;bid&shy;den to in&shy;her&shy;it wom&shy;en a&shy;gainst their will. Nor should ye treat them with harsh&shy;ness, that ye may Take a&shy;way part of the dow&shy;er ye have giv&shy;en them,-except where they have been guilt&shy;y of o&shy;pen lewd&shy;ness; on the con&shy;tra&shy;ry live with them on a foot&shy;ing of kind&shy;ness and eq&shy;ui&shy;ty.

    <sup>30</sup>&#8239;If any do that in ran&shy;cour and in&shy;jus&shy;tice,- soon shall We cast them in&shy;to the Fire: And eas&shy;y it is for God.
    <sup>31</sup>&#8239;If ye (but) es&shy;chew the most hei&shy;nous of the things which ye are for&shy;bid&shy;den to do, We shall ex&shy;pel out of you all the evil in you, and ad&shy;mit you to a gate of great honour.
    <sup>32</sup>&#8239;And in no wise cov&shy;et those things in which God Hath be&shy;stowed His gifts More free&shy;ly on some of you than on oth&shy;ers: To men is al&shy;lot&shy;ted what they earn, and to wom&shy;en what they earn: But ask God of His boun&shy;ty.

<p>
    <sup>4:34</sup>&#8239;Men are the pro&shy;tec&shy;tors and main&shy;tain&shy;ers of wom&shy;en, be&shy;cause God has giv&shy;en the one more (strength) than the oth&shy;er, and be&shy;cause they sup&shy;port them from their means.

Un&shy;to all (in Faith) Hath God prom&shy;ised good: But those who strive and fight Hath He dis&shy;tin&shy;guished a&shy;bove those who sit (at home) by a spe&shy;cial re&shy;ward,-

<p>
    <sup>4:110</sup>&#8239;If any one does evil or wrongs his own soul but af&shy;ter&shy;wards seeks God&#x02BC;s for&shy;give&shy;ness, he will find God Oft-forgiving, Most Mer&shy;ci&shy;ful.

    <sup>4:123</sup>&#8239;Who&shy;ev&shy;er works evil, will be re&shy;quit&shy;ed ac&shy;cord&shy;ing&shy;ly. Nor will he find, be&shy;sides God, any pro&shy;tec&shy;tor or help&shy;er.
    <sup>124</sup>&#8239;If any do deeds of right&shy;eous&shy;ness,- be they male or fe&shy;male - and have faith, they will en&shy;ter Heav&shy;en, and not the least in&shy;jus&shy;tice will be done to them.

    <sup>4:128</sup>&#8239;If a wife fears cru&shy;el&shy;ty or de&shy;ser&shy;tion on her hus&shy;band&#x02BC;s part, there is no blame on them if they ar&shy;range an am&shy;i&shy;ca&shy;ble set&shy;tle&shy;ment be&shy;tween them&shy;selves; and such set&shy;tle&shy;ment is best; e&shy;ven though men&#x02BC;s souls are swayed by greed.

    <sup>30:33</sup>&#8239;When trou&shy;ble touches men, they cry to their Lord, turn&shy;ing back to Him in re&shy;pent&shy;ance: but when He gives them a taste of Mer&shy;cy as from Him&shy;self, be&shy;hold, some of them pay part-worship to oth&shy;er gods be&shy;sides their Lord,-
    <sup>34</sup>&#8239;(As if) to show their in&shy;grat&shy;i&shy;tude for the (favours) We have be&shy;stowed on them! Then en&shy;joy (your brief day); but soon will ye know (your fol&shy;ly).

<p>
    <sup>30:36</sup>&#8239;When We give men a taste of Mer&shy;cy, they ex&shy;ult there&shy;at: and when some evil af&shy;flicts them be&shy;cause of what their (own) hands have sent forth, be&shy;hold, they are in de&shy;spair!
</p>

<p>
    <sup>30:38</sup>&#8239;So give what is due to kin&shy;dred, the needy, and the way&shy;far&shy;er. That is best for those who seek the Coun&shy;te&shy;nance, of God, and it is they who will pros&shy;per.
    <sup>39</sup>&#8239;That which ye lay out for in&shy;crease through the prop&shy;er&shy;ty of (other) peo&shy;ple, will have no in&shy;crease with God: but that which ye lay out for char&shy;i&shy;ty, seek&shy;ing the Coun&shy;te&shy;nance of God, (will in&shy;crease): it is these who will get a rec&shy;om&shy;pense mul&shy;ti&shy;plied.

    <sup>18</sup>&#8239;Those who spend their wealth for in&shy;crease in self-purification,
    <sup>19</sup>&#8239;And have in their minds no fa&shy;vour from any&shy;one for which a re&shy;ward is ex&shy;pected in re&shy;turn,
    <sup>20</sup>&#8239;But on&shy;ly the de&shy;sire to seek for the Coun&shy;te&shy;nance of their Lord Most High;
    <sup>21</sup>&#8239;And soon will they at&shy;tain (complete) sat&shy;is&shy;fac&shy;tion.

    <sup>93:6</sup>&#8239;Did He not find thee an or&shy;phan and give thee shel&shy;ter (and care)?
    <sup>7</sup>&#8239;And He found thee wan&shy;der&shy;ing, and He gave thee guid&shy;ance.
    <sup>8</sup>&#8239;And He found thee in need, and made thee in&shy;de&shy;pend&shy;ent.
    <sup>9</sup>&#8239;There&shy;fore, treat not the or&shy;phan with harsh&shy;ness,
    <sup>10</sup>&#8239;Nor re&shy;pulse the pe&shy;ti&shy;tion&shy;er (unheard);
    <sup>11</sup>&#8239;But the boun&shy;ty of the Lord - re&shy;hearse and pro&shy;claim!
</p>

<p>
    <sup>94:5</sup>&#8239;So, ver&shy;i&shy;ly, with eve&shy;ry dif&shy;fi&shy;cul&shy;ty, there is re&shy;lief:

    <sup>96:3</sup>&#8239;Pro&shy;claim! And thy Lord is Most Boun&shy;ti&shy;ful,-

    <sup>5</sup>&#8239;Taught man that which he knew not.
    <sup>6</sup>&#8239;Nay, but man doth trans&shy;gress all bounds,

<p>
    <sup>104:1</sup>&#8239;Woe to eve&shy;ry (kind of) scan&shy;dal-monger and-backbiter,
    <sup>2</sup>&#8239;Who pileth up wealth and layeth it by,
    <sup>3</sup>&#8239;Think&shy;ing that his wealth would make him last for ev&shy;er!

<p>
    <sup>107:1</sup>&#8239;Seest thou one who denies the Judg&shy;ment (to come)?
    <sup>2</sup>&#8239;Then such is the (man) who re&shy;pulses the or&shy;phan (with harsh&shy;ness),
    <sup>3</sup>&#8239;And en&shy;cour&shy;ages not the feed&shy;ing of the in&shy;di&shy;gent.
    <sup>4</sup>&#8239;So woe to the worshippers
    <sup>5</sup>&#8239;Who are ne&shy;glect&shy;ful of their pray&shy;ers,
    <sup>6</sup>&#8239;Those who (want but) to be seen (of men),
