    <p>
    <sup>1:1</sup>&#8239;In the name of God, Most Gra&shy;cious, Most Mer&shy;ci&shy;ful.
    <sup>2</sup>&#8239;All praise is owed to God, sus&shy;tain&shy;er of the worlds,
    <sup>4</sup>&#8239;Mas&shy;ter of the Day of Judg&shy;ment.
    <sup>5</sup>&#8239;You a&shy;lone we wor&shy;ship, and you a&shy;lone we ask for help.
    <sup>6</sup>&#8239;Guide us to the straight path.
    <sup>7</sup>&#8239;The path of those you have bless&shy;ed, not of those who earned your an&shy;ger, nor of those who stray.
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>2:2</sup>&#8239;This book, a&shy;bout which there is no doubt, is a guid&shy;ance for those con&shy;scious of God,
    <sup>3</sup>&#8239;who be&shy;lieve in the un&shy;seen, are stead&shy;fast in pray&shy;er, give out of what We have pro&shy;vid&shy;ed for them,
    <sup>4</sup>&#8239;and who be&shy;lieve in the rev&shy;e&shy;la&shy;tion sent to you, [Muhammad], and what was sent be&shy;fore your time, and who have firm faith in the here&shy;af&shy;ter.
    <sup>5</sup>&#8239;They are fol&shy;low&shy;ing guid&shy;ance from their Lord, and it is they who will pros&shy;per.
    <sup>6</sup>&#8239;As to those who dis&shy;be&shy;lieve, it is the same to them wheth&shy;er you warn them or not: they won&#x02BC;t be&shy;lieve.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:42</sup>&#8239;Do not mix truth with false&shy;hood, nor know&shy;ing&shy;ly con&shy;ceal the truth.
    <sup>43</sup>&#8239;Be stead&shy;fast in pray&shy;er, spend in char&shy;i&shy;ty, and bow down with those who bow down in wor&shy;ship.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:44</sup>&#8239;Do you en&shy;join right&shy;eous&shy;ness on the peo&shy;ple, and for&shy;get to do it your&shy;selves, e&shy;ven though you re&shy;cite the Scrip&shy;ture? Have you no sense?
    <sup>45</sup>&#8239;Seek help with pa&shy;tience and pray&shy;er. It is dif&shy;fi&shy;cult in&shy;deed, ex&shy;cept for the hum&shy;ble,
    <sup>46</sup>&#8239;who are cer&shy;tain that they will meet their Lord and re&shy;turn to Him.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:62</sup>&#8239;All who be&shy;lieve in God and the Last Day, and do right&shy;eous&shy;ness, will have their re&shy;ward with their Lord. They will have no fear, nor will they grieve.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:79</sup>&#8239;Woe to those who write a book with their own hands then say, <q>This is from God,</q> in or&shy;der to sell it for a small price!
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:83</sup>&#8239;Re&shy;mem&shy;ber that We took a cov&shy;e&shy;nant from the Chil&shy;dren of Israel: <q>Wor&shy;ship none but God. Do good to your par&shy;ents and rel&shy;a&shy;tives, to or&shy;phans and the poor; speak good words to peo&shy;ple; be stead&shy;fast in pray&shy;er; and spend in char&shy;i&shy;ty.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:111</sup>&#8239;They say, <q>None will en&shy;ter Par&shy;a&shy;dise un&shy;less he is a Jew or a Christian.</q>
    <sup>112</sup>&#8239;In fact, who&shy;ev&shy;er sub&shy;mits him&shy;self whol&shy;ly to God and does good will have his re&shy;ward with his Lord. They will have no fear, nor will they grieve.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:135</sup>&#8239;They say, <q>Be&shy;come Jews or Christians, then you will be right&shy;ly guid&shy;ed.</q> Say, <q>No, we fol&shy;low the re&shy;li&shy;gion of Abraham, who wor&shy;shipped no god be&shy;sides God.</q>
    <sup>136</sup>&#8239;Say, <q>We be&shy;lieve in God, and the rev&shy;e&shy;la&shy;tion giv&shy;en to us, and to Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob, and their de&shy;scend&shy;ants, and the rev&shy;e&shy;la&shy;tion giv&shy;en to Mo&shy;ses, Jesus, and the proph&shy;ets from their Lord.  We make no dis&shy;tinc&shy;tion be&shy;tween any of them, and we sub&shy;mit to Him.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:153</sup>&#8239;Be&shy;liev&shy;ers, seek help through pa&shy;tience and pray&shy;er. For God is with the stead&shy;fast.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:172</sup>&#8239;Be&shy;liev&shy;ers, eat the good things We have pro&shy;vid&shy;ed for you, and be grate&shy;ful to God, if it is Him you wor&shy;ship.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:177</sup>&#8239;Right&shy;eous&shy;ness is not turn&shy;ing your faces to&shy;wards East or West, but right&shy;eous&shy;ness is one who be&shy;lieves in God, the Last Day, the an&shy;gels, the Book, and the proph&shy;ets; who gives of his wealth, e&shy;ven though he loves it, to rel&shy;a&shy;tives, or&shy;phans, the needy, the trav&shy;el&shy;er, beg&shy;gars, and for free&shy;ing slaves; who are stead&shy;fast in pray&shy;er, and spend in char&shy;i&shy;ty; who keep their prom&shy;ises; and are pa&shy;tient in pov&shy;er&shy;ty, ad&shy;ver&shy;si&shy;ty, and dur&shy;ing bat&shy;tle. These ones are true, and con&shy;scious of God.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:180</sup>&#8239;When death approaches any of you and he leaves be&shy;hind wealth, it is pre&shy;scribed that he make a prop&shy;er be&shy;quest to par&shy;ents and near rel&shy;a&shy;tives. This is a du&shy;ty for those con&shy;scious of God.
    <sup>181</sup>&#8239;If any&shy;one al&shy;ters the be&shy;quest af&shy;ter hear&shy;ing it, the sin is on them: God hears and knows all.
    <sup>182</sup>&#8239;But if any&shy;one fears that the tes&shy;ta&shy;tor made a mis&shy;take or did wrong, and makes peace be&shy;tween the heirs, he in&shy;curs no sin: God is for&shy;giv&shy;ing and mer&shy;ci&shy;ful.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:183</sup>&#8239;Be&shy;liev&shy;ers, fasting is pre&shy;scribed for you, as it was for those be&shy;fore you, that you may be&shy;come con&shy;scious of God.
    <sup>184</sup>&#8239;Fast for a spe&shy;cif&shy;ic num&shy;ber of days, but if you are sick or trav&shy;el&shy;ing, make up the days lat&shy;er. Those who can on&shy;ly fast with dif&shy;fi&shy;cul&shy;ty may feed a poor per&shy;son in&shy;stead. Who&shy;ev&shy;er vol&shy;un&shy;teers to give more, it is bet&shy;ter for him. Fasting is bet&shy;ter for you, if you on&shy;ly knew.
    <sup>185</sup>&#8239;In the month of Ramadan the Qur'an was re&shy;vealed as a guid&shy;ance for man&shy;kind, as a clear sign of that guid&shy;ance, and as judg&shy;ment be&shy;tween right and wrong. So who&shy;ev&shy;er is pre&shy;sent dur&shy;ing that month should fast. God wants ease for you, not hard&shy;ship; and per&shy;haps you will be grate&shy;ful.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:188</sup>&#8239;Don&#x02BC;t con&shy;sume one an&shy;oth&shy;er&#x02BC;s prop&shy;er&shy;ty un&shy;just&shy;ly, nor use it to bribe judges, intending to con&shy;sume some of the prop&shy;er&shy;ty of oth&shy;ers sin&shy;ful&shy;ly and know&shy;ing&shy;ly.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:215</sup>&#8239;They ask you what they should spend in char&shy;i&shy;ty. Say, <q>What&shy;ev&shy;er you spend should be for par&shy;ents, close rel&shy;a&shy;tives, or&shy;phans, the poor, and for trav&shy;el&shy;ers.  What&shy;ev&shy;er good you do, God knows it well.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:216</sup>&#8239;You may dis&shy;like some&shy;thing that&#x02BC;s good for you, and love some&shy;thing that&#x02BC;s bad for you. God knows, and you do not.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:219</sup>&#8239;They ask you a&shy;bout wine and gambling. Say, <q>In them is great sin, yet some ben&shy;e&shy;fit, but the sin is greater than the ben&shy;e&shy;fit.</q> They ask you how much they should give. Say, <q>The ex&shy;cess.</q>
    <sup>220</sup>&#8239;They ask you a&shy;bout or&shy;phans. Say, <q>Im&shy;prov&shy;ing their con&shy;di&shy;tion is best. If you mix their af&shy;fairs with yours, they are your broth&shy;ers. God knows who spoils things and who im&shy;proves them. If God had wished, He could have put you in&shy;to difficul&shy;ties.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:221</sup>&#8239;Don&#x02BC;t mar&shy;ry i&shy;dol&shy;a&shy;trous wom&shy;en un&shy;til they be&shy;lieve. A slave who be&shy;lieves is bet&shy;ter than an i&shy;dol&shy;a&shy;tress, e&shy;ven if she pleases you. Don&#x02BC;t mar&shy;ry your daugh&shy;ters to i&shy;dol&shy;a&shy;trous men un&shy;til they be&shy;lieve. A slave who be&shy;lieves is bet&shy;ter than an i&shy;dol&shy;a&shy;ter, e&shy;ven if he pleases you. These in&shy;vite you to the fire.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:225</sup>&#8239;God will not call you to ac&shy;count for oaths you ut&shy;tered with&shy;out thought, but for the in&shy;ten&shy;tion of your hearts. He is most for&shy;giv&shy;ing and for&shy;bear&shy;ing.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:238</sup>&#8239;Strict&shy;ly guard your hab&shy;it of pray&shy;ers. Stand be&shy;fore God in de&shy;vout o&shy;be&shy;di&shy;ence.
    <sup>239</sup>&#8239;If you are in dan&shy;ger, pray walk&shy;ing or rid&shy;ing, but when you are se&shy;cure, re&shy;mem&shy;ber God, for He taught you what you did not know.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:256</sup>&#8239;There shall be no com&shy;pul&shy;sion in re&shy;li&shy;gion. The right path has be&shy;come clear from the wrong. Who&shy;ev&shy;er re&shy;jects false gods and be&shy;lieves in God has grasped the most trust&shy;wor&shy;thy hand&shy;hold that nev&shy;er breaks. God hears and knows all.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:261</sup>&#8239;Those who spend their wealth in God&#x02BC;s cause are like a grain of corn which grows sev&shy;en ears, and each ear has a hun&shy;dred grains. God gives man&shy;i&shy;fold in&shy;crease to whom He wishes.
    <sup>262</sup>&#8239;Those who spend their wealth in God&#x02BC;s cause, and don&#x02BC;t fol&shy;low their gifts with reminders of their gen&shy;er&shy;os&shy;i&shy;ty or with hurt&shy;ful words, will have their re&shy;ward with their Lord: they will have no fear, nor will their grieve.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:263</sup>&#8239;Kind words and for&shy;give&shy;ness are bet&shy;ter than char&shy;i&shy;ty fol&shy;lowed by in&shy;ju&shy;ry. God is self-sufficient, and for&shy;bear&shy;ing.
    <sup>264</sup>&#8239;Be&shy;liev&shy;ers, don&#x02BC;t can&shy;cel your char&shy;i&shy;ty with reminders of your gen&shy;er&shy;os&shy;i&shy;ty or with in&shy;ju&shy;ry, like those who spend their wealth to be seen of men, but do not be&shy;lieve in God or the Last Day. They are like a smooth rock with dust on it. Heav&shy;y rain falls, leav&shy;ing it bare. They are un&shy;a&shy;ble to keep any&shy;thing they have earned. God does not guide dis&shy;be&shy;liev&shy;ers.
    <sup>265</sup>&#8239;Those who spend their wealth seek&shy;ing to please God are like a gar&shy;den on high ground. Heav&shy;y rain falls, yield&shy;ing a dou&shy;ble har&shy;vest. If heav&shy;y rain doesn&#x02BC;t fall, light rain will. God sees all that you do.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:267</sup>&#8239;Be&shy;liev&shy;ers, give from the good things which you have earned, and from what We have pro&shy;duced for you from the earth. Do not give from what is bad, when you your&shy;selves would on&shy;ly ac&shy;cept it if your eyes were closed.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:268</sup>&#8239;Satan threat&shy;ens you with pov&shy;er&shy;ty and or&shy;ders you to com&shy;mit im&shy;mo&shy;ral&shy;i&shy;ty. God prom&shy;ises you His for&shy;give&shy;ness and boun&shy;ty.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:270</sup>&#8239;What&shy;ev&shy;er you give, or vow to give, God knows it. But the wrong&shy;do&shy;ers will have no help&shy;ers.
    <sup>271</sup>&#8239;If you dis&shy;close your char&shy;i&shy;ty, it is good, but if you con&shy;ceal it and give it to the poor, it is bet&shy;ter for you. It will a&shy;tone for some of your bad deeds. God is a&shy;ware of what you do.
    <sup>272</sup>&#8239;What&shy;ev&shy;er char&shy;i&shy;ty you give ben&shy;e&shy;fits your own soul when you do it on&shy;ly to seek the face of God. What&shy;ev&shy;er you give will be repaid to you in full, and you will not be wronged.
    <sup>273</sup>&#8239;Give to the poor who are whol&shy;ly occupied in God&#x02BC;s cause, un&shy;a&shy;ble to trav&shy;el in the land for work. The un&shy;know&shy;ing might think they are rich be&shy;cause of their re&shy;straint, but you will rec&shy;og&shy;nize them be&shy;cause they don&#x02BC;t beg per&shy;sist&shy;ent&shy;ly. What&shy;ev&shy;er good you give, be as&shy;sured that God knows it.
    <sup>274</sup>&#8239;Those who give of their pos&shy;ses&shy;sions by night and by day, pri&shy;vate&shy;ly and pub&shy;lic&shy;ly, will have their re&shy;ward with their Lord: they will have no fear, nor will they grieve.
    <sup>277</sup>&#8239;Those who be&shy;lieve, do good works, are stead&shy;fast in pray&shy;er, and spend in char&shy;i&shy;ty, will have their re&shy;ward with their Lord:  they will have no fear, nor will they grieve.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:282</sup>&#8239;When you con&shy;tract a debt for a spec&shy;i&shy;fied term, write it down. Let the debt&shy;or write, and not di&shy;min&shy;ish what he owes, but if the debt&shy;or is men&shy;tal&shy;ly de&shy;fi&shy;cient, or weak, or un&shy;a&shy;ble to write, let his guard&shy;i&shy;an write just&shy;ly. Bring two witnesses. They must not re&shy;fuse when called to tes&shy;ti&shy;fy. Do not dis&shy;dain to write down your con&shy;tract, wheth&shy;er it be small or large, a&shy;long with the time it falls due: this is more just with God, more re&shy;li&shy;a&shy;ble as ev&shy;i&shy;dence, and more like&shy;ly to pre&shy;vent doubt be&shy;tween you. If it be an im&shy;me&shy;di&shy;ate trade, there is no blame if you don&#x02BC;t write it down. Have witnesses pre&shy;sent when you trade with one an&shy;oth&shy;er.
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>3:3</sup>&#8239;He sent down to you the Book with the truth, confirming what went be&shy;fore it. He sent down the Torah and the Gos&shy;pel
    <sup>4</sup>&#8239;ear&shy;li&shy;er as a guid&shy;ance for the peo&shy;ple.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>3:14</sup>&#8239;Al&shy;lur&shy;ing to men is the love of their de&shy;sires: wom&shy;en, chil&shy;dren, heap&shy;ing treas&shy;ures of gold and sil&shy;ver, fi&shy;ne hors&shy;es, cat&shy;tle, and farm&shy;land. These are pleas&shy;ures of life in this world, but with God is the best place to re&shy;turn.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>3:92</sup>&#8239;You will on&shy;ly at&shy;tain true pi&shy;e&shy;ty if you give out of what you love. What&shy;ev&shy;er you give, tru&shy;ly, God knows it.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>3:137</sup>&#8239;Sit&shy;u&shy;a&shy;tions sim&shy;i&shy;lar to yours have hap&shy;pened be&shy;fore: trav&shy;el through the earth, and see how it ended for the dis&shy;be&shy;liev&shy;ers.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>3:139</sup>&#8239;Do not weak&shy;en, or de&shy;spair: for if you are true be&shy;liev&shy;ers, you will have the ad&shy;van&shy;tage.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>3:156</sup>&#8239;Be&shy;liev&shy;ers, don&#x02BC;t say of your broth&shy;ers who trav&shy;eled or went out to fight, <q>If they had stayed with us, they would not have died.</q> This will be&shy;come a source of re&shy;gret in your hearts.
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>4:2</sup>&#8239;Give or&shy;phans their prop&shy;er&shy;ty. Don&#x02BC;t re&shy;place their good things with your bad things, nor con&shy;sume their prop&shy;er&shy;ty to&shy;geth&shy;er with your own. Sure&shy;ly, this is a great sin.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>4:3</sup>&#8239;Mar&shy;ry wom&shy;en of your choice, two or three or four. If you fear that you will not treat them fair&shy;ly, then on&shy;ly one. That will help you a&shy;void bi&shy;as.
    <sup>4</sup>&#8239;Give the wom&shy;en their dow&shy;er gra&shy;cious&shy;ly. If they will&shy;ing&shy;ly re&shy;mit any of it to you, en&shy;joy it with a clear con&shy;science.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>4:5</sup>&#8239;Do not en&shy;trust your prop&shy;er&shy;ty to the weak-minded. God made it a means of sup&shy;port for you, but feed and clothe them with it, and speak to them with kind&shy;ness.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>4:6</sup>&#8239;Test or&shy;phans un&shy;til they reach mar&shy;riage&shy;a&shy;ble age. If they have sound judg&shy;ment, re&shy;lease their prop&shy;er&shy;ty to them. Don&#x02BC;t con&shy;sume it wastefully or hast&shy;i&shy;ly be&shy;fore they grow up. If the guard&shy;i&shy;an is wealth&shy;y, he should take no com&shy;pen&shy;sa&shy;tion. If he is poor, he should use on&shy;ly what is rea&shy;son&shy;a&shy;ble. When you re&shy;lease their prop&shy;er&shy;ty to them, bring witnesses.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>4:7</sup>&#8239;Men and wom&shy;en shall each have a share of what par&shy;ents and close rel&shy;a&shy;tives leave, wheth&shy;er the prop&shy;er&shy;ty is small or large: an ob&shy;lig&shy;a&shy;to&shy;ry share.
    <sup>8</sup>&#8239;If oth&shy;er rel&shy;a&shy;tives, or or&shy;phans, or poor are pre&shy;sent dur&shy;ing the di&shy;vi&shy;sion, then give them some&shy;thing from the es&shy;tate, and speak to them with kind&shy;ness.
    <sup>9</sup>&#8239;Let ex&shy;ec&shy;u&shy;tors have the same fear in their minds as if they had left help&shy;less chil&shy;dren be&shy;hind. Let them fear God, and speak just&shy;ly.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>4:18</sup>&#8239;Re&shy;pent&shy;ance has no ef&shy;fect for those who con&shy;tin&shy;ue to do evil un&shy;til death con&shy;fronts them and they say, <q>Now I re&shy;pent.</q>

<p>
    <sup>4:19</sup>&#8239;Be&shy;liev&shy;ers, you are for&shy;bid&shy;den to in&shy;her&shy;it wom&shy;en a&shy;gainst their will. Don&#x02BC;t treat your wives harsh&shy;ly, hop&shy;ing to take back part of the dow&shy;er you gave them. Live with them in kind&shy;ness. If you dis&shy;like them, it may be that you dis&shy;like some&shy;thing in which God has placed much good.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>4:22</sup>&#8239;Don&#x02BC;t mar&shy;ry wom&shy;en whom your fa&shy;thers mar&shy;ried,
    <sup>23</sup>&#8239;wom&shy;en who share 25 per&shy;cent or more of your DNA, your wet nurses, your milk sis&shy;ters, your wives&#x02BC; moth&shy;ers, your step&shy;daugh&shy;ters, those who have been your sons&#x02BC; wives, two sis&shy;ters at the same time,
    <sup>24</sup>&#8239;and wom&shy;en al&shy;read&shy;y mar&shy;ried. All oth&shy;er wom&shy;en are law&shy;ful to you, pro&shy;vid&shy;ed that you seek them in mar&shy;riage, with dow&shy;er from your prop&shy;er&shy;ty, de&shy;sir&shy;ing mar&shy;riage not for&shy;ni&shy;ca&shy;tion.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>4:29</sup>&#8239;Be&shy;liev&shy;ers, don&#x02BC;t con&shy;sume one an&shy;oth&shy;er&#x02BC;s wealth un&shy;just&shy;ly, but let there be trade by mu&shy;tu&shy;al con&shy;sent. Don&#x02BC;t kill your&shy;selves or one an&shy;oth&shy;er, for God is mer&shy;ci&shy;ful to you.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>4:31</sup>&#8239;If you a&shy;void the great sins which you are for&shy;bid&shy;den, We will re&shy;move your mi&shy;nor sins, and ad&shy;mit you through the en&shy;trance of hon&shy;or.
    <sup>32</sup>&#8239;Don&#x02BC;t cov&shy;et what God has be&shy;stowed more free&shy;ly on some than on oth&shy;ers. Men and wom&shy;en re&shy;ceive a share of what they earn.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>4:36</sup>&#8239;Wor&shy;ship God, and join noth&shy;ing with Him. Do good to par&shy;ents, rel&shy;a&shy;tives, or&shy;phans, the poor, neigh&shy;bors, the com&shy;pan&shy;ion by your side, and trav&shy;el&shy;ers. God does not like the ar&shy;ro&shy;gant, the boast&shy;ful,
    <sup>37</sup>&#8239;the stin&shy;gy; those who com&shy;mand oth&shy;ers to be stin&shy;gy, hid&shy;ing the boun&shy;ty God has giv&shy;en them;
    <sup>38</sup>&#8239;those who spend their wealth to be seen by men, and don&#x02BC;t be&shy;lieve in God nor the Last Day.
    <sup>39</sup>&#8239;What harm would it do them to be&shy;lieve in God and the Last Day, and to spend out of what God has pro&shy;vid&shy;ed them?
    <sup>40</sup>&#8239;God wrongs no one in the least de&shy;gree. If there is a good deed, He dou&shy;bles it, and gives a great re&shy;ward.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>4:58</sup>&#8239;God com&shy;mands you to re&shy;turn what you&#x02BC;ve been en&shy;trusted to its right&shy;ful own&shy;er. When you judge be&shy;tween peo&shy;ple, do so with jus&shy;tice. God&#x02BC;s in&shy;struc&shy;tions to you are ex&shy;cel&shy;lent. He hears and sees all.
    <sup>59</sup>&#8239;Be&shy;liev&shy;ers, o&shy;bey God, the Mes&shy;sen&shy;ger, and those in au&shy;thor&shy;i&shy;ty a&shy;mong you.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>4:85</sup>&#8239;Who&shy;ev&shy;er in&shy;ter&shy;cedes for a good cause will share in its re&shy;ward. Who&shy;ev&shy;er in&shy;ter&shy;cedes for an evil cause will share in its bur&shy;den.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>4:86</sup>&#8239;When of&shy;fered a greet&shy;ing, re&shy;spond with a bet&shy;ter one, or at least its e&shy;qual. God takes ac&shy;count of eve&shy;ry&shy;thing.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>4:95</sup>&#8239;God pre&shy;fers the be&shy;liev&shy;ers who strive with their wealth and lives o&shy;ver those who sit &mdash; oth&shy;er than the dis&shy;a&shy;bled. Al&shy;though He has prom&shy;ised good to all of them, those who strive re&shy;ceive a greater re&shy;ward than those who sit.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>4:100</sup>&#8239;Who&shy;ev&shy;er em&shy;i&shy;grates for God&#x02BC;s cause will find on the earth a&shy;bun&shy;dance, and man&shy;y places of ref&shy;uge. If he then dies as a ref&shy;u&shy;gee, his re&shy;ward from God is cer&shy;tain.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>4:101</sup>&#8239;When you trav&shy;el, it&#x02BC;s no sin to short&shy;en your pray&shy;ers, if you fear that dis&shy;be&shy;liev&shy;ers may at&shy;tack you.
    <sup>103</sup>&#8239;When you have com&shy;plet&shy;ed the pray&shy;er, re&shy;mem&shy;ber God: stand&shy;ing, sit&shy;ting, and ly&shy;ing down. Once you are se&shy;cure, re-establish reg&shy;u&shy;lar pray&shy;er, for pray&shy;er is man&shy;da&shy;to&shy;ry for be&shy;liev&shy;ers at spe&shy;cif&shy;ic times.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>4:110</sup>&#8239;One who does evil or wrongs him&shy;self, but then asks God for for&shy;give&shy;ness, will find God is for&shy;giv&shy;ing and mer&shy;ci&shy;ful.
    <sup>112</sup>&#8239;But if one sins then blames an in&shy;no&shy;cent per&shy;son, he bur&shy;dens him&shy;self with a slan&shy;der and a fla&shy;grant sin.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>4:123</sup>&#8239;Any&shy;one who does wrong will be re&shy;quit&shy;ed ac&shy;cord&shy;ing&shy;ly and will find no pro&shy;tec&shy;tor or help&shy;er be&shy;sides God.
    <sup>124</sup>&#8239;Any be&shy;liev&shy;er, male or fe&shy;male, who does good deeds will en&shy;ter heav&shy;en, and will not re&shy;ceive the least in&shy;jus&shy;tice.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>4:129</sup>&#8239;You will nev&shy;er be a&shy;ble to treat your wives with per&shy;fect fair&shy;ness, how&shy;ev&shy;er much you may want to, but don&#x02BC;t fa&shy;vor one com&shy;plete&shy;ly so as to leave an&shy;oth&shy;er hang&shy;ing. If you make a&shy;mends and are con&shy;scious of God, He is for&shy;giv&shy;ing and mer&shy;ci&shy;ful.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>4:135</sup>&#8239;Be&shy;liev&shy;ers, stead&shy;fast&shy;ly up&shy;hold jus&shy;tice, as witnesses for God, e&shy;ven if it is a&shy;gainst your&shy;selves, your par&shy;ents, or your rel&shy;a&shy;tives. Wheth&shy;er rich or poor, God can best pro&shy;tect them both. Don&#x02BC;t fol&shy;low your own de&shy;sire, lest you swerve from jus&shy;tice. If you dis&shy;tort or ne&shy;glect jus&shy;tice, God knows well what you do.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>4:140</sup>&#8239;When you hear peo&shy;ple de&shy;ny and rid&shy;i&shy;cule God&#x02BC;s mes&shy;sages, do not sit with them un&shy;til they change top&shy;ics. Oth&shy;er&shy;wise you will be&shy;come like them: God will gath&shy;er the hyp&shy;o&shy;crites and dis&shy;be&shy;liev&shy;ers in hell.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>4:142</sup>&#8239;When hyp&shy;o&shy;crites stand to pray, they stand la&shy;zi&shy;ly, to be seen of men, remembering God on&shy;ly a lit&shy;tle,
    <sup>143</sup>&#8239;wavering be&shy;tween this and that, be&shy;long&shy;ing to nei&shy;ther these nor those.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>4:148</sup>&#8239;God does not like evil to be men&shy;tioned in pub&shy;lic, ex&shy;cept by the one who was wronged. God hears and knows all.
    <sup>149</sup>&#8239;Wheth&shy;er you do good openly or pri&shy;vate&shy;ly, or par&shy;don an evil, God is for&shy;giv&shy;ing and pow&shy;er&shy;ful.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>4:163</sup>&#8239;Muhammad, we&#x02BC;ve sent you rev&shy;e&shy;la&shy;tion as We did to No&shy;ah and the proph&shy;ets af&shy;ter him: Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob, Jesus, Job, Jonah, Aaron, and Solomon; to David We gave the Psalms;
    <sup>164</sup>&#8239;to oth&shy;er mes&shy;sen&shy;gers We&#x02BC;ve men&shy;tioned be&shy;fore; to oth&shy;ers We ha&shy;ven&#x02BC;t men&shy;tioned; and to Mo&shy;ses God spoke di&shy;rect&shy;ly.
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>5:2</sup>&#8239;Some peo&shy;ple shut you out of the Sa&shy;cred Mosque. Don&#x02BC;t let your ha&shy;tred for them lead you to trans&shy;gress. Help one an&shy;oth&shy;er in right&shy;eous&shy;ness and pi&shy;e&shy;ty, but don&#x02BC;t help one an&shy;oth&shy;er in sin and ag&shy;gres&shy;sion. Fear God, for God is se&shy;vere in pun&shy;ish&shy;ment.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>5:7</sup>&#8239;Re&shy;mem&shy;ber God&#x02BC;s bles&shy;sing on you, and His cov&shy;e&shy;nant which bound you when you sa&shy;id, <q>We hear and we o&shy;bey</q>. Fear God, for He knows all the se&shy;crets of your heart.
    <sup>8</sup>&#8239;Be&shy;liev&shy;ers, be stead&shy;fast in de&shy;vo&shy;tion to God, as im&shy;par&shy;tial witnesses. Don&#x02BC;t let ha&shy;tred of oth&shy;ers lead you a&shy;way from jus&shy;tice. Be just: that is nearer to pi&shy;e&shy;ty. Fear God, for He is a&shy;ware of all that you do.
    <sup>9</sup>&#8239;God has prom&shy;ised for&shy;give&shy;ness and a great re&shy;ward to those who be&shy;lieve and do good works.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>5:32</sup>&#8239;If any&shy;one kills a per&shy;son, ex&shy;cept as re&shy;tal&shy;i&shy;a&shy;tion for mur&shy;der, it is as if he kills all man&shy;kind. And if any&shy;one saves a life, it is as if he saves the lives of all man&shy;kind.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>5:35</sup>&#8239;Be&shy;liev&shy;ers, fear God, seek ways to come clos&shy;er to Him, and strive in His cause that you may pros&shy;per.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>5:38</sup>&#8239;Cut off the hands of thieves, male or fe&shy;male, as rec&shy;om&shy;pense for what they have done: a de&shy;ter&shy;rent from God.
    <sup>39</sup>&#8239;But who&shy;ev&shy;er re&shy;pents af&shy;ter his crime, and makes a&shy;mends, God will ac&shy;cept his re&shy;pent&shy;ance, for God is for&shy;giv&shy;ing and mer&shy;ci&shy;ful.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>5:44</sup>&#8239;We re&shy;vealed the Torah containing guid&shy;ance and light.
    <sup>45</sup>&#8239;In it we or&shy;dained a life for a life, an eye for an eye, and sim&shy;i&shy;lar ret&shy;ri&shy;bu&shy;tion for wounds. But if any&shy;one forgoes this out of char&shy;i&shy;ty, it is an a&shy;tone&shy;ment for him&shy;self.  Those who do not judge by what God has re&shy;vealed are the wrong&shy;do&shy;ers.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>5:48</sup>&#8239;Muhammad, We re&shy;vealed to you this Book with the truth, confirming the scrip&shy;tures that came be&shy;fore it.  To each of you, We have pre&shy;scribed a law and a clear path. Had God wanted it, He would have made you all a sin&shy;gle com&shy;mu&shy;ni&shy;ty, but He wanted to test you in what He has giv&shy;en you, so race to do good. You will all re&shy;turn to God, then He will clar&shy;i&shy;fy that on which you used to dif&shy;fer.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>5:57</sup>&#8239;Be&shy;liev&shy;ers, don&#x02BC;t take al&shy;lies who view your re&shy;li&shy;gion with rid&shy;i&shy;cule and a&shy;muse&shy;ment.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>5:89</sup>&#8239;God will not pun&shy;ish you for your thought&shy;less oaths, on&shy;ly for your de&shy;lib&shy;er&shy;ate oaths. The a&shy;tone&shy;ment for break&shy;ing an oath is to feed ten poor peo&shy;ple as you would feed your own fam&shy;i&shy;ly, or to clothe them, or to free a slave. If you can&#x02BC;t af&shy;ford it, fast for three days. That is the a&shy;tone&shy;ment for bro&shy;ken oaths, but keep your oaths.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>5:90</sup>&#8239;Be&shy;liev&shy;ers: in&shy;tox&shy;i&shy;cants, gambling, i&shy;dol&shy;a&shy;try, and div&shy;i&shy;na&shy;tion are a&shy;bom&shy;i&shy;na&shy;tions from Satan. A&shy;void them so that you may pros&shy;per.
    <sup>91</sup>&#8239;Satan on&shy;ly wants to use in&shy;tox&shy;i&shy;cants and gambling to cause en&shy;mi&shy;ty and ha&shy;tred a&shy;mong you, and to hin&shy;der you from remembering God and pray&shy;er. So will you quit?
</p>

<p>
    <sup>5:106</sup>&#8239;Be&shy;liev&shy;ers, when mak&shy;ing be&shy;quests as death approaches you, let there be two hon&shy;est witnesses.

    <sup>6:7</sup>&#8239;Muhammad, e&shy;ven if We had sent down to you a mes&shy;sage writ&shy;ten on pa&shy;per, and the dis&shy;be&shy;liev&shy;ers had tou&shy;ched it with their hands, they would have sa&shy;id, <q>This is noth&shy;ing but ob&shy;vi&shy;ous mag&shy;ic!</q>
    <sup>8</sup>&#8239;They say, <q>Why was no an&shy;gel sent down to him?</q> Had We sent down an an&shy;gel, their judg&shy;ment would have come at once, with&shy;out res&shy;pite.
    <sup>9</sup>&#8239;E&shy;ven if We had sent an an&shy;gel, We would have sent him as a man, adding to their con&shy;fu&shy;sion.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>6:48</sup>&#8239;We send the mes&shy;sen&shy;gers on&shy;ly to give good news and to warn. Who&shy;ev&shy;er be&shy;lieves and re&shy;forms will have no fear, nor will they grieve.
    <sup>49</sup>&#8239;But suf&shy;fer&shy;ing af&shy;flicts those who re&shy;ject our mes&shy;sages, be&shy;cause of their de&shy;fi&shy;ant dis&shy;o&shy;be&shy;di&shy;ence.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>6:52</sup>&#8239;Don&#x02BC;t send a&shy;way those who call on their Lord morn&shy;ing and eve&shy;ning, seek&shy;ing His face. You are not ac&shy;count&shy;a&shy;ble for them, nor they for you. If you turn them a&shy;way, you be&shy;come one of the un&shy;just.
    <sup>54</sup>&#8239;When those who be&shy;lieve in Our mes&shy;sages come to you, say, <q>Peace be up&shy;on you. Your Lord has pre&shy;scribed for Him&shy;self mer&shy;cy: if any of you does wrong out of ig&shy;no&shy;rance, but then re&shy;pents and cor&shy;rects him&shy;self, He is for&shy;giv&shy;ing and mer&shy;ci&shy;ful.</q>
</p>

</p>

<p>
    <sup>6:70</sup>&#8239;Leave a&shy;lone those who take play and a&shy;muse&shy;ment as their re&shy;li&shy;gion, and are de&shy;ceived by the life of this world. Re&shy;mind them, lest a soul be de&shy;stroyed for what it has earned, that it will find no pro&shy;tec&shy;tor or in&shy;ter&shy;ces&shy;sor ex&shy;cept God.

    <sup>9:60</sup>&#8239;Alms are for the poor, the needy, those who ad&shy;min&shy;is&shy;ter the funds, those whose hearts are to be won o&shy;ver, to free slaves, to help debt&shy;ors, for God&#x02BC;s cause, and needy trav&shy;el&shy;ers &mdash; an ob&shy;li&shy;ga&shy;tion from God. God is all know&shy;ing and wise.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>9:71</sup>&#8239;The be&shy;liev&shy;ers, men and wom&shy;en, pro&shy;tect one an&shy;oth&shy;er. They en&shy;join what is right, for&shy;bid what is wrong, are stead&shy;fast in pray&shy;er, spend in char&shy;i&shy;ty, and o&shy;bey God and His Mes&shy;sen&shy;ger. God will have mer&shy;cy on them, for God is al&shy;might&shy;y and wise.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>9:91</sup>&#8239;There is no blame on the weak, the ill, or those with&shy;out re&shy;sources to spend, when they are sin&shy;cere to God and His Mes&shy;sen&shy;ger. There is no rea&shy;son to re&shy;proach those who do good. God is for&shy;giv&shy;ing and mer&shy;ci&shy;ful.
    <sup>92</sup>&#8239;There is al&shy;so no blame on those who came to you for mounts, and when you sa&shy;id, <q>I can&#x02BC;t find a mount for you,</q> they turned back, their eyes overflowing with tears of grief that they had noth&shy;ing to spend.
    <sup>93</sup>&#8239;On&shy;ly those who re&shy;quest ex&shy;emp&shy;tion, de&shy;spite be&shy;ing rich, are o&shy;pen to blame. They are con&shy;tent to be with those who stay be&shy;hind.

    <sup>10:11</sup>&#8239;If God were to has&shy;ten the ill that men have earned, as they wish to has&shy;ten the good, their end would al&shy;read&shy;y be here.
    <sup>12</sup>&#8239;And when trou&shy;ble touches man, he cries out to Us wheth&shy;er ly&shy;ing on his side, sit&shy;ting, or stand&shy;ing, but when We re&shy;move his trou&shy;ble, he goes on his way as if he had nev&shy;er cried out to Us.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>10:41</sup>&#8239;If they don&#x02BC;t be&shy;lieve you, say, <q>My deeds for me, and yours for you. You are not re&shy;spon&shy;si&shy;ble for what I do, nor I for what you do.</q>

    <sup>10:47</sup>&#8239;Eve&shy;ry com&shy;mu&shy;ni&shy;ty is sent a mes&shy;sen&shy;ger. When their mes&shy;sen&shy;ger co&shy;mes, they will be judged with jus&shy;tice, and will not be wronged.

    <sup>11:9</sup>&#8239;If We let man taste mer&shy;cy, and then with&shy;draw it, he des&shy;pairs and is un&shy;grate&shy;ful.

    <sup>11</sup>&#8239;Those who are stead&shy;fast and do right&shy;eous deeds don&#x02BC;t act this way. They will have for&shy;give&shy;ness and a great re&shy;ward.

<p>
    <sup>11:84</sup>&#8239;To Midian we sent their broth&shy;er Shu&#x02BC;ayb. He sa&shy;id, <q>My peo&shy;ple, wor&shy;ship God. I see you prospering, but I fear your pun&shy;ish&shy;ment on an all-encompassing day.
    <sup>85</sup>&#8239;Give full meas&shy;ure and weight. Don&#x02BC;t with&shy;hold from peo&shy;ple what is right&shy;ful&shy;ly theirs.</q>
</p>

    <sup>11:112</sup>&#8239;Stay on the right path as you have been com&shy;manded, to&shy;geth&shy;er with those who have turned to God. Don&#x02BC;t trans&shy;gress, for He sees all that you do.
    <sup>113</sup>&#8239;Don&#x02BC;t in&shy;cline to&shy;ward nor re&shy;ly on those who do wrong.
    <sup>114</sup>&#8239;Be stead&shy;fast in pray&shy;er at both ends of the day and dur&shy;ing parts of the night. Good deeds drive a&shy;way evil deeds. That is a reminder for the mind&shy;ful.
    <sup>115</sup>&#8239;Be stead&shy;fast: God won&#x02BC;t lose the re&shy;ward of those who do good.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>11:117</sup>&#8239;Your Lord would nev&shy;er de&shy;stroy communities un&shy;just&shy;ly if its peo&shy;ple act right&shy;eous&shy;ly.
    <sup>118</sup>&#8239;If your Lord had wanted, He could have made man&shy;kind one com&shy;mu&shy;ni&shy;ty, but they con&shy;tin&shy;ue to dif&shy;fer.

    <sup>28</sup>&#8239;those who be&shy;lieve, and those whose hearts find rest in remembering God.

</p>

<p>
    <sup>14:10</sup>&#8239;The mes&shy;sen&shy;gers sa&shy;id to them, <q>Can there be any doubt a&shy;bout God, the cre&shy;a&shy;tor of the heav&shy;ens and earth?

    <sup>11</sup>&#8239;Their mes&shy;sen&shy;gers an&shy;swered, <q>True, we are on&shy;ly men like you, but God fa&shy;vors His serv&shy;ants as He pleases. We can&#x02BC;t bring you proof un&shy;less God per&shy;mits it, so let all be&shy;liev&shy;ers put their trust in God.</q>

<p>
    <sup>15:19</sup>&#8239;We have spread out the earth, placed firm moun&shy;tains on it, and let eve&shy;ry&shy;thing grow on it in due bal&shy;ance.

    <sup>7</sup>&#8239;They car&shy;ry your loads to lands that you could on&shy;ly reach on your own with great hard&shy;ship. Tru&shy;ly your Lord is kind and mer&shy;ci&shy;ful.
    <sup>8</sup>&#8239;He has cre&shy;at&shy;ed hors&shy;es, mules, and don&shy;keys for you to ride, and as a&shy;dorn&shy;ment. He al&shy;so cre&shy;ates things you know noth&shy;ing a&shy;bout.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>16:10</sup>&#8239;He sends down wa&shy;ter from the sky. It pro&shy;vides a drink for you and for the veg&shy;e&shy;ta&shy;tion which feeds your live&shy;stock.

<p>
    <sup>16:14</sup>&#8239;He has sub&shy;jected the sea for you, that you may eat fresh meat from it, and ex&shy;tract or&shy;na&shy;ments from it to wear. You see the ships plowing through its waves seek&shy;ing the boun&shy;ty of God that you may be grate&shy;ful.
    <sup>15</sup>&#8239;He has placed riv&shy;ers and roads on the earth, so you may find your way;

<p>
    <sup>16:36</sup>&#8239;We sent a mes&shy;sen&shy;ger to eve&shy;ry com&shy;mu&shy;ni&shy;ty say&shy;ing, <q>Serve God and a&shy;void false gods.</q> A&shy;mong them were some whom God guid&shy;ed and some who strayed.

<p>
    <sup>16:61</sup>&#8239;If God were to pun&shy;ish men for their wrong&shy;do&shy;ing, He would leave no liv&shy;ing crea&shy;ture on the earth, but He gives them res&shy;pite for an ap&shy;point&shy;ed time.

    <sup>91</sup>&#8239;Ful&shy;fill the cov&shy;e&shy;nant of God once you have made it, and don&#x02BC;t break your oaths, for you have made God your sure&shy;ty and He knows all that you do.

<p>
    <sup>16:93</sup>&#8239;If God wanted, He could have made you all one peo&shy;ple, but He lets some stray and guides oth&shy;ers.  You will be ac&shy;count&shy;a&shy;ble for your ac&shy;tions.
    <sup>94</sup>&#8239;Don&#x02BC;t use your oaths to de&shy;ceive one an&shy;oth&shy;er, lest a foot slip that was firm&shy;ly planted. Then you will taste the evil of hindering some&shy;one from God&#x02BC;s path, and will suf&shy;fer great pun&shy;ish&shy;ment.

    <sup>18:32</sup>&#8239;Set forth to them the par&shy;a&shy;ble of two men: for one of them We pro&shy;vid&shy;ed two gar&shy;dens of grape-vines and sur&shy;rounded them with date palms; in be&shy;tween the two We placed corn-fields.
    <sup>33</sup>&#8239;Each of those gar&shy;dens brought forth its pro&shy;duce, and failed not in the least there&shy;in: in the midst of them We caused a riv&shy;er to flow.
    <sup>34</sup>&#8239;(Abundant) was the pro&shy;duce this man had: he sa&shy;id to his com&shy;pan&shy;ion, in the course of a mu&shy;tu&shy;al ar&shy;gu&shy;ment: <q>more wealth have I than you, and more honour and pow&shy;er in (my fol&shy;low&shy;ing of) men.</q>
    <sup>35</sup>&#8239;He went in&shy;to his gar&shy;den in a state (of mind) un&shy;just to his soul: He sa&shy;id, <q>I deem not that this will ev&shy;er per&shy;ish,
    <sup>36</sup>&#8239;Nor do I deem that the Hour (of Judg&shy;ment) will (ever) come: E&shy;ven if I am brought back to my Lord, I shall sure&shy;ly find (there) some&shy;thing bet&shy;ter in ex&shy;change.</q>
    <sup>37</sup>&#8239;His com&shy;pan&shy;ion sa&shy;id to him, in the course of the ar&shy;gu&shy;ment with him: <q>Dost thou de&shy;ny Him Who cre&shy;at&shy;ed thee out of dust, then out of a sperm-drop, then fash&shy;ioned thee in&shy;to a man?
    <sup>38</sup>&#8239;But (I think) for my part that He is God, My Lord, and none shall I as&shy;so&shy;ci&shy;ate with my Lord.
    <sup>39</sup>&#8239;Why didst thou not, as thou wentest in&shy;to thy gar&shy;den, say: <q>God&#x02BC;s will (be done)! There is no pow&shy;er but with God!</q> If thou dost see me less than thee in wealth and sons,
    <sup>40</sup>&#8239;It may be that my Lord will give me some&shy;thing bet&shy;ter than thy gar&shy;den, and that He will send on thy gar&shy;den thun&shy;der&shy;bolts (by way of reck&shy;on&shy;ing) from heav&shy;en, mak&shy;ing it (but) slip&shy;per&shy;y sand!-
    <sup>41</sup>&#8239;Or the wa&shy;ter of the gar&shy;den will run off un&shy;der&shy;ground so that thou wilt nev&shy;er be a&shy;ble to find it.</q>
    <sup>42</sup>&#8239;So his fruits (and en&shy;joy&shy;ment) were en&shy;com&shy;passed (with ru&shy;in), and he re&shy;mained twisting and turn&shy;ing his hands o&shy;ver what he had spent on his prop&shy;er&shy;ty, which had (now) tumbled to pieces to its ver&shy;y founda&shy;tions, and he could on&shy;ly say, <q>Woe is me! Would I had nev&shy;er as&shy;cribed part&shy;ners to my Lord and Cher&shy;ish&shy;er!</q>
    <sup>43</sup>&#8239;Nor had he num&shy;bers to help him a&shy;gainst God, nor was he a&shy;ble to de&shy;liv&shy;er him&shy;self.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>18:45</sup>&#8239;Set forth to them the si&shy;mil&shy;i&shy;tude of the life of this world: It is like the rain which we send down from the skies: the earth&#x02BC;s veg&shy;e&shy;ta&shy;tion ab&shy;sorbs it, but soon it be&shy;comes dry stub&shy;ble, which the winds do scat&shy;ter: it is (only) God who pre&shy;vails o&shy;ver all things.
    <sup>46</sup>&#8239;Wealth and sons are al&shy;lure&shy;ments of the life of this world: But the things that en&shy;dure, good deeds, are best in the sight of thy Lord, as re&shy;wards, and best as (the foun&shy;da&shy;tion for) hopes.

    <sup>82</sup>&#8239;But, with&shy;out doubt, I am (also) He that for&shy;gives a&shy;gain and a&shy;gain, to those who re&shy;pent, be&shy;lieve, and do right, who,- in fi&shy;ne, are read&shy;y to re&shy;ceive true guid&shy;ance.</q>

    <sup>26:176</sup>&#8239;The Com&shy;pan&shy;ions of the Wood re&shy;jected the mes&shy;sen&shy;gers.
    <sup>177</sup>&#8239;Be&shy;hold, Shu&#x02BC;aib sa&shy;id to them: <q>Will ye not fear (God)?
    <sup>178</sup>&#8239;I am to you a mes&shy;sen&shy;ger wor&shy;thy of all trust.
    <sup>179</sup>&#8239;So fear God and o&shy;bey me.
    <sup>180</sup>&#8239;No re&shy;ward do I ask of you for it: my re&shy;ward is on&shy;ly from the Lord of the Worlds.
    <sup>181</sup>&#8239;Give just meas&shy;ure, and cause no loss (to oth&shy;ers by fraud).
    <sup>182</sup>&#8239;And weigh with scales true and up&shy;right.
    <sup>183</sup>&#8239;And with&shy;hold not things just&shy;ly due to men, nor do evil in the land, work&shy;ing mis&shy;chief.
    <sup>184</sup>&#8239;And fear Him Who cre&shy;at&shy;ed you and (who cre&shy;at&shy;ed) the gen&shy;er&shy;a&shy;tions be&shy;fore (you)</q>
    <sup>185</sup>&#8239;They sa&shy;id: <q>Thou art on&shy;ly one of those be&shy;witched!
    <sup>186</sup>&#8239;Thou art no more than a mor&shy;tal like us, and in&shy;deed we think thou art a li&shy;ar!
    <sup>187</sup>&#8239;Now cause a piece of the sky to fall on us, if thou art truth&shy;ful!</q>
    <sup>188</sup>&#8239;He sa&shy;id: <q>My Lord knows best what ye do.</q>
    <sup>189</sup>&#8239;But they re&shy;jected him. Then the pun&shy;ish&shy;ment of a day of overshadowing gloom seized them, and that was the Pen&shy;al&shy;ty of a Great Day.

<p>
    <sup>26:214</sup>&#8239;And ad&shy;mon&shy;ish thy nearest kinsmen,
    <sup>215</sup>&#8239;And low&shy;er thy wing to the Be&shy;liev&shy;ers who fol&shy;low thee.
    <sup>216</sup>&#8239;Then if they dis&shy;o&shy;bey thee, say: <q>I am free (of re&shy;spon&shy;si&shy;bil&shy;i&shy;ty) for what ye do!</q>
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>28:50</sup>&#8239;But if they heark&shy;en not to thee, know that they on&shy;ly fol&shy;low their own lusts: and who is more a&shy;stray than one who fol&shy;low his own lusts, de&shy;void of guid&shy;ance from God? For God guides not peo&shy;ple giv&shy;en to wrong-doing.
    <sup>51</sup>&#8239;Now have We caused the Word to reach them them&shy;selves, in or&shy;der that they may re&shy;ceive ad&shy;mo&shy;ni&shy;tion.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>28:54</sup>&#8239;Twice will they be giv&shy;en their re&shy;ward, for that they have persevered, that they a&shy;vert Evil with Good, and that they spend (in char&shy;i&shy;ty) out of what We have giv&shy;en them.
    <sup>55</sup>&#8239;And when they hear vain talk, they turn a&shy;way there&shy;from and say: <q>To us our deeds, and to you yours; peace be to you: we seek not the ig&shy;no&shy;rant.</q>
    <sup>56</sup>&#8239;It is true thou wilt not be a&shy;ble to guide eve&shy;ry one, whom thou lovest.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>28:76</sup>&#8239;His peo&shy;ple sa&shy;id to him: <q>Ex&shy;ult not, for God loveth not those who ex&shy;ult (in rich&shy;es).
    <sup>77</sup>&#8239;But seek, with the (wealth) which God has be&shy;stowed on thee, the Home of the Here&shy;af&shy;ter, nor for&shy;get thy por&shy;tion in this world: but do thou good, as God has been good to thee, and seek not (occasions for) mis&shy;chief in the land: for God loves not those who do mis&shy;chief.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>28:79</sup>&#8239;So he went forth a&shy;mong his peo&shy;ple in the (pride of his wordly) glit&shy;ter. Sa&shy;id those whose aim is the Life of this World: <q>Oh! that we had the like of what Qarun has got! for he is tru&shy;ly a lord of might&shy;y good for&shy;tune!</q>
    <sup>80</sup>&#8239;But those who had been grant&shy;ed (true) knowl&shy;edge sa&shy;id: <q>A&shy;las for you! The re&shy;ward of God (in the Here&shy;af&shy;ter) is best for those who be&shy;lieve and work right&shy;eous&shy;ness: but this none shall at&shy;tain, save those who stead&shy;fast&shy;ly per&shy;se&shy;vere (in good).</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>28:84</sup>&#8239;If any does good, the re&shy;ward to him is bet&shy;ter than his deed; but if any does evil, the do&shy;ers of evil are on&shy;ly pun&shy;ished (to the ex&shy;tent) of their deeds.

    <sup>29:7</sup>&#8239;Those who be&shy;lieve and work right&shy;eous deeds,- from them shall We blot out all evil (that may be) in them, and We shall re&shy;ward them ac&shy;cord&shy;ing to the best of their deeds.
    <sup>8</sup>&#8239;We have en&shy;joined on man kind&shy;ness to par&shy;ents: but if they (either of them) strive (to force) thee to join with Me (in wor&shy;ship) any&shy;thing of which thou hast no knowl&shy;edge, o&shy;bey them not. Ye have (all) to re&shy;turn to me, and I will tell you (the truth) of all that ye did.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>29:10</sup>&#8239;Then there are a&shy;mong men such as say, <q>We be&shy;lieve in God</q>; but when they suf&shy;fer af&shy;flic&shy;tion in (the cause of) God, they treat men&#x02BC;s op&shy;pres&shy;sion as if it were the Wrath of God! And if help co&shy;mes (to thee) from thy Lord, they are sure to say, <q>We have (always) been with you!</q> Does not God know best all that is in the hearts of all cre&shy;a&shy;tion?
</p>

<p>
    <sup>29:45</sup>&#8239;Pray&shy;er re&shy;strains from shame&shy;ful and un&shy;just deeds; and re&shy;mem&shy;brance of God is the great&shy;est (thing in life) with&shy;out doubt. And God knows the (deeds) that ye do.
    <sup>46</sup>&#8239;And dis&shy;pute ye not with the Peo&shy;ple of the Book, but say, <q>We be&shy;lieve in the rev&shy;e&shy;la&shy;tion which has come down to us and in that which came down to you; Our God and your God is one; and it is to Him we bow (in Islam).</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>29:57</sup>&#8239;Eve&shy;ry soul shall have a taste of death in the end to Us shall ye be brought back.
    <sup>58</sup>&#8239;But those who be&shy;lieve and work deeds of right&shy;eous&shy;ness - to them shall We give a Home in Heav&shy;en,- loft&shy;y man&shy;sions be&shy;neath which flow riv&shy;ers,- to dwell there&shy;in for aye;- an ex&shy;cel&shy;lent re&shy;ward for those who do (good)!-

    <sup>30:21</sup>&#8239;And a&shy;mong His Signs is this, that He cre&shy;at&shy;ed for you mates from a&shy;mong your&shy;selves, that ye may dwell in tran&shy;quil&shy;li&shy;ty with them, and He has put love and mer&shy;cy be&shy;tween your (hearts): ver&shy;i&shy;ly in that are Signs for those who re&shy;flect.
    <sup>22</sup>&#8239;And a&shy;mong His Signs is the cre&shy;a&shy;tion of the heav&shy;ens and the earth, and the var&shy;i&shy;a&shy;tions in your lan&shy;guages and your colours: ver&shy;i&shy;ly in that are Signs for those who know.
    <sup>23</sup>&#8239;And a&shy;mong His Signs is the sleep that ye take by night and by day, and the quest that ye (make for live&shy;li&shy;hood) out of His Boun&shy;ty: ver&shy;i&shy;ly in that are signs for those who heark&shy;en.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>30:33</sup>&#8239;When trou&shy;ble touches men, they cry to their Lord, turn&shy;ing back to Him in re&shy;pent&shy;ance: but when He gives them a taste of Mer&shy;cy as from Him&shy;self, be&shy;hold, some of them pay part-worship to oth&shy;er gods be&shy;sides their Lord,-
    <sup>34</sup>&#8239;(As if) to show their in&shy;grat&shy;i&shy;tude for the (favours) We have be&shy;stowed on them! Then en&shy;joy (your brief day); but soon will ye know (your fol&shy;ly).
</p>

<p>
    <sup>30:36</sup>&#8239;When We give men a taste of Mer&shy;cy, they ex&shy;ult there&shy;at: and when some evil af&shy;flicts them be&shy;cause of what their (own) hands have sent forth, be&shy;hold, they are in de&shy;spair!
</p>

<p>
    <sup>30:38</sup>&#8239;So give what is due to kin&shy;dred, the needy, and the way&shy;far&shy;er. That is best for those who seek the Coun&shy;te&shy;nance, of God, and it is they who will pros&shy;per.
    <sup>39</sup>&#8239;That which ye lay out for in&shy;crease through the prop&shy;er&shy;ty of (other) peo&shy;ple, will have no in&shy;crease with God: but that which ye lay out for char&shy;i&shy;ty, seek&shy;ing the Coun&shy;te&shy;nance of God, (will in&shy;crease): it is these who will get a rec&shy;om&shy;pense mul&shy;ti&shy;plied.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>30:47</sup>&#8239;We did in&shy;deed send, be&shy;fore thee, mes&shy;sen&shy;gers to their (respective) peo&shy;ples, and they came to them with Clear Signs: then, to those who trans&shy;gressed, We met&shy;ed out Ret&shy;ri&shy;bu&shy;tion: and it was due from Us to aid those who be&shy;lieved.

    <sup>14</sup>&#8239;And We have en&shy;joined on man (to be good) to his par&shy;ents: in tra&shy;vail up&shy;on tra&shy;vail did his moth&shy;er bear him, and in years twain was his weaning: (hear the com&shy;mand), <q>Show grat&shy;i&shy;tude to Me and to thy par&shy;ents: to Me is (thy fi&shy;nal) Goal.
    <sup>15</sup>&#8239;But if they strive to make thee join in wor&shy;ship with Me things of which thou hast no knowl&shy;edge, o&shy;bey them not; yet bear them com&shy;pa&shy;ny in this life with jus&shy;tice (and con&shy;sid&shy;er&shy;a&shy;tion), and fol&shy;low the way of those who turn to me (in love): in the end the re&shy;turn of you all is to Me, and I will tell you the truth (and mean&shy;ing) of all that ye did.</q>

<p>
    <sup>31:32</sup>&#8239;When a wave co&shy;vers them like the can&shy;o&shy;py (of clouds), they call to God, of&shy;fer&shy;ing Him sin&shy;cere de&shy;vo&shy;tion.

<p>
    <sup>75:1</sup>&#8239;I do call to wit&shy;ness the Res&shy;ur&shy;rec&shy;tion Day;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>75:13</sup>&#8239;That Day will Man be told (all) that he put for&shy;ward, and all that he put back.
    <sup>14</sup>&#8239;Nay, man will be ev&shy;i&shy;dence a&shy;gainst him&shy;self,
    <sup>15</sup>&#8239;E&shy;ven though he were to put up his ex&shy;cuses.

<p>
    <sup>76:7</sup>&#8239;They per&shy;form (their) vows, and they fear a Day whose evil flies far and wide.
    <sup>8</sup>&#8239;And they feed, for the love of God, the in&shy;di&shy;gent, the or&shy;phan, and the cap&shy;tive,-
    <sup>9</sup>&#8239;(Saying), <q>We feed you for the sa&shy;ke of God a&shy;lone: no re&shy;ward do we de&shy;sire from you, nor thanks.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>76:24</sup>&#8239;There&shy;fore be pa&shy;tient with con&shy;stan&shy;cy to the Com&shy;mand of thy Lord, and heark&shy;en not to the sin&shy;ner or the in&shy;grate a&shy;mong them.
    <sup>25</sup>&#8239;And cel&shy;e&shy;brate the name of thy Lord morn&shy;ing and eve&shy;ning,
    <sup>26</sup>&#8239;And part of the night, pros&shy;trate thy&shy;self to Him; and glo&shy;ri&shy;fy Him a long night through.

    <sup>80:1</sup>&#8239;(The Proph&shy;et) frowned and turned a&shy;way,
    <sup>2</sup>&#8239;Be&shy;cause there came to him the blind man (interrupting).
    <sup>3</sup>&#8239;But what could tell thee but that per&shy;chance he might grow (in spir&shy;it&shy;u&shy;al un&shy;der&shy;stand&shy;ing)?-
    <sup>4</sup>&#8239;Or that he might re&shy;ceive ad&shy;mo&shy;ni&shy;tion, and the teach&shy;ing might prof&shy;it him?
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>81:1</sup>&#8239;When the sun (with its spa&shy;cious light) is folded up;
    <sup>2</sup>&#8239;When the stars fall, los&shy;ing their lus&shy;tre;
    <sup>3</sup>&#8239;When the moun&shy;tains van&shy;ish (like a mi&shy;rage);
</p>

<p>
    <sup>81:7</sup>&#8239;When the souls are sorted out, (being joined, like with like);
    <sup>8</sup>&#8239;When the fe&shy;male (infant), bur&shy;ied a&shy;live, is ques&shy;tioned -
    <sup>9</sup>&#8239;For what crime she was killed;
    <sup>10</sup>&#8239;When the scrolls are laid o&shy;pen;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>81:14</sup>&#8239;(Then) shall each soul know what it has put for&shy;ward.
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>83:1</sup>&#8239;Woe to those that deal in fraud,-
    <sup>2</sup>&#8239;Those who, when they have to re&shy;ceive by meas&shy;ure from men, ex&shy;act full meas&shy;ure,
    <sup>3</sup>&#8239;But when they have to give by meas&shy;ure or weight to men, give less than due.
    <sup>4</sup>&#8239;Do they not think that they will be called to ac&shy;count?-
    <sup>5</sup>&#8239;On a Might&shy;y Day,
    <sup>6</sup>&#8239;A Day when (all) man&shy;kind will stand be&shy;fore the Lord of the Worlds?
</p>

<p>
    <sup>83:29</sup>&#8239;Those in sin used to laugh at those who be&shy;lieved,
    <sup>30</sup>&#8239;And when&shy;ev&shy;er they passed by them, used to wink at each oth&shy;er (in mock&shy;er&shy;y);
    <sup>31</sup>&#8239;And when they re&shy;turned to their own peo&shy;ple, they would re&shy;turn jest&shy;ing;
    <sup>32</sup>&#8239;And when&shy;ev&shy;er they saw them, they would say, <q>Be&shy;hold! These are the peo&shy;ple tru&shy;ly a&shy;stray!</q>
    <sup>33</sup>&#8239;But they had not been sent as keep&shy;ers o&shy;ver them!

<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>87:2</sup>&#8239;Who hath cre&shy;at&shy;ed, and fur&shy;ther, giv&shy;en or&shy;der and pro&shy;por&shy;tion;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>87:8</sup>&#8239;And We will make it eas&shy;y for thee (to fol&shy;low) the sim&shy;ple (Path).
    <sup>9</sup>&#8239;There&shy;fore give ad&shy;mo&shy;ni&shy;tion in case the ad&shy;mo&shy;ni&shy;tion prof&shy;its (the hear&shy;er).
    <sup>10</sup>&#8239;The ad&shy;mo&shy;ni&shy;tion will be re&shy;ceived by those who fear (God):
    <sup>11</sup>&#8239;But it will be a&shy;voided by those most un&shy;for&shy;tu&shy;nate ones,
</p>

<p>
    <sup>87:14</sup>&#8239;But those will pros&shy;per who pu&shy;ri&shy;fy them&shy;selves,
    <sup>15</sup>&#8239;And glo&shy;ri&shy;fy the name of their Guard&shy;i&shy;an-Lord, and (lift their hearts) in pray&shy;er.
    <sup>16</sup>&#8239;Nay (behold), ye pre&shy;fer the life of this world;
    <sup>17</sup>&#8239;But the Here&shy;af&shy;ter is bet&shy;ter and more en&shy;dur&shy;ing.
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>89:15</sup>&#8239;Now, as for man, when his Lord trieth him, giv&shy;ing him honour and gifts, then saith he, (puffed up), <q>My Lord hath honoured me.</q>
    <sup>16</sup>&#8239;But when He trieth him, restricting his sub&shy;sist&shy;ence for him, then saith he (in de&shy;spair), <q>My Lord hath hu&shy;mil&shy;i&shy;at&shy;ed me!</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>89:17</sup>&#8239;Nay, nay! but ye honour not the or&shy;phans!
    <sup>18</sup>&#8239;Nor do ye en&shy;cour&shy;age one an&shy;oth&shy;er to feed the poor!-
    <sup>19</sup>&#8239;And ye de&shy;vour in&shy;her&shy;it&shy;ance - all with greed,
    <sup>20</sup>&#8239;And ye love wealth with in&shy;or&shy;di&shy;nate love!
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>92:1</sup>&#8239;By the Night as it con&shy;ceals (the light);
    <sup>2</sup>&#8239;By the Day as it ap&shy;pears in glo&shy;ry;
    <sup>3</sup>&#8239;By (the mys&shy;ter&shy;y of) the cre&shy;a&shy;tion of male and fe&shy;male;-
    <sup>4</sup>&#8239;Ver&shy;i&shy;ly, (the ends) ye strive for are di&shy;verse.
    <sup>5</sup>&#8239;So he who gives (in char&shy;i&shy;ty) and fears (God),
    <sup>6</sup>&#8239;And (in all sin&shy;cer&shy;i&shy;ty) testifies to the best,-
    <sup>7</sup>&#8239;We will in&shy;deed make smooth for him the path to Bliss.
    <sup>8</sup>&#8239;But he who is a greed&shy;y mi&shy;ser and thinks him&shy;self self-sufficient,
    <sup>9</sup>&#8239;And gives the lie to the best,-
    <sup>10</sup>&#8239;We will in&shy;deed make smooth for him the path to Mis&shy;er&shy;y;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>92:17</sup>&#8239;But those most de&shy;vot&shy;ed to God shall be re&shy;moved far from it,-
    <sup>18</sup>&#8239;Those who spend their wealth for in&shy;crease in self-purification,
    <sup>19</sup>&#8239;And have in their minds no fa&shy;vour from any&shy;one for which a re&shy;ward is ex&shy;pected in re&shy;turn,
    <sup>20</sup>&#8239;But on&shy;ly the de&shy;sire to seek for the Coun&shy;te&shy;nance of their Lord Most High;
    <sup>21</sup>&#8239;And soon will they at&shy;tain (complete) sat&shy;is&shy;fac&shy;tion.
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>93:6</sup>&#8239;Did He not find thee an or&shy;phan and give thee shel&shy;ter (and care)?
    <sup>7</sup>&#8239;And He found thee wan&shy;der&shy;ing, and He gave thee guid&shy;ance.
    <sup>8</sup>&#8239;And He found thee in need, and made thee in&shy;de&shy;pend&shy;ent.
    <sup>9</sup>&#8239;There&shy;fore, treat not the or&shy;phan with harsh&shy;ness,
    <sup>10</sup>&#8239;Nor re&shy;pulse the pe&shy;ti&shy;tion&shy;er (unheard);
    <sup>11</sup>&#8239;But the boun&shy;ty of the Lord - re&shy;hearse and pro&shy;claim!
</p>

<p>
    <sup>94:5</sup>&#8239;So, ver&shy;i&shy;ly, with eve&shy;ry dif&shy;fi&shy;cul&shy;ty, there is re&shy;lief:
    <sup>6</sup>&#8239;Ver&shy;i&shy;ly, with eve&shy;ry dif&shy;fi&shy;cul&shy;ty there is re&shy;lief.

<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>96:3</sup>&#8239;Pro&shy;claim! And thy Lord is Most Boun&shy;ti&shy;ful,-
    <sup>4</sup>&#8239;He Who taught (the use of) the pen,-
    <sup>5</sup>&#8239;Taught man that which he knew not.
    <sup>6</sup>&#8239;Nay, but man doth trans&shy;gress all bounds,
    <sup>7</sup>&#8239;In that he looketh up&shy;on him&shy;self as self-sufficient.
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>104:1</sup>&#8239;Woe to eve&shy;ry (kind of) scan&shy;dal-monger and-backbiter,
    <sup>2</sup>&#8239;Who pileth up wealth and layeth it by,
    <sup>3</sup>&#8239;Think&shy;ing that his wealth would make him last for&shy;ev&shy;er!
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>107:1</sup>&#8239;Seest thou one who denies the Judg&shy;ment (to come)?
    <sup>2</sup>&#8239;Then such is the (man) who re&shy;pulses the or&shy;phan (with harsh&shy;ness),
    <sup>3</sup>&#8239;And en&shy;cour&shy;ages not the feed&shy;ing of the in&shy;di&shy;gent.
    <sup>4</sup>&#8239;So woe to the worshippers
    <sup>5</sup>&#8239;Who are ne&shy;glect&shy;ful of their pray&shy;ers,
    <sup>6</sup>&#8239;Those who (want but) to be seen (of men),
    <sup>7</sup>&#8239;But re&shy;fuse (to sup&shy;ply) (even) neigh&shy;bour&shy;ly needs.

    <sup>3</sup>&#8239;Nor will ye wor&shy;ship that which I wor&shy;ship.
    <sup>4</sup>&#8239;And I will not wor&shy;ship that which ye have been wont to wor&shy;ship,
    <sup>5</sup>&#8239;Nor will ye wor&shy;ship that which I wor&shy;ship.
