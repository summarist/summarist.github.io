    <sup>1:1</sup>&#8239;In the name of God, Most Gra&shy;cious, Most Mer&shy;ci&shy;ful.
    <sup>2</sup>&#8239;All praise is owed to God, sus&shy;tain&shy;er of the worlds,
    <sup>4</sup>&#8239;Mas&shy;ter of the Day of Judg&shy;ment.
    <sup>5</sup>&#8239;You a&shy;lone we wor&shy;ship, and you a&shy;lone we ask for help.
    <sup>6</sup>&#8239;Guide us to the straight path;
    <sup>7</sup>&#8239;the path of those you have bless&shy;ed, not of those who earned your an&shy;ger, nor of those who stray.
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>2:2</sup>&#8239;This book is a guid&shy;ance for those con&shy;scious of God,
    <sup>3</sup>&#8239;who be&shy;lieve in the un&shy;seen, are stead&shy;fast in pray&shy;er, give out of what We have pro&shy;vid&shy;ed them,
    <sup>4</sup>&#8239;be&shy;lieve in the rev&shy;e&shy;la&shy;tion sent to you, Muhammad, and what was sent be&shy;fore your time, and who have firm faith in the here&shy;af&shy;ter.
    <sup>5</sup>&#8239;They are fol&shy;low&shy;ing guid&shy;ance from their Lord, and they will pros&shy;per.
    <sup>6</sup>&#8239;As for those who dis&shy;be&shy;lieve, it is the same to them wheth&shy;er you warn them or not: they won&#x02BC;t be&shy;lieve.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:42</sup>&#8239;Don&#x02BC;t mix truth with false&shy;hood, nor know&shy;ing&shy;ly con&shy;ceal the truth.
    <sup>43</sup>&#8239;Be stead&shy;fast in pray&shy;er, spend in char&shy;i&shy;ty, and bow down with those who bow down in wor&shy;ship.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:44</sup>&#8239;Do you en&shy;join right&shy;eous&shy;ness on the peo&shy;ple and for&shy;get to do it your&shy;selves, e&shy;ven though you re&shy;cite the Scrip&shy;ture? Have you no sense?
    <sup>45</sup>&#8239;Seek help with pa&shy;tience and pray&shy;er. It is dif&shy;fi&shy;cult in&shy;deed, ex&shy;cept for the hum&shy;ble,
    <sup>46</sup>&#8239;who are cer&shy;tain that they will meet their Lord and re&shy;turn to Him.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:62</sup>&#8239;All who be&shy;lieve in God and the Last Day, and do right&shy;eous&shy;ness, will have their re&shy;ward with their Lord. They will have no fear, nor will they grieve.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:79</sup>&#8239;Woe to those who write a book with their own hands then say, <q>This is from God,</q> in or&shy;der to sell it for a small price!
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:111</sup>&#8239;They say, <q>None will en&shy;ter Par&shy;a&shy;dise un&shy;less he is a Jew or a Christian.</q>
    <sup>112</sup>&#8239;In fact, who&shy;ev&shy;er sub&shy;mits him&shy;self whol&shy;ly to God and does good will have his re&shy;ward with his Lord.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:135</sup>&#8239;They say, <q>Be&shy;come Jews or Christians, then you will be right&shy;ly guid&shy;ed.</q>
    <sup>136</sup>&#8239;Say, <q>We be&shy;lieve in God, and the rev&shy;e&shy;la&shy;tion giv&shy;en to us, and to Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob, and their de&shy;scend&shy;ants, and the rev&shy;e&shy;la&shy;tion giv&shy;en to Mo&shy;ses, Jesus, and the proph&shy;ets from their Lord.  We make no dis&shy;tinc&shy;tion be&shy;tween any of them, and we sub&shy;mit to Him.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:153</sup>&#8239;Be&shy;liev&shy;ers, seek help through pa&shy;tience and pray&shy;er. For God is with the stead&shy;fast.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:172</sup>&#8239;Be&shy;liev&shy;ers, eat the good things We have pro&shy;vid&shy;ed for you, and be grate&shy;ful to God, if it is Him you wor&shy;ship.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:177</sup>&#8239;Right&shy;eous&shy;ness is not turn&shy;ing your faces to&shy;wards east or west, but right&shy;eous&shy;ness is one who be&shy;lieves in God, the Last Day, the an&shy;gels, the Book, and the proph&shy;ets; who gives of his wealth, e&shy;ven though he loves it, to rel&shy;a&shy;tives, or&shy;phans, the needy, the trav&shy;el&shy;er, beg&shy;gars, and for free&shy;ing slaves; who are stead&shy;fast in pray&shy;er, and spend in char&shy;i&shy;ty; who keep their prom&shy;ises; and are pa&shy;tient in pov&shy;er&shy;ty, ad&shy;ver&shy;si&shy;ty, and dur&shy;ing bat&shy;tle. These ones are true, and con&shy;scious of God.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:180</sup>&#8239;When death approaches any of you and he leaves be&shy;hind wealth, it is pre&shy;scribed that he make a prop&shy;er be&shy;quest to par&shy;ents and near rel&shy;a&shy;tives. This is a du&shy;ty for those con&shy;scious of God.
    <sup>181</sup>&#8239;If any&shy;one al&shy;ters the be&shy;quest af&shy;ter hear&shy;ing it, the sin is on them: God hears and knows all.
    <sup>182</sup>&#8239;But if any&shy;one fears that the tes&shy;ta&shy;tor made a mis&shy;take or did wrong, and makes peace be&shy;tween the heirs, he in&shy;curs no sin: God is for&shy;giv&shy;ing and mer&shy;ci&shy;ful.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:183</sup>&#8239;Be&shy;liev&shy;ers, fasting is pre&shy;scribed for you, as it was for those be&shy;fore you, that you may be&shy;come con&shy;scious of God.
    <sup>184</sup>&#8239;Fast for a spe&shy;cif&shy;ic num&shy;ber of days, but if you are sick or trav&shy;el&shy;ing, make up the days lat&shy;er. Those who can on&shy;ly fast with dif&shy;fi&shy;cul&shy;ty may feed a poor per&shy;son in&shy;stead. Who&shy;ev&shy;er vol&shy;un&shy;teers to give more, it is bet&shy;ter for him.
    <sup>185</sup>&#8239;In the month of Ramadan the Qur&#x02BC;an was re&shy;vealed as a guid&shy;ance for man&shy;kind, as a clear sign of that guid&shy;ance, and as judg&shy;ment be&shy;tween right and wrong. So who&shy;ev&shy;er is pres&shy;ent dur&shy;ing that month should fast. God wants ease for you, not hard&shy;ship; and per&shy;haps you will be grate&shy;ful.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:188</sup>&#8239;Don&#x02BC;t con&shy;sume one an&shy;oth&shy;er&#x02BC;s prop&shy;er&shy;ty un&shy;just&shy;ly, nor use it to bribe judges, intending to con&shy;sume some of the prop&shy;er&shy;ty of oth&shy;ers sin&shy;ful&shy;ly and know&shy;ing&shy;ly.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:215</sup>&#8239;What&shy;ev&shy;er you spend in char&shy;i&shy;ty should be for par&shy;ents, close rel&shy;a&shy;tives, or&shy;phans, the poor, and for trav&shy;el&shy;ers.  What&shy;ev&shy;er good you do, God knows it well.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:216</sup>&#8239;You may dis&shy;like some&shy;thing that&#x02BC;s good for you, and love some&shy;thing that&#x02BC;s bad for you. God knows, and you do not.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:219</sup>&#8239;They ask you a&shy;bout wine and gambling. Say, <q>In them is great sin, yet some ben&shy;e&shy;fit, but the sin is greater than the ben&shy;e&shy;fit.</q> They ask you how much they should give. Say, <q>The ex&shy;cess.</q>
    <sup>220</sup>&#8239;They ask you a&shy;bout or&shy;phans. Say, <q>Im&shy;prov&shy;ing their con&shy;di&shy;tion is best. God knows who spoils things and who im&shy;proves them. If God had wished, He could have put you in&shy;to difficul&shy;ties.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:221</sup>&#8239;Don&#x02BC;t mar&shy;ry i&shy;dol&shy;a&shy;trous wom&shy;en un&shy;til they be&shy;lieve. A slave who be&shy;lieves is bet&shy;ter than an i&shy;dol&shy;a&shy;tress, e&shy;ven if she pleases you. These in&shy;vite you to the fire.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:238</sup>&#8239;Strict&shy;ly guard your hab&shy;it of pray&shy;ers. Stand be&shy;fore God in de&shy;vout o&shy;be&shy;di&shy;ence.
    <sup>239</sup>&#8239;If you are in dan&shy;ger, pray walk&shy;ing or rid&shy;ing, but when you are se&shy;cure, re&shy;mem&shy;ber God, for He taught you what you did not know.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:256</sup>&#8239;There shall be no com&shy;pul&shy;sion in re&shy;li&shy;gion. The right path has be&shy;come clear from the wrong. Who&shy;ev&shy;er re&shy;jects false gods and be&shy;lieves in God has grasped the most trust&shy;wor&shy;thy hand&shy;hold that nev&shy;er breaks.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:261</sup>&#8239;Those who spend their wealth in God&#x02BC;s cause are like a grain of corn which grows sev&shy;en ears, and each ear has a hun&shy;dred grains.
    <sup>262</sup>&#8239;Those who spend their wealth in God&#x02BC;s cause will have their re&shy;ward with their Lord: they will have no fear, nor will they grieve.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:263</sup>&#8239;Kind words and for&shy;give&shy;ness are bet&shy;ter than char&shy;i&shy;ty fol&shy;lowed by in&shy;ju&shy;ry.
    <sup>264</sup>&#8239;Be&shy;liev&shy;ers, don&#x02BC;t can&shy;cel your char&shy;i&shy;ty with reminders of your gen&shy;er&shy;os&shy;i&shy;ty or with in&shy;ju&shy;ry, like those who spend their wealth to be seen of men, but do not be&shy;lieve in God or the Last Day. They are like a smooth rock with dust on it. Heav&shy;y rain falls, leav&shy;ing it bare. They are un&shy;a&shy;ble to keep any&shy;thing they have earned. God does not guide dis&shy;be&shy;liev&shy;ers.
    <sup>265</sup>&#8239;Those who spend their wealth seek&shy;ing to please God are like a gar&shy;den on high ground. Heav&shy;y rain falls, yield&shy;ing a dou&shy;ble har&shy;vest. If heav&shy;y rain doesn&#x02BC;t fall, light rain will.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:267</sup>&#8239;Be&shy;liev&shy;ers, give from the good things which you have earned. Do not give from what is bad, when you your&shy;selves would on&shy;ly ac&shy;cept it if your eyes were closed.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:268</sup>&#8239;Satan threat&shy;ens you with pov&shy;er&shy;ty and or&shy;ders you to com&shy;mit im&shy;mo&shy;ral&shy;i&shy;ty. God prom&shy;ises you His for&shy;give&shy;ness and boun&shy;ty.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:270</sup>&#8239;What&shy;ev&shy;er you give, or vow to give, God knows it. But the wrong&shy;do&shy;ers will have no help&shy;ers.
    <sup>271</sup>&#8239;If you dis&shy;close your char&shy;i&shy;ty, it is good, but if you con&shy;ceal it and give it to the poor, it is bet&shy;ter for you. It will a&shy;tone for some of your bad deeds.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:272</sup>&#8239;What&shy;ev&shy;er char&shy;i&shy;ty you give ben&shy;e&shy;fits your own soul when you do it on&shy;ly to seek the face of God. What&shy;ev&shy;er you give will be repaid to you in full, and you will not be wronged.
    <sup>273</sup>&#8239;Give to the poor who are whol&shy;ly occupied in God&#x02BC;s cause, un&shy;a&shy;ble to trav&shy;el in the land for work. The un&shy;know&shy;ing might think they are rich be&shy;cause of their re&shy;straint, but you will rec&shy;og&shy;nize them be&shy;cause they don&#x02BC;t beg per&shy;sist&shy;ent&shy;ly. What&shy;ev&shy;er good you give, be as&shy;sured that God knows it.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:274</sup>&#8239;Those who give of their pos&shy;ses&shy;sions by night and by day, pri&shy;vate&shy;ly and pub&shy;lic&shy;ly, will have their re&shy;ward with their Lord: they will have no fear, nor will they grieve.
    <sup>277</sup>&#8239;Those who be&shy;lieve, do good works, are stead&shy;fast in pray&shy;er, and spend in char&shy;i&shy;ty, will have their re&shy;ward with their Lord:  they will have no fear, nor will they grieve.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:282</sup>&#8239;When you con&shy;tract a debt for a spec&shy;i&shy;fied term, write it down. Let the debt&shy;or write, and not di&shy;min&shy;ish what he owes. Bring two witnesses. They must not ref&shy;use when called to tes&shy;ti&shy;fy. Do not dis&shy;dain to write down your con&shy;tract, wheth&shy;er it be small or large, a&shy;long with the time it falls due: this is more just with God, more re&shy;li&shy;a&shy;ble as ev&shy;i&shy;dence, and more like&shy;ly to pre&shy;vent doubt be&shy;tween you. If it be an im&shy;me&shy;di&shy;ate trade, there is no blame if you don&#x02BC;t write it down. Have witnesses pres&shy;ent when you trade with one an&shy;oth&shy;er.
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>3:3</sup>&#8239;He sent down to you the Book with the truth, confirming what went be&shy;fore it. He sent down the Torah and the Gos&shy;pel
    <sup>4</sup>&#8239;as a guid&shy;ance for the peo&shy;ple.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>3:14</sup>&#8239;Al&shy;lur&shy;ing to men is the love of their de&shy;sires: wom&shy;en, chil&shy;dren, heap&shy;ing treas&shy;ures of gold and sil&shy;ver, fi&shy;ne hors&shy;es, cat&shy;tle, and farm&shy;land. These are pleas&shy;ures of life in this world, but with God is the best place to re&shy;turn.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>3:92</sup>&#8239;You will on&shy;ly at&shy;tain true pi&shy;e&shy;ty if you give out of what you love. What&shy;ev&shy;er you give, tru&shy;ly, God knows it.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>3:137</sup>&#8239;Sit&shy;u&shy;a&shy;tions sim&shy;i&shy;lar to yours have hap&shy;pened be&shy;fore: trav&shy;el through the earth, and see how it ended for the dis&shy;be&shy;liev&shy;ers.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>3:156</sup>&#8239;Be&shy;liev&shy;ers, don&#x02BC;t say of your broth&shy;ers who trav&shy;eled or went out to fight, <q>If they had stayed with us, they would not have died.</q> This will be&shy;come a source of re&shy;gret in your hearts.
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>4:2</sup>&#8239;Give or&shy;phans their prop&shy;er&shy;ty. Don&#x02BC;t re&shy;place their good things with your bad things, nor con&shy;sume their prop&shy;er&shy;ty to&shy;geth&shy;er with your own. Sure&shy;ly, this is a great sin.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>4:3</sup>&#8239;Mar&shy;ry wom&shy;en of your choice, two or three or four. If you fear that you will not treat them fair&shy;ly, then on&shy;ly one. That will help you a&shy;void bi&shy;as.
    <sup>4</sup>&#8239;Give the wom&shy;en their dow&shy;er gra&shy;cious&shy;ly. If they will&shy;ing&shy;ly re&shy;mit any of it to you, en&shy;joy it with a clear con&shy;science.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>4:5</sup>&#8239;Do not en&shy;trust your prop&shy;er&shy;ty to the weak-minded. God made it a means of sup&shy;port for you, but feed and clothe them with it, and speak to them with kind&shy;ness.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>4:6</sup>&#8239;Test or&shy;phans un&shy;til they reach mar&shy;riage&shy;a&shy;ble age. If they have sound judg&shy;ment, re&shy;lease their prop&shy;er&shy;ty to them. Don&#x02BC;t con&shy;sume it wastefully or hast&shy;i&shy;ly be&shy;fore they grow up. If the guard&shy;i&shy;an is wealth&shy;y, he should take no com&shy;pen&shy;sa&shy;tion. If he is poor, he should use on&shy;ly what is rea&shy;son&shy;a&shy;ble. When you re&shy;lease their prop&shy;er&shy;ty to them, bring witnesses.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>4:7</sup>&#8239;Men and wom&shy;en shall each have a share of what par&shy;ents and close rel&shy;a&shy;tives leave, wheth&shy;er the prop&shy;er&shy;ty is small or large.
    <sup>8</sup>&#8239;If oth&shy;er rel&shy;a&shy;tives, or or&shy;phans, or poor are pres&shy;ent dur&shy;ing the di&shy;vi&shy;sion, then give them some&shy;thing from the es&shy;tate, and speak to them with kind&shy;ness.
    <sup>9</sup>&#8239;Let ex&shy;ec&shy;u&shy;tors have the same fear in their minds as if they had left help&shy;less chil&shy;dren be&shy;hind. Let them fear God, and speak just&shy;ly.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>4:18</sup>&#8239;Re&shy;pent&shy;ance has no ef&shy;fect for those who con&shy;tin&shy;ue to do evil un&shy;til death con&shy;fronts them and they say, <q>Now I re&shy;pent.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>4:19</sup>&#8239;Be&shy;liev&shy;ers, you are for&shy;bid&shy;den to in&shy;her&shy;it wom&shy;en a&shy;gainst their will. Don&#x02BC;t treat your wives harsh&shy;ly. Live with them in kind&shy;ness. If you dis&shy;like them, it may be that you dis&shy;like some&shy;thing in which God has placed much good.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>4:22</sup>&#8239;Don&#x02BC;t mar&shy;ry wom&shy;en whom your fa&shy;thers mar&shy;ried,
    <sup>23</sup>&#8239;wom&shy;en who are close rel&shy;a&shy;tives, your wet nurses, your milk sis&shy;ters, your wives&#x02BC; moth&shy;ers, your step&shy;daugh&shy;ters, those whom your sons mar&shy;ried, two sis&shy;ters at the same time,
    <sup>24</sup>&#8239;and wom&shy;en al&shy;read&shy;y mar&shy;ried. All oth&shy;er wom&shy;en are law&shy;ful to you, pro&shy;vid&shy;ed that you seek them in mar&shy;riage, with dow&shy;er from your prop&shy;er&shy;ty, de&shy;sir&shy;ing mar&shy;riage not for&shy;ni&shy;ca&shy;tion.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>4:29</sup>&#8239;Be&shy;liev&shy;ers, don&#x02BC;t con&shy;sume one an&shy;oth&shy;er&#x02BC;s wealth un&shy;just&shy;ly, but let there be trade by mu&shy;tu&shy;al con&shy;sent. Don&#x02BC;t kill your&shy;selves or one an&shy;oth&shy;er, for God is mer&shy;ci&shy;ful to you.

    <sup>4:31</sup>&#8239;If you a&shy;void the great sins which you are for&shy;bid&shy;den, We will re&shy;move your mi&shy;nor sins, and ad&shy;mit you through the en&shy;trance of hon&shy;or.
    <sup>32</sup>&#8239;Don&#x02BC;t cov&shy;et what God has be&shy;stowed more free&shy;ly on some than on oth&shy;ers. Men and wom&shy;en re&shy;ceive a share of what they earn.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>4:36</sup>&#8239;Wor&shy;ship God, and join noth&shy;ing with Him. Do good to par&shy;ents, rel&shy;a&shy;tives, or&shy;phans, the poor, neigh&shy;bors, the com&shy;pan&shy;ion by your side, and trav&shy;el&shy;ers. God does not like the ar&shy;ro&shy;gant, the boast&shy;ful,
    <sup>37</sup>&#8239;the sting&shy;y; those who com&shy;mand oth&shy;ers to be sting&shy;y, hid&shy;ing the boun&shy;ty God has giv&shy;en them;
    <sup>38</sup>&#8239;those who spend their wealth to be seen by men, and don&#x02BC;t be&shy;lieve in God nor the Last Day.
    <sup>39</sup>&#8239;What harm would it do them to be&shy;lieve in God and the Last Day, and to spend out of what God has pro&shy;vid&shy;ed them?
    <sup>40</sup>&#8239;God wrongs no one in the least de&shy;gree. If there is a good deed, He dou&shy;bles it, and gives a great re&shy;ward.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>4:58</sup>&#8239;God com&shy;mands you to re&shy;turn what you&#x02BC;ve been en&shy;trusted to its right&shy;ful own&shy;er. When you judge be&shy;tween peo&shy;ple, do so with jus&shy;tice.
    <sup>59</sup>&#8239;Be&shy;liev&shy;ers, o&shy;bey God, the Mes&shy;sen&shy;ger, and those in au&shy;thor&shy;i&shy;ty a&shy;mong you.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>4:85</sup>&#8239;Who&shy;ev&shy;er in&shy;ter&shy;cedes for a good cause will share in its re&shy;ward. Who&shy;ev&shy;er in&shy;ter&shy;cedes for an evil cause will share in its bur&shy;den.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>4:86</sup>&#8239;When of&shy;fered a greet&shy;ing, re&shy;spond with a bet&shy;ter one, or at least its e&shy;qual. God takes ac&shy;count of eve&shy;ry&shy;thing.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>4:95</sup>&#8239;God pre&shy;fers the be&shy;liev&shy;ers who strive with their wealth and lives o&shy;ver those who sit &mdash; oth&shy;er than the dis&shy;a&shy;bled. Al&shy;though He has prom&shy;ised good to all of them, those who strive re&shy;ceive a greater re&shy;ward than those who sit.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>4:100</sup>&#8239;Who&shy;ev&shy;er em&shy;i&shy;grates for God&#x02BC;s cause will find on the earth a&shy;bun&shy;dance, and man&shy;y places of ref&shy;uge. If he then dies as a ref&shy;u&shy;gee, his re&shy;ward from God is cer&shy;tain.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>4:101</sup>&#8239;When you trav&shy;el, it&#x02BC;s no sin to short&shy;en your pray&shy;ers, if you fear that dis&shy;be&shy;liev&shy;ers may at&shy;tack you.
    <sup>103</sup>&#8239;When you have com&shy;plet&shy;ed the pray&shy;er, re&shy;mem&shy;ber God: stand&shy;ing, sit&shy;ting, and ly&shy;ing down. Once you are se&shy;cure, re&shy;es&shy;tab&shy;lish reg&shy;u&shy;lar pray&shy;er, for pray&shy;er is man&shy;da&shy;to&shy;ry for be&shy;liev&shy;ers at spe&shy;cif&shy;ic times.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>4:110</sup>&#8239;One who does evil or wrongs him&shy;self, but then asks God for for&shy;give&shy;ness, will find God is for&shy;giv&shy;ing and mer&shy;ci&shy;ful.
    <sup>112</sup>&#8239;But if one sins then blames an in&shy;no&shy;cent per&shy;son, he bur&shy;dens him&shy;self with a slan&shy;der and a fla&shy;grant sin.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>4:123</sup>&#8239;Any&shy;one who does wrong will be repaid ac&shy;cord&shy;ing&shy;ly and will find no pro&shy;tec&shy;tor or help&shy;er be&shy;sides God.
    <sup>124</sup>&#8239;Any be&shy;liev&shy;er, male or fe&shy;male, who does good deeds will en&shy;ter heav&shy;en, and will not re&shy;ceive the least in&shy;jus&shy;tice.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>4:129</sup>&#8239;You will nev&shy;er be a&shy;ble to treat your wives with per&shy;fect fair&shy;ness, how&shy;ev&shy;er much you may want to, but don&#x02BC;t fa&shy;vor one com&shy;plete&shy;ly so as to leave an&shy;oth&shy;er hang&shy;ing. If you make a&shy;mends and are con&shy;scious of God, He is for&shy;giv&shy;ing and mer&shy;ci&shy;ful.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>4:135</sup>&#8239;Be&shy;liev&shy;ers, stead&shy;fast&shy;ly up&shy;hold jus&shy;tice, as witnesses for God, e&shy;ven if it is a&shy;gainst your&shy;selves, your par&shy;ents, or your rel&shy;a&shy;tives. Wheth&shy;er rich or poor, God can best pro&shy;tect them both. Don&#x02BC;t fol&shy;low your own de&shy;sire, lest you swerve from jus&shy;tice. If you dis&shy;tort or ne&shy;glect jus&shy;tice, God knows what you do.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>4:140</sup>&#8239;When you hear peo&shy;ple de&shy;ny and rid&shy;i&shy;cule God&#x02BC;s mes&shy;sages, do not sit with them un&shy;til they change top&shy;ics. Oth&shy;er&shy;wise you will be&shy;come like them: God will gath&shy;er the hyp&shy;o&shy;crites and dis&shy;be&shy;liev&shy;ers in hell.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>4:142</sup>&#8239;When hyp&shy;o&shy;crites stand to pray, they stand la&shy;zi&shy;ly, to be seen of men, remembering God on&shy;ly a lit&shy;tle,
    <sup>143</sup>&#8239;wavering be&shy;tween this and that, be&shy;long&shy;ing to nei&shy;ther these nor those.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>4:148</sup>&#8239;God does not like evil to be men&shy;tioned in pub&shy;lic, ex&shy;cept by the one who was wronged. God hears and knows all.
    <sup>149</sup>&#8239;Wheth&shy;er you do good openly or pri&shy;vate&shy;ly, or par&shy;don an evil, God is for&shy;giv&shy;ing and pow&shy;er&shy;ful.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>4:163</sup>&#8239;Muhammad, we&#x02BC;ve sent you rev&shy;e&shy;la&shy;tion as We did to No&shy;ah and the proph&shy;ets af&shy;ter him: Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob, Jesus, Job, Jonah, Aaron, and Solomon; to David We gave the Psalms;
    <sup>164</sup>&#8239;to oth&shy;er mes&shy;sen&shy;gers We&#x02BC;ve men&shy;tioned be&shy;fore; to oth&shy;ers We hav&shy;en&#x02BC;t men&shy;tioned; and to Mo&shy;ses God spoke di&shy;rect&shy;ly.

    <sup>5:2</sup>&#8239;Some peo&shy;ple shut you out of the Sa&shy;cred Mosque. Don&#x02BC;t let your ha&shy;tred for them lead you to trans&shy;gress. Help one an&shy;oth&shy;er in right&shy;eous&shy;ness and pi&shy;e&shy;ty, but don&#x02BC;t help one an&shy;oth&shy;er in sin and ag&shy;gres&shy;sion. Fear God, for God is se&shy;vere in pun&shy;ish&shy;ment.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>5:7</sup>&#8239;Re&shy;mem&shy;ber God&#x02BC;s bless&shy;ing on you. Fear God, for He knows all the se&shy;crets of your heart.
    <sup>8</sup>&#8239;Be&shy;liev&shy;ers, be stead&shy;fast in de&shy;vo&shy;tion to God, as im&shy;par&shy;tial witnesses. Don&#x02BC;t let ha&shy;tred of oth&shy;ers lead you a&shy;way from jus&shy;tice. Be just: that is nearer to pi&shy;e&shy;ty.
    <sup>9</sup>&#8239;God has prom&shy;ised for&shy;give&shy;ness and a great re&shy;ward to those who be&shy;lieve and do good works.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>5:35</sup>&#8239;Be&shy;liev&shy;ers, fear God, seek ways to come clos&shy;er to Him, and strive in His cause that you may pros&shy;per.

<p>
    <sup>5:38</sup>&#8239;Cut off the hands of thieves as rec&shy;om&shy;pense for what they have done: a de&shy;ter&shy;rent from God.
    <sup>39</sup>&#8239;But who&shy;ev&shy;er re&shy;pents af&shy;ter his crime, and makes a&shy;mends, God will ac&shy;cept his re&shy;pent&shy;ance, for God is for&shy;giv&shy;ing and mer&shy;ci&shy;ful.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>5:44</sup>&#8239;We re&shy;vealed the Torah containing guid&shy;ance and light.
    <sup>45</sup>&#8239;In it we or&shy;dained a life for a life, an eye for an eye, and sim&shy;i&shy;lar ret&shy;ri&shy;bu&shy;tion for wounds. But if any&shy;one forgoes this out of char&shy;i&shy;ty, it is an a&shy;tone&shy;ment for him&shy;self.  Those who do not judge by what God has re&shy;vealed are the wrong&shy;do&shy;ers.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>5:48</sup>&#8239;Muhammad, We re&shy;vealed to you this Book with the truth, confirming the scrip&shy;tures that came be&shy;fore it.  To each of you, We have pre&shy;scribed a law and a clear path. Had God wanted it, He would have made you all a sin&shy;gle com&shy;mu&shy;ni&shy;ty, but He wanted to test you in what He has giv&shy;en you, so race to do good. You will all re&shy;turn to God, then He will clar&shy;i&shy;fy your dif&shy;fer&shy;ences.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>5:57</sup>&#8239;Be&shy;liev&shy;ers, don&#x02BC;t take al&shy;lies who view your re&shy;li&shy;gion with rid&shy;i&shy;cule and a&shy;muse&shy;ment.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>5:89</sup>&#8239;God will not pun&shy;ish you for your thought&shy;less oaths, on&shy;ly for your de&shy;lib&shy;er&shy;ate oaths. The a&shy;tone&shy;ment for break&shy;ing an oath is to feed ten poor peo&shy;ple as you would feed your own fam&shy;i&shy;ly, or to clothe them, or to free a slave. If you can&#x02BC;t af&shy;ford it, fast for three days. That is the a&shy;tone&shy;ment for bro&shy;ken oaths, but keep your oaths.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>5:90</sup>&#8239;Be&shy;liev&shy;ers: in&shy;tox&shy;i&shy;cants, gambling, i&shy;dol&shy;a&shy;try, and div&shy;i&shy;na&shy;tion are a&shy;bom&shy;i&shy;na&shy;tions from Satan. A&shy;void them so that you may pros&shy;per.
    <sup>91</sup>&#8239;Satan on&shy;ly wants to use in&shy;tox&shy;i&shy;cants and gambling to cause en&shy;mi&shy;ty and ha&shy;tred a&shy;mong you, and to hind&shy;er you from remembering God and pray&shy;er. So will you quit?

    <sup>6:7</sup>&#8239;Muhammad, e&shy;ven if We had sent down to you a mes&shy;sage writ&shy;ten on pa&shy;per, and the dis&shy;be&shy;liev&shy;ers had tou&shy;ched it with their hands, they would have said, <q>This is noth&shy;ing but ob&shy;vi&shy;ous mag&shy;ic!</q>
    <sup>8</sup>&#8239;They say, <q>Why was no an&shy;gel sent down to him?</q> Had We sent down an an&shy;gel, their judg&shy;ment would have come at once, with&shy;out res&shy;pite.
    <sup>9</sup>&#8239;E&shy;ven if We had sent an an&shy;gel, We would have sent him as a man, adding to their con&shy;fu&shy;sion.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>6:48</sup>&#8239;We send the mes&shy;sen&shy;gers on&shy;ly to give good news and to warn. Who&shy;ev&shy;er be&shy;lieves and re&shy;forms will have no fear, nor will they grieve.
    <sup>49</sup>&#8239;But suf&shy;fer&shy;ing af&shy;flicts those who re&shy;ject our mes&shy;sages, be&shy;cause of their de&shy;fi&shy;ant dis&shy;o&shy;be&shy;di&shy;ence.

<p>
    <sup>6:52</sup>&#8239;Don&#x02BC;t send a&shy;way those who call on their Lord morn&shy;ing and eve&shy;ning, seek&shy;ing His face. You are not ac&shy;count&shy;a&shy;ble for them, nor they for you. If you turn them a&shy;way, you be&shy;come one of the un&shy;just.
    <sup>54</sup>&#8239;Your Lord has pre&shy;scribed for Him&shy;self mer&shy;cy: if any of you does wrong out of ig&shy;no&shy;rance, but then re&shy;pents and cor&shy;rects him&shy;self, He is for&shy;giv&shy;ing and mer&shy;ci&shy;ful.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>6:70</sup>&#8239;Leave a&shy;lone those who take play and a&shy;muse&shy;ment as their re&shy;li&shy;gion, and are de&shy;ceived by the life of this world. Re&shy;mind them, lest a soul be de&shy;stroyed for what it has earned, that it will find no pro&shy;tec&shy;tor or in&shy;ter&shy;ces&shy;sor ex&shy;cept God.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>6:108</sup>&#8239;Don&#x02BC;t re&shy;vile those whom i&shy;dol&shy;a&shy;ters call up&shy;on, lest they re&shy;vile God in their spite and ig&shy;no&shy;rance. To eve&shy;ry com&shy;mu&shy;ni&shy;ty We have made its own deeds seem pleas&shy;ing. In the end they will re&shy;turn to their Lord, and He will in&shy;form them of all they did.

<p>
    <sup>6:120</sup>&#8239;A&shy;void sin, both o&shy;pen and se&shy;cret, for those who sin will be repaid for what they&#x02BC;ve done.

</p>

<p>
    <sup>6:141</sup>&#8239;Don&#x02BC;t be ex&shy;ces&shy;sive, for God dis&shy;likes the waste&shy;ful.

</p>

<p>
    <sup>6:151</sup>&#8239;Don&#x02BC;t as&shy;cribe any e&shy;quals with God. Be good to your par&shy;ents.

Don&#x02BC;t ap&shy;proach shame&shy;ful deeds, wheth&shy;er o&shy;pen or se&shy;cret. Don&#x02BC;t take the life that God has made sa&shy;cred, ex&shy;cept by le&shy;gal right.

    <sup>23:1</sup>&#8239;The be&shy;liev&shy;ers are in&shy;deed suc&shy;cess&shy;ful:
    <sup>2</sup>&#8239;those who pray hum&shy;bly,
    <sup>3</sup>&#8239;a&shy;void i&shy;dle talk,
    <sup>4</sup>&#8239;give alms,
    <sup>5</sup>&#8239;guard their chas&shy;ti&shy;ty
    <sup>6</sup>&#8239;(except with their spouses),
    <sup>8</sup>&#8239;who are at&shy;ten&shy;tive to their trusts and prom&shy;ises,
    <sup>9</sup>&#8239;and guard their pray&shy;ers.
    <sup>11</sup>&#8239;These will in&shy;her&shy;it Par&shy;a&shy;dise and live there for&shy;ev&shy;er.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>23:44</sup>&#8239;We sent our mes&shy;sen&shy;gers one af&shy;ter an&shy;oth&shy;er. Eve&shy;ry time a com&shy;mu&shy;ni&shy;ty&#x02BC;s mes&shy;sen&shy;ger ar&shy;rived, they de&shy;nied him. So We let them fol&shy;low each oth&shy;er to de&shy;struc&shy;tion and they be&shy;came cau&shy;tion&shy;ar&shy;y ta&shy;les.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>23:68</sup>&#8239;Have they nev&shy;er con&shy;tem&shy;plat&shy;ed the word of God? Has some&shy;thing new come to them that didn&#x02BC;t come to their fore&shy;fa&shy;thers?
    <sup>69</sup>&#8239;Do they de&shy;ny their Mes&shy;sen&shy;ger be&shy;cause they don&#x02BC;t rec&shy;og&shy;nize him?
    <sup>70</sup>&#8239;Do they say, <q>He is pos&shy;sessed</q>? No, he brought them the truth and most of them hate it.
    <sup>71</sup>&#8239;If truth had fol&shy;lowed their de&shy;sires, the heav&shy;ens, the earth, and eve&shy;ry&shy;thing that lives in them would be ru&shy;ined. We sent them a reminder, but they turn a&shy;way from it.

    <sup>24:27</sup>&#8239;Be&shy;liev&shy;ers, be&shy;fore entering an&shy;oth&shy;er per&shy;son&#x02BC;s house, ask per&shy;mis&shy;sion and greet its oc&shy;cu&shy;pants.
    <sup>28</sup>&#8239;E&shy;ven if no one is in the house, wait un&shy;til you re&shy;ceive per&shy;mis&shy;sion. If you are told, <q>Go a&shy;way,</q> do so.  God is a&shy;ware of all that you do.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>24:30</sup>&#8239;Tell believing men to low&shy;er their gaze and guard their pri&shy;vate parts.
    <sup>31</sup>&#8239;Tell believing wom&shy;en to low&shy;er their gaze and guard their pri&shy;vate parts, to cov&shy;er their breasts, and not to stamp their feet to draw at&shy;ten&shy;tion to what is hid&shy;den.

<p>
    <sup>25:7</sup>&#8239;They say, <q>What sort of a mes&shy;sen&shy;ger is this? He eats food and walks through the mar&shy;ket&shy;place. Why wasn&#x02BC;t an an&shy;gel sent down to help him warn?
    <sup>8</sup>&#8239;Why hasn&#x02BC;t he been giv&shy;en treas&shy;ure, or a gar&shy;den to feed him? The man you fol&shy;low is simp&shy;ly be&shy;witched.</q>
    <sup>9</sup>&#8239;They&#x02BC;ve gone a&shy;stray and can&#x02BC;t find the right path.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>25:20</sup>&#8239;Muhammad, all the mes&shy;sen&shy;gers We sent be&shy;fore you were al&shy;so men who ate food and walked through the mar&shy;ket&shy;place. We&#x02BC;ve made some peo&shy;ple a test for oth&shy;ers. Will you have pa&shy;tience? Your Lord sees eve&shy;ry&shy;thing.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>25:27</sup>&#8239;On that Day the wrong&shy;do&shy;er will bite his hand and say, <q>If on&shy;ly I had tak&shy;en the same path as the Mes&shy;sen&shy;ger!
    <sup>28</sup>&#8239;Woe is me! If on&shy;ly I had not tak&shy;en so-and-so as a friend!
    <sup>29</sup>&#8239;He lead me a&shy;way from the Reminder af&shy;ter it came to me. Satan al&shy;ways be&shy;trays man&shy;kind.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>25:32</sup>&#8239;Dis&shy;be&shy;liev&shy;ers say, <q>Why isn&#x02BC;t the Qur&#x02BC;an re&shy;vealed to him all at once?</q> This is to strength&shy;en your heart. We have re&shy;vealed it grad&shy;u&shy;al&shy;ly, in stages.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>25:47</sup>&#8239;He makes the night as cloth&shy;ing for you, sleep as rest, and the day like a res&shy;ur&shy;rec&shy;tion.
    <sup>48</sup>&#8239;He sends the winds as mes&shy;sen&shy;gers of good news be&shy;fore His mer&shy;cy. We send down pure wa&shy;ter from the sky
    <sup>49</sup>&#8239;to re&shy;vive a dead land and as a drink for our cre&shy;a&shy;tions: an&shy;i&shy;mals and men in great num&shy;bers.
    <sup>50</sup>&#8239;We have re&shy;peat&shy;ed this man&shy;y times a&shy;mong them as a reminder, but most re&shy;main un&shy;grate&shy;ful.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>25:56</sup>&#8239;Muhammad, We have on&shy;ly sent you to de&shy;liv&shy;er good news and a warn&shy;ing.
    <sup>57</sup>&#8239;Say, <q>The on&shy;ly pay&shy;ment I ask for it is that who&shy;ev&shy;er wishes takes a path to his Lord.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>25:63</sup>&#8239;The serv&shy;ants of the Most Gra&shy;cious are those who walk hum&shy;bly on the earth, and when fools ad&shy;dress them, they re&shy;ply, <q>Peace;</q>
    <sup>67</sup>&#8239;those who, when they spend, are nei&shy;ther ex&shy;trav&shy;a&shy;gant nor sting&shy;y, but mod&shy;er&shy;ate be&shy;tween those ex&shy;tremes;
    <sup>68</sup>&#8239;those who nev&shy;er in&shy;voke a de&shy;i&shy;ty be&shy;side God, nor take a life which God has made sa&shy;cred, nor com&shy;mit for&shy;ni&shy;ca&shy;tion.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>25:70</sup>&#8239;God will change evil in&shy;to good for him who re&shy;pents, be&shy;lieves, and does good deeds. God is for&shy;giv&shy;ing and mer&shy;ci&shy;ful.
    <sup>71</sup>&#8239;Who&shy;ev&shy;er re&shy;pents and does good has turned to&shy;wards God with true re&shy;pent&shy;ance.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>25:72</sup>&#8239;Serv&shy;ants of God are those who give no false wit&shy;ness and  pass by fri&shy;vol&shy;i&shy;ty with dig&shy;ni&shy;ty;
    <sup>73</sup>&#8239;those who don&#x02BC;t ig&shy;nore their Lord&#x02BC;s mes&shy;sages when re&shy;minded of them;
    <sup>74</sup>&#8239;and those who pray, <q>Our Lord, give us joy in our wives and chil&shy;dren, and let us be ex&shy;am&shy;ples to the right&shy;eous.</q>
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>28:50</sup>&#8239;Who is fur&shy;ther a&shy;stray than one who fol&shy;lows his own de&shy;sires with&shy;out guid&shy;ance from God? In&shy;deed, God doesn&#x02BC;t guide wrong&shy;do&shy;ers.
    <sup>51</sup>&#8239;We have con&shy;veyed the Word to them, so they may re&shy;mem&shy;ber.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>28:54</sup>&#8239;Those who be&shy;lieve the Scrip&shy;tures will be re&shy;warded dou&shy;ble, be&shy;cause they are stead&shy;fast, re&shy;pel evil with good, give out of what We have giv&shy;en them,
    <sup>55</sup>&#8239;and turn a&shy;way from friv&shy;o&shy;lous speech say&shy;ing, <q>We have our ac&shy;tions and you have yours. Peace be with you. We don&#x02BC;t seek as&shy;so&shy;ci&shy;a&shy;tion with the ig&shy;no&shy;rant.</q>
    <sup>56</sup>&#8239;You can&#x02BC;t guide eve&shy;ry&shy;one you love.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>28:76</sup>&#8239;Qarun had great rich&shy;es. His peo&shy;ple said to him, <q>Don&#x02BC;t gloat, for God doesn&#x02BC;t like gloat&shy;ers.
    <sup>77</sup>&#8239;In&shy;stead, use your wealth to seek the home of the here&shy;af&shy;ter with&shy;out for&shy;get&shy;ting your share in this world. Do good, as God has been good to you. Don&#x02BC;t spread cor&shy;rup&shy;tion in the land, for God doesn&#x02BC;t like those who spread cor&shy;rup&shy;tion.</q>
    <sup>79</sup>&#8239;He went out a&shy;mong the peo&shy;ple in his pomp.  Those who de&shy;sired a world&shy;ly life said, <q>If on&shy;ly we had what Qarun has. He is tru&shy;ly for&shy;tu&shy;nate.</q>
    <sup>80</sup>&#8239;But those with knowl&shy;edge said, <q>Woe to you. God&#x02BC;s re&shy;ward is bet&shy;ter for those who be&shy;lieve and do good. On&shy;ly the stead&shy;fast will at&shy;tain it.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>28:84</sup>&#8239;Who&shy;ev&shy;er does good will re&shy;ceive some&shy;thing bet&shy;ter, but who&shy;ev&shy;er does evil will on&shy;ly be pun&shy;ished for what he has done.
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>29:7</sup>&#8239;For those who be&shy;lieve and do good deeds, We will blot out all their evil and re&shy;ward them ac&shy;cord&shy;ing to their best deeds.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>29:8</sup>&#8239;We have com&shy;manded man to treat his par&shy;ents with kind&shy;ness, but if they try to make you wor&shy;ship gods be&shy;side Me, dis&shy;o&shy;bey them. You will all re&shy;turn to me, and I&#x02BC;ll tell you the truth a&shy;bout eve&shy;ry&shy;thing you&#x02BC;ve done.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>29:10</sup>&#8239;Some men say, <q>We be&shy;lieve in God,</q> but when they suf&shy;fer for His cause, they con&shy;sid&shy;er per&shy;se&shy;cu&shy;tion from men as if it were God&#x02BC;s pun&shy;ish&shy;ment. If help co&shy;mes to you from your Lord, they say, <q>We&#x02BC;ve al&shy;ways been with you.</q> God knows best what is in eve&shy;ry&shy;one&#x02BC;s heart.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>29:45</sup>&#8239;Pray&shy;er re&shy;strains im&shy;mor&shy;al and un&shy;just be&shy;hav&shy;ior.
    <sup>46</sup>&#8239;Don&#x02BC;t ar&shy;gue with fol&shy;low&shy;ers of ear&shy;li&shy;er rev&shy;e&shy;la&shy;tion, but say, <q>We be&shy;lieve in what was re&shy;vealed to us and in what was re&shy;vealed to you. Our God and your God are the same. We all bow to Him.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>29:57</sup>&#8239;Eve&shy;ry&shy;one will taste death, then re&shy;turn to Us.
    <sup>58</sup>&#8239;To them who be&shy;lieve and do good, We will give man&shy;sions to live in for&shy;ev&shy;er in a par&shy;a&shy;dise with flow&shy;ing riv&shy;ers. The re&shy;ward is ex&shy;cel&shy;lent for those who la&shy;bor,
    <sup>59</sup>&#8239;are stead&shy;fast, and trust in their Lord.
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>30:21</sup>&#8239;A&shy;mong His signs is this: He cre&shy;at&shy;ed spouses for you that you may live in tran&shy;quil&shy;i&shy;ty with them.  He put love and mer&shy;cy be&shy;tween you. In&shy;deed, there are signs in this for those who re&shy;flect.
    <sup>22</sup>&#8239;A&shy;mong His signs is the cre&shy;a&shy;tion of the heav&shy;ens and the earth, and the di&shy;ver&shy;si&shy;ty of your lan&shy;guages and your col&shy;ors.  In&shy;deed, in that are signs for those who know.
    <sup>23</sup>&#8239;A&shy;mong His signs is your sleep, by night and day, and your quest for some of His boun&shy;ty.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>30:33</sup>&#8239;When men en&shy;coun&shy;ter trou&shy;ble, they cry to their Lord and turn to Him for help, but as soon as He gives them a taste of mer&shy;cy, some of them wor&shy;ship gods be&shy;side Him,
    <sup>34</sup>&#8239;show&shy;ing in&shy;grat&shy;i&shy;tude for what We gave them.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>30:36</sup>&#8239;When We give men a taste of mer&shy;cy, they re&shy;joice, but when evil af&shy;flicts them be&shy;cause of their own ac&shy;tions, they des&shy;pair.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>30:38</sup>&#8239;Give what is due to rel&shy;a&shy;tives, the needy, and the trav&shy;el&shy;er. That is best for those who seek God&#x02BC;s coun&shy;te&shy;nance, and they will pros&shy;per.
    <sup>39</sup>&#8239;What&shy;ev&shy;er you lend in u&shy;su&shy;ry, to in&shy;crease through the prop&shy;er&shy;ty of oth&shy;ers, has no in&shy;crease with God, but what&shy;ev&shy;er you give in char&shy;i&shy;ty, seek&shy;ing God&#x02BC;s coun&shy;te&shy;nance, will in&shy;crease re&shy;peat&shy;ed&shy;ly.
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>31:4</sup>&#8239;Those who are stead&shy;fast in pray&shy;er, spend in char&shy;i&shy;ty, and are cer&shy;tain of the here&shy;af&shy;ter,
    <sup>5</sup>&#8239;are guid&shy;ed by their Lord and will pros&shy;per.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>31:14</sup>&#8239;We have com&shy;manded man to be good to his par&shy;ents. His moth&shy;er car&shy;ried him in weak&shy;ness, and it took two years to wean him. Be grate&shy;ful to Me and your par&shy;ents.
    <sup>15</sup>&#8239;But if they try to make you as&shy;so&shy;ci&shy;ate oth&shy;ers with Me, dis&shy;o&shy;bey them. Yet ac&shy;com&shy;pa&shy;ny them in this life with kind&shy;ness, and fol&shy;low the path of those who turn to me. You will all re&shy;turn to Me in the end, and I will tell you the truth a&shy;bout all you did.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>31:17</sup>&#8239;Be stead&shy;fast in pray&shy;er, en&shy;join what is right, for&shy;bid what is wrong, and pa&shy;tient&shy;ly bear what&shy;ev&shy;er hap&shy;pens to you: as&shy;pire to these things.
    <sup>18</sup>&#8239;Don&#x02BC;t turn a&shy;way from men in pride, nor walk ar&shy;ro&shy;gant&shy;ly through the earth, for God dis&shy;likes the ar&shy;ro&shy;gant and boast&shy;ful.
    <sup>19</sup>&#8239;Be mod&shy;er&shy;ate in your pa&shy;ce and low&shy;er your voice, for the ugliest sound is the braying of as&shy;ses.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>31:32</sup>&#8239;When waves cov&shy;er them like a can&shy;o&shy;py, they call to God, of&shy;fer&shy;ing Him sin&shy;cere de&shy;vo&shy;tion. But once He has safe&shy;ly de&shy;liv&shy;ered them to land, some of them wav&shy;er.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>33:35</sup>&#8239;God has pre&shy;pared for&shy;give&shy;ness and a great re&shy;ward for those who are de&shy;vot&shy;ed to God, for the be&shy;liev&shy;ers, the de&shy;vout, the hon&shy;est, the stead&shy;fast, the hum&shy;ble, the char&shy;i&shy;ta&shy;ble, those who fast, the chaste, and those who fre&shy;quent&shy;ly re&shy;mem&shy;ber God.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>33:54</sup>&#8239;God has full knowl&shy;edge of eve&shy;ry&shy;thing, wheth&shy;er you re&shy;veal or con&shy;ceal it.

<p>
    <sup>34:37</sup>&#8239;Nei&shy;ther wealth nor chil&shy;dren will bring you nearer to Us: on&shy;ly faith and right&shy;eous&shy;ness.
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>35:45</sup>&#8239;If God im&shy;me&shy;di&shy;ate&shy;ly pun&shy;ished men for their wrong&shy;do&shy;ing, He wouldn&#x02BC;t leave a sin&shy;gle crea&shy;ture on the earth. How&shy;ev&shy;er, He de&shy;fers for a stat&shy;ed time.
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>39:7</sup>&#8239;If you are un&shy;grate&shy;ful, God has no need of you. He dis&shy;likes in&shy;grat&shy;i&shy;tude in His serv&shy;ants. If you are grate&shy;ful, He is pleased with you. No one will bear an&shy;oth&shy;er&#x02BC;s bur&shy;den. You will re&shy;turn to your Lord in the end, and He will in&shy;form you a&shy;bout what you did. He knows what is in men&#x02BC;s hearts.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>39:10</sup>&#8239;Those who do good in this world re&shy;ceive a good re&shy;ward. The pa&shy;tient will re&shy;ceive a re&shy;ward with&shy;out meas&shy;ure.

</p>

<p>
    <sup>39:69</sup>&#8239;The earth will shine with the light of its Lord, the rec&shy;ord of deeds will be o&shy;pened, the proph&shy;ets and witnesses will be brought for&shy;ward, and fair judg&shy;ment pro&shy;nounced be&shy;tween them. They will not be wronged.
    <sup>70</sup>&#8239;Eve&shy;ry man will be paid in full for his ac&shy;tions.
    <sup>71</sup>&#8239;Dis&shy;be&shy;liev&shy;ers will be led to Hell in crowds.

<p>
    <sup>40:55</sup>&#8239;Be pa&shy;tient, for God&#x02BC;s prom&shy;ise is true.  Ask for&shy;give&shy;ness for your sins, and praise your Lord eve&shy;ning and morn&shy;ing.
    <sup>56</sup>&#8239;Those who dis&shy;pute God&#x02BC;s mes&shy;sages with&shy;out au&shy;thor&shy;i&shy;ty have hearts full of pride, which they will nev&shy;er sat&shy;is&shy;fy. Seek ref&shy;uge in God.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>40:61</sup>&#8239;God made the night for you, so that you may rest. He made the day to help you see. God is boun&shy;ti&shy;ful to&shy;wards men, but most men give no thanks.

    <sup>34</sup>&#8239;Re&shy;pel evil with some&shy;thing bet&shy;ter, then your en&shy;e&shy;my will be&shy;come like a close friend.
    <sup>36</sup>&#8239;If whis&shy;pers from Satan stir you up, seek ref&shy;uge in God.

<p>
    <sup>41:49</sup>&#8239;Man nev&shy;er tires of asking for good things, but if evil touches him, he gives up all hope and is lost in des&shy;pair.
    <sup>50</sup>&#8239;When we let him taste mer&shy;cy af&shy;ter ad&shy;ver&shy;si&shy;ty, he is sure to say, <q>This is due to my mer&shy;it.

    <sup>42:13</sup>&#8239;He has es&shy;tab&shy;lished the same re&shy;li&shy;gion for you that He gave to No&shy;ah, Abraham, Mo&shy;ses, and Jesus: up&shy;hold the faith, and make no fac&shy;tions there&shy;in.

    <sup>42:27</sup>&#8239;If God were to grant a&shy;bun&shy;dant pro&shy;vi&shy;sion to His serv&shy;ants, they would mis&shy;be&shy;have; but he sends down in due meas&shy;ure what He pleases. He knows His serv&shy;ants and watches o&shy;ver them.

    <sup>42:36</sup>&#8239;What you&#x02BC;ve been giv&shy;en is for tem&shy;po&shy;rar&shy;y en&shy;joy&shy;ment in this life. What is with God is bet&shy;ter and more last&shy;ing for those who be&shy;lieve and trust in their Lord;
