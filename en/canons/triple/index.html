    <p>
    <sup>1:1</sup>&#8239;The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the son of God.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>1:2</sup>&#8239;As it is written in Isaiah the prophet, <q>Behold, I send my messenger ahead of you, who will prepare your way.</q>
    <sup>3</sup>&#8239;<q>A voice of one calling in the wilderness, <q>Prepare the way for the Lord. Make his paths straight.</q></q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>1:4</sup>&#8239;John the Baptist appeared in the wilderness, preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins.
    <sup>5</sup>&#8239;All the countryside of Judea and all the people of Jerusalem were going out to him and were being baptized by him in the river Jordan, confessing their sins.
    <sup>6</sup>&#8239;John was clothed with camel&#x02BC;s hair, and wore a leather belt around his waist, and ate locusts and wild honey.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>1:7</sup>&#8239;And he preached, saying, <q>After me comes he who is mightier than I. I&#x02BC;m not worthy to stoop down and untie the strap of his sandals.
    <sup>8</sup>&#8239;I baptized you with water, but he&#x02BC;ll baptize you with the holy spirit.</q>
</p>


<hr class="scene" />

<p>
    <sup>1:9</sup>&#8239;In those days Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan.
    <sup>10</sup>&#8239;Just as he was coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens being torn open and the spirit descending on him like a dove.
    <sup>11</sup>&#8239;And a voice came out of the heavens, <q>You are my beloved son; with you I am well pleased.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>1:12</sup>&#8239;Immediately the spirit drove him into the wilderness,
    <sup>13</sup>&#8239;and he was in the wilderness forty days, being tempted by the tempter. He was with the wild animals, and the angels ministered to him.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>1:14</sup>&#8239;After John was arrested, Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the gospel of God,
    <sup>15</sup>&#8239;and saying, <q>The time is fulfilled, and God&#x02BC;s kingdom is at hand. Repent and believe in the gospel.</q>
</p>


<hr class="scene" />

<p>
    <sup>1:16</sup>&#8239;Walking along by the Sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew the brother of Simon casting a net into the sea, for they were fishermen.
    <sup>17</sup>&#8239;Jesus said to them, <q>Come, follow me, and I&#x02BC;ll make you become fishers of men.</q>
    <sup>18</sup>&#8239;Immediately they left the nets, and followed him.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>1:19</sup>&#8239;Going on a little farther, he saw James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, who were in the boat mending their nets.
    <sup>20</sup>&#8239;Immediately he called them, and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired servants, and followed him.
</p>


<hr class="scene" />

<p>
    <sup>1:29</sup>&#8239;They entered the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>1:30</sup>&#8239;Now Simon&#x02BC;s mother-in-law lay sick with a fever, and immediately they told him about her.
    <sup>31</sup>&#8239;He came, took her by the hand, and helped her up. The fever left her, and she began to wait on them.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>1:32</sup>&#8239;That evening, after the sun had set, they brought to him all who were sick and possessed by demons.
    <sup>33</sup>&#8239;The whole city gathered together at the door.
    <sup>34</sup>&#8239;He healed many who were sick with various diseases, and cast out many demons. He would not allow the demons to speak, because they knew him.
    <sup>39</sup>&#8239;And he went into their synagogues throughout all Galilee, preaching and casting out demons.
</p>


<hr class="scene" />

<p>
    <sup>1:40</sup>&#8239;A leper came to him, begging him, and kneeling said to him, <q>If you&#x02BC;re willing, you can make me clean.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>1:41</sup>&#8239;Moved with compassion, he reached out his hand, and touched him, and said to him, <q>I am willing. Be clean.</q>
    <sup>42</sup>&#8239;Im&shy;me&shy;di&shy;ate&shy;ly the leprosy left him, and he was cleansed.
    <sup>43</sup>&#8239;Jesus sent him away at once and sternly warned him,
    <sup>44</sup>&#8239;telling him, <q>See that you say nothing to anyone, but go show yourself to the priest and offer for your cleansing what Moses commanded, as a testimony to them.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>1:45</sup>&#8239;But he went out and began to talk freely about it, spreading the news, so that Jesus could no longer enter a city publicly, but stayed out in deserted places, and people came to him from everywhere.
</p>


<hr class="scene" />

<p>
    <sup>2:1</sup>&#8239;When he returned to Capernaum some days later, people heard that he was at home.
    <sup>2</sup>&#8239;And many were gathered together, so that there was no more room for them, not even near the door. And he preached the word to them.
    <sup>3</sup>&#8239;They came, bringing to him a paralytic, carried by four of them.
    <sup>4</sup>&#8239;And when they could not come near him because of the crowd, they removed the roof above him, made an opening, and let down the mat on which the paralytic was lying.
    <sup>5</sup>&#8239;When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralytic, <q>Son, your sins are forgiven.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:6</sup>&#8239;But some of the scribes were sitting there, thinking to themselves,
    <sup>7</sup>&#8239;<q>Why does he talk like that? He&#x02BC;s blaspheming. Who can forgive sins but God alone?</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:8</sup>&#8239;Im&shy;me&shy;di&shy;ate&shy;ly Jesus perceived in his spirit that they were thinking like this, and said to them, <q>Why do you question these things in your hearts?
    <sup>9</sup>&#8239;Which is easier, to say to the paralytic, <q>Your sins are forgiven</q>, or to say, <q>Rise, pick up your mat, and walk?</q>
    <sup>10</sup>&#8239;But that you may know that the son of man has authority on earth to forgive sins</q>, he said to the paralytic,
    <sup>11</sup>&#8239;<q>I tell you, Rise, pick up your mat, and go home.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:12</sup>&#8239;He got up, immediately picked up the mat, and went out in front of them all, so that they were all amazed, and glorified God, saying, <q>We&#x02BC;ve never seen anything like this.</q>
</p>


<hr class="scene" />

<p>
    <sup>2:13</sup>&#8239;He went out again beside the sea, and all the crowd came to him, and he taught them.
    <sup>14</sup>&#8239;As he passed by, he saw Levi the son of Alphaeus sitting in the tax booth, and he said to him, <q>Follow me.</q> He got up and followed him.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:15</sup>&#8239;As he reclined at the table in his house, many tax collectors and sinners reclined with Jesus and his disciples, for there were many who followed him.
    <sup>16</sup>&#8239;Wh&shy;en the scribes of the Pharisees saw that he was eating with sinners and tax collectors, they asked his disciples, <q>Why does he eat with tax collectors and sinners?</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:17</sup>&#8239;When Jesus heard it, he said to them, <q>Those who are healthy don&#x02BC;t need a doctor, but those who are sick. I didn&#x02BC;t come to call the righteous, but sinners.</q>
</p>


<hr class="scene" />

<p>
    <sup>2:18</sup>&#8239;John&#x02BC;s disciples and the Pharisees were fasting.  Some people came and asked him, <q>Why do John&#x02BC;s disciples and the disciples of the Pharisees fast, but your disciples don&#x02BC;t fast?</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:19</sup>&#8239;Jesus said to them, <q>Can wedding guests fast while the groom is with them? As long as they have the groom with them, they can&#x02BC;t fast.
    <sup>20</sup>&#8239;The days will come, when the groom is taken away from them, and then they will fast in that day.</q>
</p>


<hr class="scene" />

<p>
    <sup>2:23</sup>&#8239;One Sabbath he was going through the grainfields, and his disciples began to pluck some heads of grain as they went.
    <sup>24</sup>&#8239;The Pharisees said to him, <q>Look. Why are they doing what&#x02BC;s unlawful on the Sabbath?</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:25</sup>&#8239;He said to them, <q>Haven&#x02BC;t you read what David did when he and his companions were in need and hungry?
    <sup>26</sup>&#8239;He entered the house of God, when Abiathar was high priest, and ate the consecrated bread, which is only lawful for the priests to eat, and he also gave some to his companions.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:27</sup>&#8239;He said to them, <q>The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath.
    <sup>28</sup>&#8239;So the son of man is lord even of the Sabbath.</q>
</p>


<hr class="scene" />

<p>
    <sup>3:1</sup>&#8239;He entered the synagogue again, and a man with a withered hand was there.
    <sup>2</sup>&#8239;They watched Jesus to see if he would heal him on the Sabbath, so that they might accuse him.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>3:3</sup>&#8239;He said to the man with the withered hand, <q>Come forward.</q>
    <sup>4</sup>&#8239;He asked them, <q>Is it lawful on the Sabbath to do good or to do harm, to save life or to kill?</q> But they were silent.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>3:5</sup>&#8239;He looked around at them with anger, grieved at the hardness of their hearts, and said to the man, <q>Stretch out your hand.</q> He stretched it out, and his hand was restored.
    <sup>6</sup>&#8239;The Pharisees went out and immediately held counsel with the Herodians against him, how to destroy him.
</p>


<hr class="scene" />

<p>
    <sup>3:7</sup>&#8239;Jesus withdrew with his disciples to the sea, and a large crowd followed him from Galilee, Judea,
    <sup>8</sup>&#8239;Jerusalem, Idumea, beyond the Jordan, and around Tyre and Sidon. Hearing the great things he did, a large crowd came to him.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>3:9</sup>&#8239;Because of the crowd, he told his disciples to have a boat wait for him, so they wouldn&#x02BC;t crush him.
    <sup>10</sup>&#8239;Since he had healed so many, everyone who had diseases pressed around him to touch him.
    <sup>11</sup>&#8239;Whenever the unclean spirits saw him, they fell down in front of him, and cried out, <q>You are the son of God.</q>
    <sup>12</sup>&#8239;And he sternly ordered them not to make him known.
</p>


<hr class="scene" />

<p>
    <sup>3:13</sup>&#8239;He went up on the mountain and summoned those he wanted, and they came to him.
    <sup>14</sup>&#8239;He appointed twelve, whom he also named apostles, to be with him, and to send them out to preach,
    <sup>15</sup>&#8239;and to have authority to cast out demons.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>3:16</sup>&#8239;He appointed the twelve: Simon (whom he named Peter);
    <sup>17</sup>&#8239;James the son of Zebedee, and John the brother of James (he named them Boanerges, meaning sons of thunder);
    <sup>18</sup>&#8239;Andrew, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, James the son of Alphaeus, Thaddaeus, Simon the Zealot,
    <sup>19</sup>&#8239;and Judas Iscariot, who betrayed him.
</p>


<hr class="scene" />

<p>
    <sup>3:22</sup>&#8239;The scribes who came down from Jerusalem said, <q>He casts out demons by the prince of demons.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>3:23</sup>&#8239;He called them over to him, and said to them in parables, <q>How can the tempter cast out the tempter?
    <sup>24</sup>&#8239;If a kingdom is divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand.
    <sup>25</sup>&#8239;If a house is divided against itself, that house will not be able to stand.
    <sup>26</sup>&#8239;If the tempter has risen up against himself, and is divided, he cannot stand, but is finished.
    <sup>27</sup>&#8239;No one can enter a strong man&#x02BC;s house, and plunder his goods, unless he first ties up the strong man, and then he can plunder his house.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>3:28</sup>&#8239;<q>Truly I say to you, the sons of men will be forgiven all sins and whatever blasphemies they speak,
    <sup>29</sup>&#8239;but whoever blasphemes against the holy spirit will never be forgiven, but is guilty of an eternal sin,</q>
    <sup>30</sup>&#8239;because they said, <q>He has an unclean spirit.</q>
</p>


<hr class="scene" />

<p>
    <sup>3:31</sup>&#8239;His mother and his brothers came. Standing outside, they sent word to him, calling him.
    <sup>32</sup>&#8239;A crowd was sitting around him, and said to him, <q>Your mother and brothers are outside looking for you.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>3:33</sup>&#8239;He answered them, <q>Who are my mother and my brothers?</q>
    <sup>34</sup>&#8239;Looking at those seated around him, he said, <q>Here are my mother and my brothers.
    <sup>35</sup>&#8239;Who&shy;ev&shy;er does the will of God, he is my brother and sister and mother.</q>
</p>


<hr class="scene" />

<p>
    <sup>4:1</sup>&#8239;He began to teach by the sea again. A very great crowd gathered around him, so he got into a boat on the sea and sat down.  The whole crowd was by the sea on the land.
    <sup>2</sup>&#8239;He taught them many things in parables, and in his teaching said to them,
</p>

<p>
    <sup>4:3</sup>&#8239;<q>Listen. A sower went out to sow.
    <sup>4</sup>&#8239;As he sowed, some seed fell along the path, and the birds came and devoured it.
    <sup>5</sup>&#8239;Other seed fell on rocky ground, where it had little soil.  It sprang up quickly, because it had no depth of soil.
    <sup>6</sup>&#8239;When the sun rose, it was scorched. Because it had no root, it withered away.
    <sup>7</sup>&#8239;Other seed fell among thorns. The thorns grew up, and choked it, and it produced no grain.
    <sup>8</sup>&#8239;Other seed fell on good soil. It grew up, increased, and produced grain, bringing forth thirty, sixty, and a hundredfold.</q>
    <sup>9</sup>&#8239;He who has ears to hear, let him hear.</p>

)
<p>
    <sup>4:10</sup>&#8239;When he was alone, those a&shy;rou&shy;nd him with the twelve asked him about the parables.
    <sup>11</sup>&#8239;He said to them, <q>The secret of God&#x02BC;s kingdom is given to you, but to those outside everything is in parables.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>4:13</sup>&#8239;He said to them, <q>Don&#x02BC;t you know this parable? Then how will you understand all the parables?
    <sup>14</sup>&#8239;The sower sows the word.
    <sup>15</sup>&#8239;These are the ones along the path, where the word is sown.  When they hear, immediately the tempter comes, and takes away the word sown in them.
    <sup>16</sup>&#8239;These are the ones sown on rocky ground. When they hear the word, they immediately receive it with joy,
    <sup>17</sup>&#8239;but they have no root in themselves, and endure briefly.  When trouble or persecution comes because of the word, they immediately fall away.
    <sup>18</sup>&#8239;These are the ones sown among thorns. When they hear the word,
    <sup>19</sup>&#8239;the worries of the world, the deceitfulness of riches, and the desire for other things enter in and choke the word, and it becomes unfruitful.
    <sup>20</sup>&#8239;These are the ones sown on good soil. They hear the word, accept it, and bear fruit: thirty, sixty, and a hundredfold.</q>
</p>


<hr class="scene" />

<p>
    <sup>4:21</sup>&#8239;He said to them, <q>Is a lamp brought in to be put under a basket, or under a bed, and not on a stand?
    <sup>22</sup>&#8239;Nothing is hidden that will not be revealed, and nothing is secret that will not come to light.
    <sup>23</sup>&#8239;If anyone has ears to hear, let him hear.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>4:24</sup>&#8239;He said to them, <q>Pay attention to what you hear. With the measure you use, it will be measured to you, and even more will be added to you.
    <sup>25</sup>&#8239;For whoever has will be given more; and whoever doesn&#x02BC;t have, even what he has will be taken away.</q>
</p>


<hr class="scene" />

<p>
    <sup>4:30</sup>&#8239;He said, <q>With what can we compare God&#x02BC;s kingdom? What parable can we use to describe it?
    <sup>31</sup>&#8239;It&#x02BC;s like a mustard seed. When sown upon the soil, it&#x02BC;s smaller than all other seeds on the ground,
    <sup>32</sup>&#8239;yet when it&#x02BC;s sown, it grows up and becomes larger than all the garden plants, and puts out large branches, so the birds of the air can nest in its shade.</q>
</p>


<hr class="scene" />

<p>
    <sup>4:35</sup>&#8239;That day when evening came, he said to them, <q>Let&#x02BC;s cross to the other side.</q>
    <sup>36</sup>&#8239;Leaving the crowd, they took him with them since he was in the boat; and other boats were with him.
    <sup>37</sup>&#8239;A great windstorm arose, and the waves were br&shy;eak&shy;ing over the boat, so that the boat was already filling up.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>4:38</sup>&#8239;He was in the stern, sleeping on the cushion. They woke him up, and said to him, <q>Teacher, don&#x02BC;t you care that we&#x02BC;re going to die?</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>4:39</sup>&#8239;He woke up, rebuked the wind, and said to the sea, <q>Peace. Be still.</q>  The wind stopped, and there was a great calm.
    <sup>40</sup>&#8239;He said to them, <q>Why are you afraid? Do you still have no faith?</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>4:41</sup>&#8239;They were terrified, and asked each other, <q>Who then is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him?</q>
</p>


<hr class="scene" />

<p>
    <sup>5:1</sup>&#8239;They came to the other side of the sea, to the region of the Gerasenes.
    <sup>2</sup>&#8239;As soon as Jesus got out of the boat, a man with an unclean spirit came out of the tombs and met him.
    <sup>3</sup>&#8239;He lived in the tombs. No one could bind him anymore, not even with a chain,
    <sup>4</sup>&#8239;because he had often been bound with shackles and chains, but had torn the chains apart, and broke the shackles in pieces.  No one was strong enough to subdue him.
    <sup>5</sup>&#8239;Night and day, in the tombs and in the mountains, he was always crying out, and cutting himself with stones.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>5:6</sup>&#8239;When he saw Jesus from a distance, he ran and knelt down in front of him.
    <sup>7</sup>&#8239;He cried out with a loud voice, <q>What do you want with me, Jesus, you son of the most high God? I beg you by God, not to torment me.</q>
    <sup>8</sup>&#8239;For he had said to him, <q>Come out of the man, you unclean spirit.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>5:11</sup>&#8239;There was a large herd of pigs on the hillside, feeding.
    <sup>13</sup>&#8239;So he gave the spirits permission to enter the pigs. The unclean spirits came out, and entered the pigs.  The herd of about two thousand rushed down the steep bank into the sea and drowned.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>5:14</sup>&#8239;The herdsmen fled and told it in the city and the countryside. People came to see what had happened.
    <sup>15</sup>&#8239;They came to Jesus, and saw him who had been possessed with the demons, sitting, clothed, and in his right mind; and they were afraid.
    <sup>16</sup>&#8239;Those who had seen it described to them what had happened to the demon-possessed man and the pigs.
    <sup>17</sup>&#8239;They began to beg Jesus to leave their region.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>5:18</sup>&#8239;As he was entering the boat, the man who had been possessed with demons begged to go with him.
    <sup>19</sup>&#8239;He did not let him, but said to him, <q>Go home to your own people, and tell them how much the Lord has done for you, and how he had mercy on you.</q>
    <sup>20</sup>&#8239;He went away and began to proclaim in Decapolis how much Jesus had done for him. Everyone was amazed.
</p>


<hr class="scene" />

<p>
    <sup>5:21</sup>&#8239;When Jesus had crossed again by boat to the other side, a large crowd gathered around him, and he was by the sea.
    <sup>22</sup>&#8239;One of the synagogue leaders, named Jairus, came. Seeing Jesus, he fell at his feet,
    <sup>23</sup>&#8239;begging him earnestly, <q>My little daughter is dying.  Come and lay your hands on her, so that she will get well, and live.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>5:24</sup>&#8239;He went with him.  A large crowd followed him, and pressed around him.
    <sup>25</sup>&#8239;A woman, bleeding for twelve years,
    <sup>26</sup>&#8239;had suffered much under many doctors, and had spent all she had, and was no better, but rather grew worse.
    <sup>27</sup>&#8239;Having heard about Jesus, she came up behind him in the crowd, and touched his cloak.
    <sup>28</sup>&#8239;For she said, <q>If I can just touch his clothes, I&#x02BC;ll get well.</q>
    <sup>29</sup>&#8239;Im&shy;me&shy;di&shy;ate&shy;ly, the flow of blood dried up. She felt in her body that she was healed of her affliction.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>5:30</sup>&#8239;Jesus realized at once that power had gone out from him, and turned around in the crowd, and said, <q>Who touched my clothes?</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>5:31</sup>&#8239;His disciples said to him, <q>You see the crowd pressing around you, and yet you ask, <q>Who touched me?</q></q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>5:32</sup>&#8239;He looked around to see who had done it.
    <sup>33</sup>&#8239;The woman, fearing and trembling, knowing what had happened to her, came and fell down in front of him, and told him the whole truth.
    <sup>34</sup>&#8239;He said to her, <q>Daughter, your faith has made you well.  Go in peace, and be healed of your affliction.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>5:35</sup>&#8239;While he was still speaking, people came from the synagogue leader&#x02BC;s house and said, <q>Your daughter is dead. Why bother the teacher anymore?</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>5:36</sup>&#8239;Jesus overheard what they said, and told the synagogue leader, <q>Don&#x02BC;t be afraid, just believe.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>5:37</sup>&#8239;He allowed no one to follow him except Peter, James, and John the brother of James.
    <sup>38</sup>&#8239;When they came to the synagogue leader&#x02BC;s house, he saw a commotion, and people weeping and wailing loudly.
    <sup>39</sup>&#8239;He went inside, and asked them, <q>Why are you making a commotion, and weeping? The child isn&#x02BC;t dead but asleep.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>5:40</sup>&#8239;They laughed at him, but he sent them all outside. He took the child&#x02BC;s father and mother and those who were with him, and went in to where the child was.
    <sup>41</sup>&#8239;Taking her by the hand, he said to her, <q>Little girl, I say to you, get up.</q>
    <sup>42</sup>&#8239;Im&shy;me&shy;di&shy;ate&shy;ly the girl got up and began walking (she was twelve years old). They were completely amazed.
    <sup>43</sup>&#8239;He gave them strict orders that no one should know about this, and told them to give her something to eat.
</p>


<hr class="scene" />

<p>
    <sup>6:1</sup>&#8239;He left there, and went to his hometown, and his disciples followed him.
    <sup>2</sup>&#8239;Wh&shy;en the Sabbath came, he began to teach in the synagogue. Many who heard him were astonished, saying, <q>Where did this man get these things? What is this wisdom given to him?  How are such miracles done by his hands?
    <sup>3</sup>&#8239;Isn&#x02BC;t this the carpenter, the son of Mary, and brother of James, and Joses, and Judas, and Simon?  Aren&#x02BC;t his sisters here with us?</q>  And they took offense at him.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>6:4</sup>&#8239;Jesus said to them, <q>A prophet is without honor only in his hometown, am&shy;ong his relatives, and in his own household.</q>
    <sup>5</sup>&#8239;He could do no miracle there, except to lay his hands on a few sick people, and heal them.
    <sup>6</sup>&#8239;He was amazed at their unbelief.
</p>


<hr class="scene" />

<p>
    <sup>6:6</sup>&#8239;He went around the villages teaching.
    <sup>7</sup>&#8239;He summoned the twelve, and began to send them out in pairs. He gave them authority over unclean spirits.
    <sup>8</sup>&#8239;He instructed them to take nothing for their journey except a staff: no bread, no bag, no money in their belts;
    <sup>9</sup>&#8239;but to wear sandals and not a second shirt.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>6:12</sup>&#8239;They went out, and preached that people should repent.
    <sup>13</sup>&#8239;They cast out many demons, anointed many sick people with oil, and healed them.
</p>


<hr class="scene" />

<p>
    <sup>6:14</sup>&#8239;King Herod heard about this, because Jesus&#x02BC;s name had become well kn&shy;own.  Some said, <q>John the Baptist has risen from the dead, and that is why miraculous powers work in him.</q>
    <sup>15</sup>&#8239;Others said, <q>He is Elijah.</q> And others said, <q>He is a prophet, like one of the prophets of old.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>6:16</sup>&#8239;But when Herod heard it, he said, <q>John, whom I beheaded, has risen.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>6:17</sup>&#8239;For Herod had married Herodias, his brother&#x02BC;s wife. He had ordered John to be arrested and bound in prison for her sake.
    <sup>18</sup>&#8239;For John had been telling Herod, <q>It&#x02BC;s not lawful for you to have your brother&#x02BC;s wife.</q>
    <sup>19</sup>&#8239;So Herodias had a grudge against him, and wanted to kill him. But she could not,
    <sup>20</sup>&#8239;because Herod feared John, and kept him safe, knowing that he was a righteous and holy man. When he heard him, he was greatly perplexed, yet he enjoyed listening to him.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>6:21</sup>&#8239;An opportunity came on Herod&#x02BC;s birthday. He hosted a banquet for his nobles, the military commanders, and the leading men of Galilee.
    <sup>22</sup>&#8239;When Herodias&#x02BC;s daughter came in and danced, she pleased Herod and his guests.  The king said to the girl, <q>Ask me for whatever you want, and I&#x02BC;ll give it to you.</q>
    <sup>23</sup>&#8239;He vowed to her, <q>Whatever you ask me, I&#x02BC;ll give you, up to half of my kingdom.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>6:24</sup>&#8239;She went out and asked her mother, <q>What should I ask for?</q> She answered, <q>John the Baptist&#x02BC;s head</q>.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>6:25</sup>&#8239;At once she hurried to the king and said, <q>I want you to give me John the Baptist&#x02BC;s head on a platter right now.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>6:26</sup>&#8239;The king was greatly distressed, but because of his vow and his guests he did not want to refuse her.
    <sup>27</sup>&#8239;Im&shy;me&shy;di&shy;ate&shy;ly the king sent an executioner to bring his head. He went and beheaded him in the prison,
    <sup>28</sup>&#8239;and brought his head on a platter, and gave it to the girl, and the girl gave it to her mother.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>6:29</sup>&#8239;When his disciples heard about it, they came and took his body, and laid it in a tomb.
</p>


<hr class="scene" />

<p>
    <sup>6:32</sup>&#8239;They went away in the boat by themselves to a deserted place.
    <sup>33</sup>&#8239;Many saw them going and recognized them, and ran on foot from all the towns and arrived ahead of them.
    <sup>34</sup>&#8239;When he went ashore, he saw a large crowd, and had compassion on them, because they were like sheep without a shepherd. He began to teach them many things.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>6:35</sup>&#8239;When it grew late, his disciples came to him, and said, <q>This is a desolate place, and it&#x02BC;s getting late.
    <sup>36</sup>&#8239;Send them away to go into the surrounding countryside and villages to buy themselves something to eat.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>6:37</sup>&#8239;He answered, <q>You give them something to eat.</q> They asked him, <q>Should we go and buy two hundred denarii worth of bread, and give it to them to eat?</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>6:38</sup>&#8239;He said to them, <q>How many loaves do you have? Go and see.</q> Once they had found out, they said, <q>Five, and two fish.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>6:39</sup>&#8239;He commanded them all to sit down in groups on the green grass.
    <sup>40</sup>&#8239;They sat down in groups of hundreds and fifties.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>6:41</sup>&#8239;He took the five loaves and the two fish. Looking up to heaven, he blessed and broke the loaves. He gave them to his disciples to set before the people, and divided the two fish among them all.
    <sup>42</sup>&#8239;Eve&shy;ry&shy;one ate and was satisfied.
    <sup>43</sup>&#8239;They picked up twelve baskets full of broken pieces and of fish.
    <sup>44</sup>&#8239;There were five thousand men who ate the loaves.
</p>


<hr class="scene" />

<p>
    <sup>7:1</sup>&#8239;The Pharisees, and some of the scribes who had come from Jerusalem, gathered around him,
    <sup>2</sup>&#8239;and saw some of his disciples eating their bread with unwashed hands.
    <sup>3</sup>&#8239;(For the Pharisees, and all the Jews, only eat if they have carefully wash&shy;ed their hands, keeping the tradition of the elders.
    <sup>4</sup>&#8239;When they come from the marketplace, they only eat after they have washed.  They keep many other traditions such as the washing of cups, pitchers, copper pots, and dining couches.)
</p>

<p>
    <sup>7:5</sup>&#8239;The Pharisees and the scribes asked him, <q>Why don&#x02BC;t your disciples keep the tradition of the elders? Instead, they eat with unwashed hands.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>7:6</sup>&#8239;He replied, <q>Isaiah prophesied correctly about you hypocrites, as it is written: <q>This people honors me with their lips, but their heart is far from me.
    <sup>7</sup>&#8239;They worship me in vain, teaching as doctrines the commandments of men.</q>
    <sup>8</sup>&#8239;Neglecting the commandment of God, you hold on to the tradition of men.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>7:9</sup>&#8239;He said to them, <q>You have a fine way of rejecting the commandment of God in order to keep your tradition.
    <sup>10</sup>&#8239;For Moses said, <q>Honor your father and your mother,</q> and <q>Whoever speaks evil of father or mother, must be put to death.</q>
    <sup>11</sup>&#8239;But you say, if a man says to his father or his mother, <q>Whatever you would have received from me is devoted to God,</q>
    <sup>12</sup>&#8239;you no longer let him do anything for his father or his mother.
    <sup>13</sup>&#8239;The tradition that you have handed down nullifies the word of God. You do many things like that.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>7:14</sup>&#8239;He summoned the crowd again, and said to them, <q>Everyone listen to me and understand:
    <sup>15</sup>&#8239;Noth&shy;ing that enters a person from outside can defile him, but the things that come out of a person are what defile him.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>7:17</sup>&#8239;When he entered the house away from the crowd, his disciples asked him about the parable.
    <sup>18</sup>&#8239;He said to them, <q>Are you also without understanding?  Do you not see that whatever goes into a person from outside cannot defile him,
    <sup>19</sup>&#8239;because it doesn&#x02BC;t go into his heart, but into his stomach and is eliminated?</q> (thus he declared all foods clean).
</p>

<p>
    <sup>7:20</sup>&#8239;He said, <q>What comes out of a person is what defiles him.
    <sup>21</sup>&#8239;For from within, out of a person&#x02BC;s heart, come evil thoughts, sexual immorality, theft, murder, adultery,
    <sup>22</sup>&#8239;coveting, wickedness, deceit, sensuality, envy, slander, pride, foolishness.
    <sup>23</sup>&#8239;All these evil things proceed from within, and defile a person.</q>
</p>


<hr class="scene" />

<p>
    <sup>8:11</sup>&#8239;The Pharisees came and began to argue with him, demanding of him a sign from heaven to test him.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>8:12</sup>&#8239;He sighed deeply in his spirit, and said, <q>Why does this generation demand a sign? Truly, I tell you, no sign will be given to this generation.</q>
    <sup>13</sup>&#8239;He left them, got back into the boat, and went to the other side.
</p>


<hr class="scene" />

<p>
    <sup>8:27</sup>&#8239;Jesus and his disciples went to the villages of Caesarea Philippi. On the way he asked his disciples, <q>Who do people say that I am?</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>8:28</sup>&#8239;They told him, <q>John the Baptist; others say Elijah; but others, one of the prophets.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>8:29</sup>&#8239;He asked them, <q>But who do you say that I am?</q> Peter answered <q>You are the Christ.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>8:30</sup>&#8239;He warned them to tell no one about him.
</p>


<hr class="scene" />

<p>
    <sup>8:31</sup>&#8239;He began to teach them that the son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected by the elders, chief priests, and scribes, and be killed, and after three days rise again.
    <sup>32</sup>&#8239;He spoke openly about this. Peter took him aside, and began to rebuke him.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>8:33</sup>&#8239;Turning and seeing his disciples, he rebuked Peter, and said, <q>Get behind me, Tempter. For you&#x02BC;re not thinking about the things of God, but the things of man.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>8:34</sup>&#8239;He summoned the crowd with his disciples, and said to them, <q>If anyone wants to come after me, let him deny himself, take up his cross, and follow me.
    <sup>35</sup>&#8239;For whoever wants to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for my sake and the gospel&#x02BC;s will save it.
    <sup>36</sup>&#8239;What does it profit a man to gain the whole world, and forfeit his soul?
    <sup>37</sup>&#8239;What can a man give in exchange for his soul?
    <sup>38</sup>&#8239;Who&shy;ev&shy;er is ashamed of me and my words in this adulterous and sinful generation, the son of man will also be ashamed of him when he comes in his father&#x02BC;s glory with the holy angels.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>9:1</sup>&#8239;He said to them, <q>Truly, I tell you, there are some standing here who will not taste death until they see God&#x02BC;s kingdom come with power.</q>
</p>


<hr class="scene" />

<p>
    <sup>9:2</sup>&#8239;After six days Jesus took Peter, Ja&shy;mes, and John with him, and led them up a high mountain by themselves. He was transfigured in front of them,
    <sup>3</sup>&#8239;and his clothes became radiant, intensely white, as no one on earth could whiten them.
    <sup>4</sup>&#8239;Elijah and Moses appeared to them, and they were talking with Jesus.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>9:7</sup>&#8239;A cloud overshadowed them, and a voice from the cloud said, <q>This is my beloved son. Listen to him.</q>
    <sup>8</sup>&#8239;Suddenly, looking around, they no longer saw anyone with them except Jesus.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>9:9</sup>&#8239;As they were coming down the mountain, he ordered them to tell no one what they had seen, until the son of man had risen from the dead.
    <sup>10</sup>&#8239;They kept it to themselves, discussing what it meant to rise from the dead.
</p>


<hr class="scene" />

<p>
    <sup>9:14</sup>&#8239;When they came to the disciples, they saw a large crowd around them, and scribes arguing with them.
    <sup>15</sup>&#8239;As soon as the crowd saw him, they were amazed, and ran to greet him.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>9:16</sup>&#8239;He asked them, <q>What are you arguing with them about?</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>9:17</sup>&#8239;Someone in the crowd answered him, <q>Teacher, I brought my son to you. He has a spirit that makes him mute.
    <sup>18</sup>&#8239;Whenever it seizes him, it throws him down. He foams at the mouth, grinds his teeth, and becomes rigid. I asked your disciples to cast it out, but they couldn&#x02BC;t.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>9:19</sup>&#8239;He answered them, <q>You unbelieving generation, how long will I be with you? How long will I put up with you? Bring him to me.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>9:20</sup>&#8239;They brought the boy to him. Wh&shy;en the spirit saw him, it immediately threw the boy into a convulsion. He fell to the ground, and rolled around, foaming at the mouth.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>9:21</sup>&#8239;Jesus asked his father, <q>How long has this been happening to him?</q> And he said, <q>From childhood.
    <sup>22</sup>&#8239;It has often thrown him into fire or water to destroy him. If you can do anything, have compassion on us, and help us.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>9:23</sup>&#8239;Jesus said to him, <q><q>If you can?</q> Everything is possible for one who believes.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>9:24</sup>&#8239;Im&shy;me&shy;di&shy;ate&shy;ly the boy&#x02BC;s father cried out, <q>I do believe. Help my unbelief.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>9:25</sup>&#8239;When Jesus saw that a crowd was rapidly gathering, he rebuked the unclean spirit, saying to it, <q>You mute and deaf spirit, I command you: come out of him and never enter him again.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>9:26</sup>&#8239;After crying out, and throwing him into terrible convulsions, it came out. The boy was like a corpse, so that most of them said, <q>He&#x02BC;s dead.</q>
    <sup>27</sup>&#8239;But Jesus took him by the hand, and lifted him up, and he got up.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>9:28</sup>&#8239;After he entered the house, his disciples asked him privately, <q>Why couldn&#x02BC;t we cast it out?</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>9:29</sup>&#8239;He said to them, <q>This kind only comes out by prayer.</q>
</p>


<hr class="scene" />

<p>
    <sup>9:30</sup>&#8239;They left that place, and passed through Galilee.  He did not want anyone to know,
    <sup>31</sup>&#8239;because he was teaching his disciples, saying to them, <q>The son of man will be delivered into the hands of men, and they will kill him. After he&#x02BC;s killed, he&#x02BC;ll rise three days later.</q>
    <sup>32</sup>&#8239;But they did not understand this statement, and were afraid to ask him.
</p>


<hr class="scene" />

<p>
    <sup>9:33</sup>&#8239;They came to Capernaum. When he was in the house, he asked them, <q>What were you discussing on the way?</q>
    <sup>34</sup>&#8239;But they were silent, because on the way they had been arguing about which of them was the greatest.
    <sup>35</sup>&#8239;He sat down, called the twelve, and said to them, <q>If anyone wants to be first, he must be last of all, and servant of all.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>9:36</sup>&#8239;He took a child, and had him stand among them. Taking him in his arms, he said to them,
    <sup>37</sup>&#8239;<q>Whoever welcomes one child like this in my name welcomes me. Whoever welcomes me, doesn&#x02BC;t welcome me, but him that sent me.</q>
</p>


<hr class="scene" />

<p>
    <sup>9:38</sup>&#8239;John said to him, <q>Teacher, we saw someone casting out demons in your name, and we tried to stop him, because he didn&#x02BC;t follow us.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>9:39</sup>&#8239;But Jesus said, <q>Don&#x02BC;t stop him. No one can do a miracle in my name, then soon afterward speak evil of me.
    <sup>40</sup>&#8239;Who&shy;ev&shy;er is not against us is for us.
    <sup>41</sup>&#8239;Truly I tell you, whoever gives you a cup of water to drink, because you are Christ&#x02BC;s, will never lose his reward.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>9:42</sup>&#8239;<q>Who&shy;ev&shy;er causes one of these little ones who believe in me to stumble, it would be better for him if a heavy millstone were hung around his neck, and he were thrown into the sea.
    <sup>43</sup>&#8239;If your hand causes you to stumble, cut it off. It&#x02BC;s better for you to enter life crippled than to go to hell, into the unquenchable fire, with two hands.
    <sup>45</sup>&#8239;If your foot causes you to stumble, cut it off. It&#x02BC;s better for you to enter life lame than to be thrown into hell with two feet.
    <sup>47</sup>&#8239;If your eye causes you to stumble, tear it out. It&#x02BC;s better for you to enter God&#x02BC;s kingdom with one eye than to be thrown into hell with two eyes;
    <sup>48</sup>&#8239;<q>where their worm does not die, and the fire is not quenched.</q></q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>9:49</sup>&#8239;<q>For everyone will be salted with fire.
    <sup>50</sup>&#8239;Salt is good, but if the salt becomes unsalty, how will you make it salty again? Have salt in yourselves, and be at peace with one another.</q>
</p>


<hr class="scene" />

<p>
    <sup>10:1</sup>&#8239;He left there and went into the region of Judea and beyond the Jordan. Crowds gathered around him again. Again he taught them, as was his custom.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>10:2</sup>&#8239;Pharisees came to him. Testing him, they asked, <q>Is it lawful for a man to divorce a wife?</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>10:3</sup>&#8239;He answered them, <q>What did Moses command you?</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>10:4</sup>&#8239;They said, <q>Moses allowed a man to <q>write a certificate of divorce, and send her away.</q></q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>10:5</sup>&#8239;But Jesus said to them, <q>He wrote you this commandment because of your hard hearts.
    <sup>6</sup>&#8239;But from the beginning of creation, <q>God made them male and female.</q>
    <sup>7</sup>&#8239;<q>Therefore a man will leave his father and mother,
    <sup>8</sup>&#8239;and the two will become one flesh.</q> So they are no longer two, but one flesh.
    <sup>9</sup>&#8239;Therefore what God has joined together, let no one separate.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>10:10</sup>&#8239;In the house the disciples asked him about this again.
    <sup>11</sup>&#8239;He said to them, <q>Whoever divorces his wife, and marries another, commits adultery against her.
    <sup>12</sup>&#8239;And if she divorces her husband, and marries another, she commits adultery.</q>
</p>


<hr class="scene" />

<p>
    <sup>10:13</sup>&#8239;People were bringing children to him, so that he might touch them, but the disciples rebuked them.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>10:14</sup>&#8239;When Jesus saw it, he was indignant, and said to them, <q>Let the children come to me. Don&#x02BC;t hinder them, for God&#x02BC;s kingdom belongs to such as these.
    <sup>15</sup>&#8239;Truly I tell you, whoever does not receive God&#x02BC;s kingdom like a child, will never enter it.</q>
    <sup>16</sup>&#8239;He took them in his arms, laid his hands on them, and blessed them.
</p>


<hr class="scene" />

<p>
    <sup>10:17</sup>&#8239;As he was setting out on his journey, a man ran up to him, knelt in front of him, and asked him, <q>Good teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>10:18</sup>&#8239;Jesus said to him, <q>Why do you call me good? No one is good except God alone.
    <sup>19</sup>&#8239;You know the commandments: <q>Do not murder, Do not commit adultery, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Do not defraud, Honor your father and mother.</q></q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>10:20</sup>&#8239;He said to him, <q>Teacher, I&#x02BC;ve kept all these from my youth.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>10:21</sup>&#8239;Looking at him, Jesus loved him, and said to him, <q>You lack one thing: go, sell all you have, give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow me.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>10:22</sup>&#8239;But he was saddened by these wo&shy;rds, and he went away grieving, for he had many possessions.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>10:23</sup>&#8239;Jesus looked around, and said to his disciples, <q>How hard it will be for those who have wealth to enter God&#x02BC;s kingdom.</q>
    <sup>24</sup>&#8239;The disciples were amazed at his words. But Jesus said to them again, <q>Children, how hard it is to enter God&#x02BC;s kingdom.
    <sup>25</sup>&#8239;It&#x02BC;s easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter God&#x02BC;s kingdom.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>10:26</sup>&#8239;They were even more astonished, and asked him, <q>Then who can be saved?</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>10:27</sup>&#8239;Looking at them, Jesus said, <q>Wi&shy;th man it&#x02BC;s impossible, but not with God. Because all things are possible with God.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>10:28</sup>&#8239;Peter began to tell him, <q>See, we&#x02BC;ve left everything, and followed you.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>10:29</sup>&#8239;Jesus said, <q>Truly I tell you, there is no one who has left house or brothers or sisters or mother or father or children or fields, for my sake, and for the gospel,
    <sup>30</sup>&#8239;who will not receive a hundredfold now in this time, houses and brothers and sisters and mothers and children and fields, with persecutions, and eternal life in the age to come.
    <sup>31</sup>&#8239;But many who are first will be last, and the last first.</q>
</p>


<hr class="scene" />

<p>
    <sup>10:32</sup>&#8239;They were on the road, going up to Jerusalem, and Jesus was walking ahead of them. They were amazed, and those who followed were afraid. He took the twelve again, and began to tell them what was going to happen to him,
    <sup>33</sup>&#8239;<q>We&#x02BC;re going up to Jerusalem, and the son of man will be delivered to the chief priests and the scribes. They&#x02BC;ll condemn him to death, and deliver him to the Gentiles.
    <sup>34</sup>&#8239;They&#x02BC;ll mock him, spit on him, scourge him, and kill him.  He&#x02BC;ll rise after three days.</q>
</p>


<hr class="scene" />

<p>
    <sup>10:42</sup>&#8239;Jesus called them over, and said to them, <q>You know that those who are considered rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and their great ones exercise authority over them.
    <sup>43</sup>&#8239;But it is not this way among you. Instead, whoever wants to become great among you must be your servant,
    <sup>44</sup>&#8239;and whoever wants to be first among you must be slave of all.
    <sup>45</sup>&#8239;For even the son of man didn&#x02BC;t come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many.</q>
</p>


<hr class="scene" />

<p>
    <sup>10:46</sup>&#8239;They came to Jericho. As he was leaving Jericho with his disciples and a large crowd, a blind beggar named Bartimaeus, the son of Timaeus, was sitting by the road.
    <sup>47</sup>&#8239;When he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth, he began to cry out, <q>Jesus, son of David, have mercy on me.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>10:48</sup>&#8239;Many sternly told him to be silent, but he cried out even louder, <q>Son of David, have mercy on me.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>10:49</sup>&#8239;Jesus stopped and said, <q>Call him.</q> And they called the blind man, saying to him, <q>Take courage. Get up. He&#x02BC;s calling for you.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>10:50</sup>&#8239;Throwing aside his cloak, he jump&shy;ed up, and came to Jesus.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>10:51</sup>&#8239;Jesus asked him, <q>What do you want me to do for you?</q> The blind man said to him, <q>Rabbi, I want to regain my sight.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>10:52</sup>&#8239;Jesus said to him, <q>Go, your faith has made you well.</q> Immediately he regained his sight, and began following him on the road.
</p>


<hr class="scene" />

<p>
    <sup>11:1</sup>&#8239;As they approached Jerusalem, at Bethphage and Bethany, near the Mount of Olives, he sent two of his disciples,
    <sup>2</sup>&#8239;and told them, <q>Go into the village ahead of you. As soon as you enter it, you&#x02BC;ll find a colt tied, on which no one has ever sat. Untie it, and bring it.
    <sup>3</sup>&#8239;If anyone asks you, <q>Why are you doing this?</q> say, <q>The Lord needs it and will send it back immediately.</q></q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>11:4</sup>&#8239;They went, found a colt outside in the street tied by a door, and untied it.
    <sup>5</sup>&#8239;Some of the bystanders asked them, <q>Why are you untying the colt?</q>
    <sup>6</sup>&#8239;They told them what Jesus had said, and they gave them permission.
    <sup>7</sup>&#8239;They brought the colt to Jesus, and put their coats on it. He sat on it.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>11:8</sup>&#8239;Many people spread their coats on the road, and others spread leafy branches cut from the fields.
    <sup>9</sup>&#8239;Those who went in front, and those who followed shouted, <q>Hosanna. Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.
    <sup>10</sup>&#8239;Blessed is the coming kingdom of our father David. Hosanna in the highest.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>11:11</sup>&#8239;Jesus went into Jerusalem, and into the temple. After looking around at everything, he left for Bethany with the twelve, since it was already late.
</p>


<hr class="scene" />

<p>
    <sup>11:15</sup>&#8239;They came to Jerusalem. He entered the temple, and began to drive out those buying and selling in the temple, and overturned the tables of the money changers and the seats of those selling doves.
    <sup>16</sup>&#8239;He would not allow anyone to carry merchandise through the temple.
    <sup>17</sup>&#8239;He taught, and said to them, <q>Isn&#x02BC;t it written, <q>My house will be called a house of prayer for all the nations</q>? But you have made it <q>a den of robbers.</q></q>
</p>


<hr class="scene" />

<p>
    <sup>11:27</sup>&#8239;They came again to Jerusalem. As he was walking in the temple, the chief priests, the scribes, and the elders came to him.
    <sup>28</sup>&#8239;They asked him, <q>By what authority are you doing these things, or who gave you this authority to do these things?</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>11:29</sup>&#8239;Jesus said to them, <q>I will ask you one question. Answer me, and I will tell you by what authority I do these things.
    <sup>30</sup>&#8239;Was John&#x02BC;s baptism from heaven or from men? Answer me.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>11:31</sup>&#8239;They discussed it with one another, saying, <q>If we say, <q>From heaven,</q> he will say, <q>Then why didn&#x02BC;t you believe him?</q>
    <sup>32</sup>&#8239;But should we say, <q>From men</q>?</q> They feared the people, for everyone thought that John really was a prophet.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>11:33</sup>&#8239;They answered Jesus, <q>We don&#x02BC;t know.</q> Jesus said to them, <q>Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things.</q>
</p>


<hr class="scene" />

<p>
    <sup>12:1</sup>&#8239;He began to speak to them in parables. <q>A man planted a vineyard, put a fence around it, dug a pit for a winepress, and built a tower. Then he leased it to tenants, and went on a journey.
    <sup>2</sup>&#8239;At harvest time, he sent a servant to the tenants to collect some of the fruit of the vineyard from them.
    <sup>3</sup>&#8239;They took him, beat him, and sent him away empty-handed.
    <sup>4</sup>&#8239;Again he sent them another servant. They hit him on the head, and treated him shamefully.
    <sup>5</sup>&#8239;He sent another, and they killed that one. He sent many others; they beat some, and killed others.
    <sup>6</sup>&#8239;He had one more to send, a beloved son. Finally he sent him to them, saying, <q>They will respect my son.</q></q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>12:7</sup>&#8239;<q>But those tenants said to one another, <q>This is the heir. Come, let&#x02BC;s kill him, and the inheritance will be ours.</q>
    <sup>8</sup>&#8239;They took him, killed him, and threw him out of the vineyard.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>12:9</sup>&#8239;<q>What will the vineyard&#x02BC;s owner do? He will come and destroy the tenants, and give the vineyard to others.
    <sup>10</sup>&#8239;Haven&#x02BC;t you read this scripture: <q>The stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone.
    <sup>11</sup>&#8239;This was the Lord&#x02BC;s doing, and it is marvelous in our eyes</q>?</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>12:12</sup>&#8239;They were seeking to arrest him, because they understood that he spoke the parable against them, but they feared the crowd. So they left him, and went away.
</p>


<hr class="scene" />

<p>
    <sup>12:13</sup>&#8239;They sent some of the Pharisees and Herodians to him, so that they might trap him in his words.
    <sup>14</sup>&#8239;When they came, they said to him, <q>Teacher, we know that you&#x02BC;re truthful. You don&#x02BC;t care what anyone thinks, because you&#x02BC;re impartial. You truthfully teach the way of God. Is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar, or not? Should we pay them or shouldn&#x02BC;t we?</q>
    <sup>15</sup>&#8239;But, knowing their hypocrisy, he said to them, <q>Why are you testing me? Bring me a denarius to look at.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>12:16</sup>&#8239;They brought one. He asked them, <q>Whose image and inscription is this?</q> They answered, <q>Caesar&#x02BC;s.</q>
    <sup>17</sup>&#8239;Jesus said to them, <q>Give to Caesar the things that are Caesar&#x02BC;s, and to God the things that are God&#x02BC;s.</q> And they marveled at him.
</p>


<hr class="scene" />

<p>
    <sup>12:18</sup>&#8239;Some Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection, came to Jesus and asked him,
    <sup>19</sup>&#8239;<q>Teacher, Moses wrote for us that if a man&#x02BC;s brother dies, and leaves behind a wife but no child, that his brother must marry the widow, and raise up children for his brother.
    <sup>20</sup>&#8239;There were seven brothers. The first one took a wife, and died without children.
    <sup>21</sup>&#8239;The second one married her, and died without children. The third one likewise.
    <sup>22</sup>&#8239;None of the seven left children. Last of all, the woman died too.
    <sup>23</sup>&#8239;In the resurrection, when they rise, whose wife will she be? For all seven had married her.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>12:24</sup>&#8239;Jesus said to them, <q>Isn&#x02BC;t this the reason you are mistaken: you don&#x02BC;t know the scriptures or the power of God?
    <sup>25</sup>&#8239;For when the dead rise, they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are like angels in heaven.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>12:26</sup>&#8239;<q>As for the dead being raised, have&shy;n&#x02BC;t you read in the book of Moses, in the passage about the burning bush, how God said to him, <q>I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob</q>?
    <sup>27</sup>&#8239;He isn&#x02BC;t God of the dead, but of the living. You&#x02BC;re greatly mistaken.</q>
</p>


<hr class="scene" />

<p>
    <sup>12:28</sup>&#8239;One of the scribes came, and heard them arguing. Seeing that he answered them well, he asked him, <q>Which commandment is the most important of all?</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>12:29</sup>&#8239;Jesus answered, <q>The most important is, <q>Hear, O Israel. The Lord our God is one Lord.
    <sup>30</sup>&#8239;Love the Lord your God with all your heart, soul, mind, and strength.</q>
    <sup>31</sup>&#8239;The second is this, <q>Love your neighbor as yourself.</q> There is no commandment greater than these.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>12:32</sup>&#8239;The scribe said to him, <q>You are right teacher. You stated correctly that he is one, and there is no one else but him.
    <sup>33</sup>&#8239;To love him with all the heart, understanding, and strength, and to love one&#x02BC;s neighbor as himself, is more important than all burnt offerings and sacrifices.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>12:34</sup>&#8239;When Jesus saw that he answered wisely, he said to him, <q>You aren&#x02BC;t far from God&#x02BC;s kingdom.</q> After that, no one dared to ask him any more questions.
</p>


<hr class="scene" />

<p>
    <sup>12:38</sup>&#8239;In his teaching he said, <q>Beware of the scribes, who like walking around in long robes, being greeted in the marketplaces,
    <sup>39</sup>&#8239;the best seats in the synagogues, and places of honor at banquets.
    <sup>40</sup>&#8239;They devour widows&#x02BC; houses, and offer long prayers for show. They will receive greater condemnation.</q>
</p>


<hr class="scene" />

<p>
    <sup>13:1</sup>&#8239;As he came out of the temple, one of his disciples said to him, <q>Teacher, look at these wonderful stones and buildings!</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>13:2</sup>&#8239;Jesus said to him, <q>Do you see these great buildings? Not one stone will be left upon another; all will be thrown down.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>13:3</sup>&#8239;As he sat on the Mount of Olives opposite the temple, Peter, James, John and Andrew asked him privately,
    <sup>4</sup>&#8239;<q>Tell us, when will these things happen? What will be the sign that they are about to be fulfilled?</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>13:5</sup>&#8239;Jesus began to say to them, <q>See that no one leads you astray.
    <sup>6</sup>&#8239;Many will come in my name, saying, <q>I am he,</q> and will mislead many.
    <sup>12</sup>&#8239;Brother will betray brother to death, and a father his child. Children will rise against parents, and have them put to death.
    <sup>13</sup>&#8239;Everyone will hate you because of my name, but he who endures to the end will be saved.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>13:31</sup>&#8239;<q>Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words won&#x02BC;t pass away.
    <sup>32</sup>&#8239;No one knows about that day or that hour, not even the angels in heaven, nor the son, but only the father.
    <sup>33</sup>&#8239;Be on guard. Be alert. For you don&#x02BC;t know when the time will come.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>13:34</sup>&#8239;<q>It&#x02BC;s like a man on a journey: when he leaves home, he puts his servants in charge, each with a task, and commands the doorkeeper to be alert.
    <sup>35</sup>&#8239;Therefore be alert. You don&#x02BC;t know when the master of the house will come. It could be in the evening, at midnight, when the rooster crows, or in the morning.
    <sup>36</sup>&#8239;Otherwise, he may come suddenly and find you asleep.
    <sup>37</sup>&#8239;What I say to you, I say to everyone: Be alert.</q>
</p>


<hr class="scene" />

<p>
    <sup>14:1</sup>&#8239;The Passover and the Feast of Unleavened Bread were now two days away. The chief priests and the scribes sought a way to arrest him by stealth, and kill him.
    <sup>2</sup>&#8239;But they said, <q>Not during the feast, otherwise the people might riot.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>14:3</sup>&#8239;While he was in Bethany in the house of Simon the leper, and reclining at the table, a woman came with an alabaster jar of very expensive perfume of pure nard. She broke the jar, and poured it over his head.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>14:4</sup>&#8239;Some expressed indignation to one another, saying, <q>Why has this perfume been wasted?
    <sup>5</sup>&#8239;This perfume might have been sold for more than three hundred denarii, and the money given to the poor.</q> And they scolded her.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>14:6</sup>&#8239;Jesus said, <q>Leave her alone. Why are you bothering her? She&#x02BC;s done a beautiful thing for me.
    <sup>7</sup>&#8239;You always have the poor with you. Whenever you want, you can do good for them, but you won&#x02BC;t always have me.
    <sup>8</sup>&#8239;She has done what she could. She has anointed my body beforehand for the burial.
    <sup>9</sup>&#8239;Truly I tell you, wherever the gospel is preached in the whole world, what she has done will be told in memory of her.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>14:10</sup>&#8239;Then Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve, went to the chief priests to betray him to them.
    <sup>11</sup>&#8239;They were glad when they heard this, and promised to give him money. He began looking for an opportunity to betray him.
</p>


<hr class="scene" />

<p>
    <sup>14:12</sup>&#8239;On the first day of Unleavened Bread, when the Passover lamb was being sacrificed, his disciples asked him, <q>Where do you want us to go to prepare for you to eat the Passover?</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>14:13</sup>&#8239;He sent two of his disciples, and told them, <q>Go into the city. A man carrying a pitcher of water will meet you. Follow him.
    <sup>14</sup>&#8239;Wherever he enters, say to the owner of the house, <q>The teacher says, Where is my guest room, where I may eat the passover with my disciples?</q>
    <sup>15</sup>&#8239;He will show you a large upper room furnished and ready. Prepare for us there.</q>
    <sup>16</sup>&#8239;The disciples went out, entered the city, and found it just as he had told them.  They prepared the Passover.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>14:17</sup>&#8239;When it was evening, he arrived with the twelve.
    <sup>18</sup>&#8239;While they were reclining at table and eating, Jesus said, <q>Truly I tell you, one of you will betray me, one who is eating with me.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>14:19</sup>&#8239;They began to be grieved, and to say to him one by one, <q>Surely not I?</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>14:20</sup>&#8239;He said to them, <q>It&#x02BC;s one of the twelve, one who is dipping bread into the bowl with me.
    <sup>21</sup>&#8239;For the son of man goes as it is written of him, but woe to that man by whom the son of man is betrayed!  It would have been better for that man if he had not been born.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>14:22</sup>&#8239;As they were eating, he took bread, blessed it, broke it, gave it to them, and said, <q>Take it. This is my body.</q>
    <sup>23</sup>&#8239;He took a cup, and after giving thanks, he gave it to them, and they all drank from it.
    <sup>24</sup>&#8239;He said to them, <q>This is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many.
    <sup>25</sup>&#8239;Truly I tell you, I won&#x02BC;t drink of the fruit of the vine again until that day when I drink it new in God&#x02BC;s kingdom.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>14:26</sup>&#8239;After singing a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives.
</p>


<hr class="scene" />

<p>
    <sup>14:27</sup>&#8239;Jesus said to them, <q>You will all fall away, because it is written, <q>I will strike down the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered.</q>
    <sup>28</sup>&#8239;But after I&#x02BC;m raised up, I&#x02BC;ll go ahead of you to Galilee.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>14:29</sup>&#8239;Peter said to him, <q>Even if everyone falls away, I won&#x02BC;t.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>14:30</sup>&#8239;Jesus said to him, <q>Truly I tell you, that this very night, before a rooster crows twice, you will deny me three times.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>14:31</sup>&#8239;But he kept insisting, <q>If I have to die with you, I won&#x02BC;t deny you.</q>  They all said the same thing.
</p>


<hr class="scene" />

<p>
    <sup>14:32</sup>&#8239;They went to a place called Gethsemane. He told his disciples, <q>Sit here while I pray.</q>
    <sup>33</sup>&#8239;He took Peter, James and John with him, and began to be very distressed and troubled.
    <sup>34</sup>&#8239;He told them, <q>My soul is deeply grieved to the point of death. Stay here, and keep watch.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>14:35</sup>&#8239;He went a little farther, fell to the ground, and prayed that, if it were possible, the hour might pass from him.
    <sup>36</sup>&#8239;He said, <q>Father, everything is possible for you.  Remove this cup from me. Yet not what I will, but what you will.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>14:37</sup>&#8239;He came, found them sleeping, and said to Peter, <q>Simon, are you asleep? Couldn&#x02BC;t you keep watch for one hour?
    <sup>38</sup>&#8239;Keep watch and pray, that you won&#x02BC;t come into temptation. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>14:39</sup>&#8239;Again he went away, and prayed, saying the same words.
    <sup>40</sup>&#8239;Again he came, and found them sleeping, because their eyes were very heavy. They didn&#x02BC;t know what to say to him.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>14:41</sup>&#8239;He came the third time, and said to them, <q>Are you still sleeping and resting? It&#x02BC;s enough. The time has come. See, the son of man is being betrayed into the hands of sinners.
    <sup>42</sup>&#8239;Get up. Let&#x02BC;s go. See, my betrayer is near.</q>
</p>


<hr class="scene" />

<p>
    <sup>14:43</sup>&#8239;While he was still speaking, Judas, one of the twelve, arrived. With him was a crowd, armed with swords and clubs, who was sent from the chief priests, the scribes and the elders.
    <sup>44</sup>&#8239;The betrayer had given them a sign, saying, <q>The one I kiss is the one. Arrest him, and lead him away under guard.</q>
    <sup>45</sup>&#8239;Going directly to Jesus, he said, <q>Rabbi!</q> and kissed him.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>14:46</sup>&#8239;They laid hands on him, and arrested him.
    <sup>47</sup>&#8239;One of the bystanders drew his sword, and struck the high priest&#x02BC;s servant, cutting off his ear.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>14:48</sup>&#8239;Jesus said to them, <q>Have you come out with swords and clubs to arrest me, as you would arrest a robber?
    <sup>49</sup>&#8239;I was with you every day, teaching in the temple, and you didn&#x02BC;t arrest me, but this has happened to fulfill the scriptures.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>14:50</sup>&#8239;They all left him, and fled.
    <sup>51</sup>&#8239;A young man was following him, wearing only a linen cloth around his naked body. They seized him,
    <sup>52</sup>&#8239;but he left the linen cloth, and fled naked.
</p>


<hr class="scene" />

<p>
    <sup>14:53</sup>&#8239;They led Jesus to the high priest. All the chief priests, the elders and the scribes assembled.
    <sup>54</sup>&#8239;Peter followed him at a distance, right into the high priest&#x02BC;s courtyard. He was sitting with the guards, and warming himself by the fire.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>14:55</sup>&#8239;The chief priests and the whole council sought testimony against Jesus to put him to death, but found none.
    <sup>56</sup>&#8239;Many gave false testimony against him, but their testimony was inconsistent.
    <sup>57</sup>&#8239;So&shy;me stood up, and gave false testimony against him, saying,
    <sup>58</sup>&#8239;<q>We heard him say, <q>I&#x02BC;ll destroy this temple made with hands, and in three days I&#x02BC;ll build another made without hands.</q></q>
    <sup>59</sup>&#8239;But even this testimony was inconsistent.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>14:60</sup>&#8239;The high priest stood up in front of them, and asked Jesus, <q>Don&#x02BC;t you answer? What is it that these men testify against you?</q>
    <sup>61</sup>&#8239;But he kept silent, and did not answer. Again the high priest asked him, <q>Are you the Christ, the son of the Blessed One?</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>14:62</sup>&#8239;Jesus said, <q>I am. You&#x02BC;ll see the son of man sitting at the right hand of power, and coming with the clouds of heaven.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>14:63</sup>&#8239;The high priest tore his clothes, and said, <q>Why do we need any more witnesses?
    <sup>64</sup>&#8239;You&#x02BC;ve heard the blasphemy. What&#x02BC;s your decision?</q> They all condemned him as deserving death.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>14:65</sup>&#8239;Some began to spit on him, and to cover his face and strike him, saying, <q>Prophesy.</q> The guards received him with slaps in the face.
</p>


<hr class="scene" />

<p>
    <sup>14:66</sup>&#8239;While Peter was in the courtyard below, one of the high priest&#x02BC;s servant girls came.
    <sup>67</sup>&#8239;Seeing Peter warming himself, she looked at him, and said, <q>You also were with Jesus the Nazarene.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>14:68</sup>&#8239;But he denied it, saying, <q>I don&#x02BC;t know or understand what you&#x02BC;re talking about.</q> He went out to the entryway, and a rooster crowed.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>14:69</sup>&#8239;The servant girl saw him, and began again to tell the bystanders, <q>This man is one of them.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>14:70</sup>&#8239;But again he denied it. After a little while the bystanders again said to Peter, <q>You&#x02BC;re certainly one of them, since you&#x02BC;re a Galilean too.</q>
    <sup>71</sup>&#8239;But he began to curse and swear, <q>I don&#x02BC;t know this man you&#x02BC;re talking about.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>14:72</sup>&#8239;Im&shy;me&shy;di&shy;ate&shy;ly a rooster crowed a second time. Peter remembered when Jesus said to him, <q>Before a rooster crows twice, you&#x02BC;ll deny me three times</q>. He began to weep.
</p>


<hr class="scene" />

<p>
    <sup>15:1</sup>&#8239;Early in the morning, the chief priests, elders, scribes, and the whole council held a consultation. They bound Jesus, led him away, and delivered him to Pilate.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>15:2</sup>&#8239;Pilate asked him, <q>Are you the king of the Jews?</q> He answered, <q>You have said so.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>15:3</sup>&#8239;The chief priests accused him of many things.
    <sup>4</sup>&#8239;Pilate again asked him, <q>Don&#x02BC;t you answer? Look how many char&shy;ges they bring against you.</q>
    <sup>5</sup>&#8239;But Jesus answered no further, so Pilate was amazed.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>15:6</sup>&#8239;Now at the feast he used to release for them any one prisoner whom they requested.
    <sup>7</sup>&#8239;The man named Barabbas was in prison with rebels who had committed murder during the insurrection.
    <sup>8</sup>&#8239;The crowd came up and began to ask Pilate to do for them as he usually did.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>15:9</sup>&#8239;Pilate answered them, saying, <q>Do you want me to release the king of the Jews for you?</q>
    <sup>10</sup>&#8239;For he knew that the chief priests had handed him over because of envy.
    <sup>11</sup>&#8239;But the chief priests stirred up the crowd to have him release Barabbas for them instead.
    <sup>12</sup>&#8239;Pilate again asked them, <q>Then what should I do with the one you call the king of the Jews?</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>15:13</sup>&#8239;They shouted back, <q>Crucify him!</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>15:14</sup>&#8239;Pilate asked them, <q>Why? What evil has he done?</q> But they shouted all the more, <q>Crucify him!</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>15:15</sup>&#8239;Wishing to satisfy the crowd, Pilate released Barabbas for them. After having Jesus flogged, he handed him over to be crucified.
</p>


<hr class="scene" />

<p>
    <sup>15:21</sup>&#8239;Simon of Cyrene, the father of Alexander and Rufus, was passing by, coming from the country. They forced him to carry Jesus&#x02BC;s cross.
    <sup>22</sup>&#8239;They brought Jesus to the place called Golgotha, which means place of a skull.
    <sup>23</sup>&#8239;They offered him wine mixed with myrrh, but he did not take it.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>15:24</sup>&#8239;They crucified him, and divided his clothes among themselves, casting lots to decide what each should take.
    <sup>25</sup>&#8239;It was nine in the morning when they crucified him.
    <sup>26</sup>&#8239;The inscription of the charge against him read, <q>The King of the Jews</q>.
    <sup>27</sup>&#8239;They crucified two robbers with him, one on his right and one on his left.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>15:29</sup>&#8239;Those who passed by derided him, shaking their heads, and saying, <q>Ha! You who would destroy the temple and rebuild it in three days,
    <sup>30</sup>&#8239;save yourself, and come down from the cross.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>15:31</sup>&#8239;In the same way, the chief priests and the scribes mocked him to one another saying, <q>He saved others. He can&#x02BC;t save himself.
    <sup>32</sup>&#8239;Let this Christ, the King of Israel, come down now from the cross, so that we may see and believe.</q> Those who were crucified with him also insulted him.
</p>


<hr class="scene" />

<p>
    <sup>15:33</sup>&#8239;At noon, darkness fell over the whole land until three in the afternoon.
    <sup>34</sup>&#8239;At three in the afternoon Jesus cried with a loud voice, <q>My God, my God, why have you abandoned me?</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>15:37</sup>&#8239;Jesus let out a loud cry, and br&shy;ea&shy;thed his last.
    <sup>38</sup>&#8239;The curtain of the temple was torn in two, from the top to the bottom.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>15:39</sup>&#8239;When the centurion, who stood facing him, saw the way he breathed his last, he said, <q>Truly this man was the son of God.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>15:40</sup>&#8239;There were also women watching from a distance. Among them were Mary Magdalene, Salome, and Mary the mother of James the younger and of Joses.
    <sup>41</sup>&#8239;Wh&shy;en he was in Galilee, they followed him, and took care of him.  Many other women had come up with him to Jerusalem.
</p>


<hr class="scene" />

<p>
    <sup>15:42</sup>&#8239;When evening had come, because it was the day before the Sabbath,
    <sup>43</sup>&#8239;Joseph of Arimathea came, a prominent member of the council, who was himself waiting for God&#x02BC;s kingdom. He boldly went to Pilate, and asked for Jesus&#x02BC;s body.
    <sup>44</sup>&#8239;Pilate was surprised that he was already dead. Summoning the centurion, he asked him whether he was already dead.
    <sup>45</sup>&#8239;Learning this from the centurion, he granted the body to Joseph.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>15:46</sup>&#8239;Joseph bought a linen cloth, took him down, wrapped him in the linen cloth, laid him in a tomb cut out of a rock, and rolled a stone against the entrance of the tomb.
    <sup>47</sup>&#8239;Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses were watching to see where he was laid.
</p>


<hr class="scene" />

<p>
    <sup>16:1</sup>&#8239;When the Sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene, Salome, and Mary the mother of James bought spices, so that they could go and anoint him.
    <sup>2</sup>&#8239;Very early on the first day of the week, when the sun had risen, they went to the tomb.
    <sup>3</sup>&#8239;They were saying to one another, <q>Who will roll away the stone from the entrance of the tomb for us?</q>
    <sup>4</sup>&#8239;Looking up, they saw that the stone had already been rolled away, although it was extremely large.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>16:5</sup>&#8239;Entering the tomb, they saw a you&shy;ng man sitting at the right, wearing a white robe; and they were alarmed.
    <sup>6</sup>&#8239;He told them, <q>Don&#x02BC;t be alarmed. You&#x02BC;re looking for Jesus the Nazarene, who was crucified. He has risen. He&#x02BC;s not here. See, here is the place where they laid him.
    <sup>7</sup>&#8239;But go, tell his disciples and Peter, <q>He&#x02BC;s going ahead of you to Galilee. You&#x02BC;ll see him there, just as he told you.</q></q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>16:8</sup>&#8239;They went out, and fled from the tomb, for trembling and astonishment had seized them.  They said nothing to anyone, because they were afraid.
