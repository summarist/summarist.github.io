<h2>My Son</h2>
<p>
    <sup>3:1</sup>&#8239;My son, don&#x02BC;t forget my teaching, but let your heart keep my commandments,
    <sup>2</sup>&#8239;for they will bring you many days, years of life, and peace.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>3:3</sup>&#8239;Don&#x02BC;t let kindness and truth leave you. Tie them around your neck. Write them on the tablet of your heart.
    <sup>4</sup>&#8239;Then you will find favor and high regard in the sight of God and man.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>3:5</sup>&#8239;Trust in <span class="small-caps">God</span> with all your heart, and don&#x02BC;t lean on your own understanding.
    <sup>6</sup>&#8239;In all your ways acknowledge him, and he will make your paths straight.
    <sup>7</sup>&#8239;Don&#x02BC;t be wise in your own eyes. Fear <span class="small-caps">God</span>, and turn away from evil.
    <sup>8</sup>&#8239;It will be healing to your body, and refreshment to your bones.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>3:9</sup>&#8239;Honor <span class="small-caps">God</span> with your wealth, and with the firstfruits of all your produce,
    <sup>10</sup>&#8239;then your barns will be filled with plenty, and your vats will overflow with new wine.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>3:11</sup>&#8239;My son, don&#x02BC;t reject the discipline of <span class="small-caps">God</span> or loathe his reproof;
    <sup>12</sup>&#8239;for <span class="small-caps">God</span> reproves the one he loves, just as a father reproves the son in whom he delights.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>3:13</sup>&#8239;Happy is the man who finds wisdom, and the man who gains understanding.
    <sup>14</sup>&#8239;For she is more profitable than silver, and her gain is better than fine gold.
    <sup>15</sup>&#8239;She is more precious than jewels, and nothing you desire compares with her.
    <sup>16</sup>&#8239;Long life is in her right hand. In her left hand are riches and honor.
    <sup>17</sup>&#8239;Her ways are pleasant, and all her paths are peaceful.
    <sup>18</sup>&#8239;She is a tree of life to those who take hold of her. Those who hold her fast are happy.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>3:19</sup>&#8239;<span class="small-caps">God</span> founded the earth by wisdom. He established the heavens by understanding.
    <sup>20</sup>&#8239;By his knowledge the depths broke open, and the clouds drip with dew.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>3:21</sup>&#8239;My son, don&#x02BC;t lose sight of them. Keep sound wisdom and discretion.
    <sup>22</sup>&#8239;Th&shy;ey will be life for your soul, and adornment for your neck.
    <sup>23</sup>&#8239;Then you will walk on your way securely, and your foot won&#x02BC;t stumble.
    <sup>24</sup>&#8239;When you lie down, you won&#x02BC;t be afraid. When you lie down, your sleep will be sweet.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>3:25</sup>&#8239;Don&#x02BC;t fear sudden disaster or the ruin of the wicked when it comes,
    <sup>26</sup>&#8239;for <span class="small-caps">God</span> will be your confidence, and will keep your foot from being caught.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>3:27</sup>&#8239;Don&#x02BC;t withhold good from those who deserve it, when it is in your power to do it.
    <sup>28</sup>&#8239;Don&#x02BC;t say to your neighbor, <q>Go, and come back. I&#x02BC;ll give it tomorrow,</q> when you have it with you.
    <sup>29</sup>&#8239;Don&#x02BC;t plan evil against your neighbor, who lives trustingly beside you.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>3:30</sup>&#8239;Don&#x02BC;t contend with a man without cause, when he has done you no harm.
    <sup>31</sup>&#8239;Don&#x02BC;t envy a violent man or choose any of his ways,
    <sup>32</sup>&#8239;for the devious are an abomination to <span class="small-caps">God</span>, but he is a friend to the upright.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>3:33</sup>&#8239;The curse of <span class="small-caps">God</span> is on the house of the wicked, but he blesses the dwelling of the righteous.
    <sup>34</sup>&#8239;He mocks the mockers, but shows favor to the humble.
    <sup>35</sup>&#8239;The wise will inherit honor, but fools get shame.
</p>


<hr class="scene" />

<p>
    <sup>4:1</sup>&#8239;Listen, sons, to a father&#x02BC;s instruction, and pay attention so that you may gain understanding.
    <sup>2</sup>&#8239;For I give you sound instruction. Don&#x02BC;t abandon my teaching.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>4:3</sup>&#8239;When I was a son to my father, tender and the only son in my mother&#x02BC;s sight,
    <sup>4</sup>&#8239;he taught me, and said to me: <q>Let your heart hold on to my words. Keep my commandments and live.
    <sup>5</sup>&#8239;Get wisdom. Get understanding. Don&#x02BC;t forget or turn away from the words of my mouth.
    <sup>6</sup>&#8239;Don&#x02BC;t forsake her, and she will guard you. Love her, and she will watch over you.
    <sup>7</sup>&#8239;The beginning of wisdom is this: Get wisdom, and whatever else you get, get understanding.
    <sup>8</sup>&#8239;Prize her, and she will exalt you. If you embrace her, she will honor you.
    <sup>9</sup>&#8239;She will place on your head a garland of grace. She will present you with a crown of beauty.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>4:10</sup>&#8239;Listen, my son, and accept my sayings, and the years of your life will be many.
    <sup>11</sup>&#8239;I have taught you in the way of wisdom. I have led you in upright paths.
    <sup>12</sup>&#8239;When you walk, your steps won&#x02BC;t be hindered. When you run, you won&#x02BC;t stumble.
    <sup>13</sup>&#8239;Hold on to instruction. Don&#x02BC;t let go. Guard her, for she is your life.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>4:14</sup>&#8239;Don&#x02BC;t enter the path of the wicked, and don&#x02BC;t walk in the way of evil men.
    <sup>15</sup>&#8239;Avoid it. Don&#x02BC;t travel on it. Turn away from it, and pass on.
    <sup>16</sup>&#8239;For they cannot sleep unless they do evil. They are robbed of sleep unless they make someone stumble.
    <sup>17</sup>&#8239;For they eat the bread of wickedness, and drink the wine of violence.
    <sup>18</sup>&#8239;But the path of the righteous is like the light of dawn, which shines brighter and brighter until midday.
    <sup>19</sup>&#8239;The way of the wicked is like darkness. They don&#x02BC;t know what makes them stumble.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>4:20</sup>&#8239;My son, pay attention to my words. Listen carefully to my sayings.
    <sup>21</sup>&#8239;Don&#x02BC;t lose sight of them. Keep them within your heart.
    <sup>22</sup>&#8239;For they are life to those who find them, and health to their whole body.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>4:23</sup>&#8239;Watch over your heart with all diligence, for the springs of life flow from it.
    <sup>24</sup>&#8239;Put away from you deceitful speech, and put devious talk far from you.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>4:25</sup>&#8239;Let your eyes look directly ahead and your gaze straight in front of you.
    <sup>26</sup>&#8239;Carefully consider the path of your feet, then all your ways will be sure.
    <sup>27</sup>&#8239;Don&#x02BC;t turn to the right or to the left. Keep your foot from evil.
</p>


<hr class="scene" />

<p>
    <sup>5:1</sup>&#8239;My son, pay attention to my wisdom. Listen carefully to my understanding,
    <sup>2</sup>&#8239;that you may maintain discretion, and that your lips may guard knowledge.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>5:3</sup>&#8239;The lips of a forbidden woman drip honey, and her speech is smoo&shy;ther than oil,
    <sup>4</sup>&#8239;but in the end she&#x02BC;s as bitter as wormwood, and as sharp as a double-edged sword.
    <sup>5</sup>&#8239;Her feet go down to death. Her steps lead straight to hell.
    <sup>6</sup>&#8239;She doesn&#x02BC;t ponder the path of life. Her ways are unstable, and she doesn&#x02BC;t know it.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>5:7</sup>&#8239;Now then, my sons, listen to me, and don&#x02BC;t depart from the words of my mouth.
    <sup>8</sup>&#8239;Keep your way far from her. Don&#x02BC;t go near the door of her house
    <sup>9</sup>&#8239;lest you give your vigor to others and your years to someone cruel,
    <sup>10</sup>&#8239;lest strangers feast on your wealth, your labors enrich the house of a foreigner,
    <sup>11</sup>&#8239;and at the end of your life you groan when your flesh and body are consumed.
    <sup>12</sup>&#8239;You will say, <q>How I hated discipline! How my heart despised reproof!
    <sup>13</sup>&#8239;I didn&#x02BC;t obey my teachers or listen to my instructors!
    <sup>14</sup>&#8239;I am almost in utter ruin in the midst of the assembly and congregation.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>5:15</sup>&#8239;Drink water from your own cistern, and fresh water from your own well.
    <sup>16</sup>&#8239;Should your springs be scattered abroad, streams of water in the streets?
    <sup>17</sup>&#8239;Let them be yours alone, and not for strangers with you.
    <sup>18</sup>&#8239;Let your fountain be blessed, and rejoice in the wife of your youth,
    <sup>19</sup>&#8239;as a loving deer and a graceful doe. Let her breasts satisfy you always, and be exhilarated always with her love.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>5:20</sup>&#8239;Why, my son, should you be exhilarated with a forbidden woman, or embrace the bosom of a stranger?
    <sup>21</sup>&#8239;For a man&#x02BC;s ways are before the eyes of <span class="small-caps">God</span>, and he considers all his paths.
    <sup>22</sup>&#8239;The iniquities of the wicked entrap him. He is held in the cords of his sin.
    <sup>23</sup>&#8239;He dies for lack of discipline, and because of his great folly he will go astray.
</p>


<hr class="scene" />

<p>
    <sup>6:1</sup>&#8239;My son, if you have put up security for your neighbor or have given a pledge for a stranger,
    <sup>2</sup>&#8239;if you have been snared or caught with the words of your mouth,
    <sup>3</sup>&#8239;then do this, my son, and free yourself. You have fallen into your neighbor&#x02BC;s hands. Go, humble yourself, and plead with your neighbor.
    <sup>4</sup>&#8239;Give your eyes no sleep and your eyelids no slumber.
    <sup>5</sup>&#8239;Save yourself like a gazelle from the hunter&#x02BC;s hand, and like a bird from the fowler&#x02BC;s hand.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>6:6</sup>&#8239;Go to the ant, you idler. Observe its ways, and be wise.
    <sup>7</sup>&#8239;With&shy;out chief, officer, or ruler,
    <sup>8</sup>&#8239;it prepares its provisions in summer, and gathers its food during harvest.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>6:9</sup>&#8239;How long will you lie down, you idler? When will you get up from your sleep?
    <sup>10</sup>&#8239;A little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to rest,
    <sup>11</sup>&#8239;and poverty will come upon you like a robber, and want like an armed man.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>6:12</sup>&#8239;A worthless person, a wicked man, goes around speaking perversely.
    <sup>14</sup>&#8239;With perversity in his heart, he devises evil continually, and sows discord.
    <sup>15</sup>&#8239;There&shy;fore calamity will strike him suddenly. Instantly he will be broken beyond healing.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>6:16</sup>&#8239;Seven things are an abomination to <span class="small-caps">God</span>:
    <sup>17</sup>&#8239;hau&shy;gh&shy;ty eyes, a lying tongue, hands that shed innocent blood,
    <sup>18</sup>&#8239;a heart that devises wicked plans, feet that run swiftly to evil,
    <sup>19</sup>&#8239;a false witness who utters lies, and one who sows discord among brothers.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>6:20</sup>&#8239;My son, keep your father&#x02BC;s command, and don&#x02BC;t forsake your mother&#x02BC;s teaching.
    <sup>21</sup>&#8239;Always bind them on your heart. Tie them around your neck.
    <sup>22</sup>&#8239;Wh&shy;en you walk, they will guide you. When you sleep, they will watch over you. When you wake up, they will talk to you.
    <sup>23</sup>&#8239;For this command is a lamp, this teaching is a light, and corrective discipline is the way to life,
    <sup>24</sup>&#8239;keeping you from the evil woman, from the flattering tongue of an adulteress.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>6:25</sup>&#8239;Don&#x02BC;t desire her beauty in your heart or let her captivate you with her eyes.
    <sup>26</sup>&#8239;For a prostitute&#x02BC;s fee is only a loaf of bread, but a married woman hunts down a precious life.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>6:27</sup>&#8239;Can a man embrace fire without burning his clothes?
    <sup>28</sup>&#8239;Or can he walk on hot coals without scorching his feet?
    <sup>29</sup>&#8239;So is he who goes in to his neighbor&#x02BC;s wife. None who touches her will go unpunished.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>6:30</sup>&#8239;People don&#x02BC;t despise a thief if he steals to satisfy his hunger,
    <sup>31</sup>&#8239;but if caught, he must repay sevenfold. He will give everything in his house.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>6:32</sup>&#8239;He who commits adultery lacks sen&shy;se, and destroys himself.
    <sup>33</sup>&#8239;He will get wounds and dishonor, and his disgrace won&#x02BC;t be erased.
    <sup>34</sup>&#8239;For jealousy enrages a husband, and he will show no mercy in the day of vengeance.
    <sup>35</sup>&#8239;He won&#x02BC;t accept compensation. He will refuse, though you give many gifts.
</p>


<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>
    <sup>7:10</sup>&#8239;A woman met him, dressed as a prostitute, and cunning of heart.
    <sup>13</sup>&#8239;She seizes him, kisses him, and brazenly says to him,
    <sup>14</sup>&#8239;<q>I had to offer peace offerings. Today I&#x02BC;ve paid my vows.
    <sup>16</sup>&#8239;I&#x02BC;ve spread my couch with coverings, with colored linens from Egypt.
    <sup>18</sup>&#8239;Come, let&#x02BC;s drink our fill of love until morning. Let&#x02BC;s delight ourselves with caresses.</q>
    <sup>21</sup>&#8239;She seduces him with her persuasive speech. With her flattering lips she lures him.
    <sup>22</sup>&#8239;He follows her at once, like an ox going to the slaughter, like a deer stepping into a trap.
    <sup>25</sup>&#8239;Don&#x02BC;t let your heart turn aside to her ways. Don&#x02BC;t stray into her paths.
    <sup>26</sup>&#8239;For she has cast down many victims, and all her slain are numerous.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>11:29</sup>&#8239;He who troubles his own house will inherit the wind.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>12:4</sup>&#8239;An excellent wife is her husband&#x02BC;s crown, but she who brings shame is like rottenness in his bones.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>13:20</sup>&#8239;He who walks with wise men will become wise, but the companion of fools will suffer harm.
    <sup>24</sup>&#8239;He who spares the rod hates his son, but he who loves him disciplines him diligently.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>14:7</sup>&#8239;Leave the presence of a fool, for you won&#x02BC;t find knowledge in his speech.
    <sup>28</sup>&#8239;A large population is a king&#x02BC;s glory, but without people a prince is ruined.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>15:17</sup>&#8239;Better is a serving of vegetables where there is love, than a fattened ox served with hatred.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>16:7</sup>&#8239;When a man&#x02BC;s ways please <span class="small-caps">God</span>, he makes even his enemies to be at peace with him.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>17:6</sup>&#8239;Grandchildren are the crown of old men, and fathers are the glory of their sons.
    <sup>9</sup>&#8239;He who conceals an offense seeks love, but he who repeats a matter separates close friends.
    <sup>12</sup>&#8239;Let a man meet a bear robbed of her cubs, rather than a fool in his folly.
    <sup>17</sup>&#8239;A friend loves at all times, and a brother is born for adversity.
    <sup>21</sup>&#8239;He who sires a fool does so to his own sorrow, and the father of a fool has no joy.
    <sup>25</sup>&#8239;A foolish son is a grief to his father, and bitterness to her who bore him.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>18:1</sup>&#8239;He who isolates himself seeks his own desire, and rebels against all sound wisdom.
    <sup>22</sup>&#8239;He who finds a wife finds a good thing, and obtains favor from <span class="small-caps">God</span>.
    <sup>24</sup>&#8239;He who has many friends comes to ruin, but there is a friend who stays closer than a brother.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>19:13</sup>&#8239;A foolish son is ruin to his father, and a wife&#x02BC;s contentions are a constant dripping.
    <sup>14</sup>&#8239;A house and wealth are inherited from fathers, but a prudent wife is from <span class="small-caps">God</span>.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>20:2</sup>&#8239;A king&#x02BC;s terror is like the lion&#x02BC;s roar; he who provokes him to anger forfeits his own life.
    <sup>19</sup>&#8239;A gossip reveals secrets, therefore don&#x02BC;t associate with him who talks too much.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>22:6</sup>&#8239;Train up a child in the way he should go; even when he is old he won&#x02BC;t depart from it.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>25:17</sup>&#8239;Seldom set foot in your neighbor&#x02BC;s house, lest he grow weary of you, and hate you.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>29:3</sup>&#8239;He who loves wisdom brings joy to his father, but a companion of prostitutes wastes his wealth.
</p>


<h2>Instruction</h2>
<p>
    <sup>8:1</sup>&#8239;Doesn&#x02BC;t wisdom call, and understanding raise her voice?
    <sup>4</sup>&#8239;<q>To you, O men, I call, and my voice is to the sons of men.
    <sup>5</sup>&#8239;O naive ones, learn prudence. O fools, learn sense.
    <sup>10</sup>&#8239;Take my instruction instead of silver, and knowledge rather than choice gold.
    <sup>11</sup>&#8239;For wisdom is better than jewels, and all desirable things cannot compare to it.
    <sup>22</sup>&#8239;<span class="small-caps">God</span> possessed me at the beginning of his way, before his works of old.
    <sup>27</sup>&#8239;When he established the heavens, I was there.
    <sup>32</sup>&#8239;Now, my sons, listen to me, for blessed are those who keep my ways.
    <sup>33</sup>&#8239;Listen to instruction and be wise. Don&#x02BC;t neglect it.
    <sup>35</sup>&#8239;For he who finds me finds life, and will obtain favor of <span class="small-caps">God</span>.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>9:8</sup>&#8239;Don&#x02BC;t reprove a scoffer, or he will hate you. Reprove a wise man, and he will love you.
    <sup>9</sup>&#8239;Instruct a wise man, and he will be wiser still. Teach a righteous man, and he will increase in learning.
    <sup>10</sup>&#8239;The fear of <span class="small-caps">God</span> is the beginning of wisdom. Knowledge of the Holy One is understanding.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>10:8</sup>&#8239;The wise of heart will receive commands, but a babbling fool will be ruined.
    <sup>17</sup>&#8239;He who heeds instruction is on the path of life, but he who ignores reproof goes astray.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>12:1</sup>&#8239;Whoever loves discipline loves kn&shy;owl&shy;edge, but he who hates reproof is stupid.
    <sup>15</sup>&#8239;The fool&#x02BC;s way is right in his own eyes, but a wise man listens to counsel.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>13:1</sup>&#8239;A wise son hears his father&#x02BC;s instruction, but a scoffer doesn&#x02BC;t listen to rebuke.
    <sup>10</sup>&#8239;Insolence brings only strife, but wisdom is with those who take advice.
    <sup>13</sup>&#8239;Whoever despises instruction will pay the penalty, but he who respects a command will be rewarded.
    <sup>14</sup>&#8239;The teaching of the wise is a fountain of life, turning one away from the snares of death.
    <sup>18</sup>&#8239;Poverty and shame will come to him who ignores instruction, but he who heeds reproof will be honored.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>15:5</sup>&#8239;A fool despises his father&#x02BC;s instruction, but he who heeds reproof is prudent.
    <sup>10</sup>&#8239;There is harsh discipline for him who forsakes the way, and he who hates reproof will die.
    <sup>31</sup>&#8239;The ear that listens to life-giving reproof will dwell among the wise.
    <sup>32</sup>&#8239;He who ignores instruction despises himself, but he who listens to reproof gains understanding.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>17:10</sup>&#8239;A rebuke goes deeper into one who has understanding than a hundred lashes into a fool.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>19:27</sup>&#8239;Cease listening to instruction, my son, and you will stray from the words of knowledge.
</p>


<h2>Wise and Foolish</h2>
<p>
    <sup>10:1</sup>&#8239;A wise son makes a father glad, but a foolish son brings grief to his mother.
    <sup>23</sup>&#8239;Doing wickedness is like sport to a fool, but wisdom is pleasure to a man of understanding.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>11:29</sup>&#8239;He who troubles his own household will inherit the wind, and the fool will be servant to the wise of heart.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>12:8</sup>&#8239;A man is praised according to his insight, but one of twisted mind is despised.
    <sup>16</sup>&#8239;A fool&#x02BC;s displeasure is known at once, but a prudent man ignores an insult.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>14:15</sup>&#8239;The naive believes everything, but the prudent considers his steps.
    <sup>16</sup>&#8239;A wise man is cautious and turns away from evil, but a fool is reckless and careless.
    <sup>35</sup>&#8239;The king favors a servant who acts wisely, but his wrath falls on one who acts shamefully.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>15:7</sup>&#8239;The lips of the wise spread knowledge, but not so the hearts of fools.
    <sup>20</sup>&#8239;A wise son makes a father glad, but a foolish man despises his mother.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>17:2</sup>&#8239;A prudent servant will rule over a shameful son, and will share the inheritance among the brothers.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>22:3</sup>&#8239;The prudent sees danger and hides himself, but the naive go on and suffer for it.
</p>


<h2>Righteous and Wicked</h2>
<p>
    <sup>10:2</sup>&#8239;Ill-gotten gains do not profit, but righteousness delivers from death.
    <sup>3</sup>&#8239;<span class="small-caps">God</span> will not let the righteous go hungry, but he thwarts the craving of the wicked.
    <sup>6</sup>&#8239;Bless&shy;ings are on the head of the righteous, but the mouth of the wicked conceals violence.
    <sup>7</sup>&#8239;The memory of the righteous is a blessing, but the name of the wicked will rot.
    <sup>16</sup>&#8239;The wages of the righteous is life; the gain of the wicked is punishment.
    <sup>20</sup>&#8239;The tongue of the righteous is like choice silver; the heart of the wicked is of little worth.
    <sup>21</sup>&#8239;The lips of the righteous feed many, but fools die for lack of sense.
    <sup>24</sup>&#8239;What the wicked dreads will come upon him, but the desire of the righteous will be granted.
    <sup>27</sup>&#8239;The fear of <span class="small-caps">God</span> prolongs life, but the years of the wicked will be shortened.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>11:5</sup>&#8239;The righteousness of the blameless will direct his way, but the wicked will fall by his own wickedness.
    <sup>6</sup>&#8239;The righteousness of the upright will rescue them, but the treacherous will be trapped by their own desires.
    <sup>8</sup>&#8239;The righteous is delivered from trouble, but the wicked takes his place.
    <sup>18</sup>&#8239;The wicked earns deceptive wages, but he who sows righteousness gets a sure reward.
    <sup>23</sup>&#8239;The desire of the righteous turns out well, but the expectation of the wicked is wrath.
    <sup>27</sup>&#8239;He who diligently seeks good seeks favor, but evil comes to him who searches for it.
    <sup>31</sup>&#8239;If the righteous will be rewarded on earth, how much more the wicked and the sinner.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>12:3</sup>&#8239;A man will not be established by wickedness, but the root of the righteous will not be moved.
    <sup>5</sup>&#8239;The thoughts of the righteous are just, but the counsels of the wicked are deceitful.
    <sup>7</sup>&#8239;The wicked are overthrown and are no more, but the house of the righteous will stand.
    <sup>21</sup>&#8239;No harm befalls the righteous, but the wicked are filled with evil.
    <sup>26</sup>&#8239;The righteous is a guide to his neighbor, but the way of the wicked leads them astray.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>13:9</sup>&#8239;The light of the righteous shines brightly, but the lamp of the wicked will be put out.
    <sup>21</sup>&#8239;Disaster pursues sinners, but the righteous will be rewarded with good.
    <sup>25</sup>&#8239;The righteous has enough to satisfy his appetite, but the stomach of the wicked is empty.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>14:11</sup>&#8239;The house of the wicked will be destroyed, but the tent of the upright will flourish.
    <sup>19</sup>&#8239;The evil bow down before the good, and the wicked at the gates of the righteous.
    <sup>22</sup>&#8239;Won&#x02BC;t they who devise evil go astray? But those who devise good will find kindness and truth.
    <sup>34</sup>&#8239;Righteousness exalts a nation, but sin is a disgrace to any people.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>15:8</sup>&#8239;The sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination to <span class="small-caps">God</span>, but the prayer of the upright is his delight.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>21:15</sup>&#8239;When justice is done, it is a joy to the righteous, but a terror to evildoers.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>22:5</sup>&#8239;Thorns and snares are in the way of the crooked. He who guards himself will be far from them.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>28:1</sup>&#8239;The wicked flee when no one pursues, but the righteous are as bold as a lion.
</p>


<h2>Diligence</h2>
<p>
    <sup>10:4</sup>&#8239;A slack hand causes poverty, but a diligent hand makes rich.
    <sup>5</sup>&#8239;A son who gathers in the summer is prudent, but one who sleeps during harvest is shameful.
    <sup>26</sup>&#8239;Like vinegar to the teeth and smoke to the eyes, so is the idler to those who send him.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>12:11</sup>&#8239;He who works his land will have plenty of bread, but he who follows worthless pursuits lacks sense.
    <sup>24</sup>&#8239;The hand of the diligent will rule, but the slothful will be put to forced labor.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>13:4</sup>&#8239;The idler craves, yet gets nothing, but the diligent is fully satisfied.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>14:23</sup>&#8239;There is profit in all labor, but mere talk leads only to poverty.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>15:19</sup>&#8239;The way of the idler is like a hedge of thorns, but the path of the upright is a highway.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>16:3</sup>&#8239;Commit your work to <span class="small-caps">God</span>, and your plans will be established.
    <sup>26</sup>&#8239;A work&shy;er&#x02BC;s appetite works for him, for his hunger urges him on.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>18:9</sup>&#8239;Whoever is slack in his work is brother to him who destroys.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>19:15</sup>&#8239;Laziness brings on deep sleep, and an idle man will suffer hunger.
    <sup>24</sup>&#8239;The idler buries his hand in the dish, but will not even bring it back to his mouth.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>20:4</sup>&#8239;The idler doesn&#x02BC;t plow in season, so he looks during harvest, and has nothing.
    <sup>13</sup>&#8239;Don&#x02BC;t love sleep, lest you come to poverty.  Open your eyes, and you will have plenty of food.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>21:25</sup>&#8239;The desire of the idler kills him, for his hands refuse to work.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>22:13</sup>&#8239;The idler says, <q>There&#x02BC;s a lion outside. I&#x02BC;ll be killed in the streets.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>26:14</sup>&#8239;As a door turns on its hinges, so does the idler on his bed.
    <sup>16</sup>&#8239;The idler is wiser in his own eyes than seven men who can answer sensibly.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>27:23</sup>&#8239;Know well the condition of your flocks, and pay attention to your herds;
    <sup>24</sup>&#8239;for riches aren&#x02BC;t forever and a crown doesn&#x02BC;t endure to all generations.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>28:19</sup>&#8239;He who works his land will have plenty of food, but he who follows worthless pursuits will have plenty of poverty.
</p>


<h2>Integrity</h2>
<p>
    <sup>10:9</sup>&#8239;He who walks in integrity walks securely, but he who perverts his ways will be found out.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>11:3</sup>&#8239;The integrity of the upright will guide them, but the perversity of the trea&shy;ch&shy;er&shy;ous will destroy them.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>20:7</sup>&#8239;A righteous man who walks in his integrity; blessed are his children after him.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>21:27</sup>&#8239;The sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination; how much more when he brings it with evil intent.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>28:6</sup>&#8239;Better is the poor who walks in his integrity, than the rich who is crooked in his ways.
    <sup>18</sup>&#8239;He who walks in integrity will be delivered, but he who is crooked will suddenly fall.
</p>


<h2>Speech</h2>
<p>
    <sup>10:11</sup>&#8239;The mouth of the righteous is a fountain of life, but the mouth of the wicked conceals violence.
    <sup>18</sup>&#8239;He who conceals hatred has lying lips, and he who spreads slander is a fool.
    <sup>19</sup>&#8239;When there are many words, transgression is unavoidable, but he who restrains his lips is wise.
    <sup>31</sup>&#8239;The mouth of the righteous brings forth wisdom, but the perverse tongue will be cut out.
    <sup>32</sup>&#8239;The lips of the righteous know what is acceptable, but the mouth of the wicked what is perverse.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>11:12</sup>&#8239;He who belittles his neighbor lacks sense, but a man of understanding remains silent.
    <sup>13</sup>&#8239;A gossip goes about revealing secrets, but he who is trustworthy conceals a matter.
    <sup>22</sup>&#8239;A beautiful woman without discretion is like a gold ring in a pig&#x02BC;s snout.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>12:13</sup>&#8239;An evil man is ensnared by the transgression of his lips, but the righteous will escape from trouble.
    <sup>18</sup>&#8239;There is one who speaks rashly like thrusts of a sword, but the tongue of the wise brings healing.
    <sup>23</sup>&#8239;A prudent man conceals knowledge, but a fool&#x02BC;s heart proclaims folly.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>13:3</sup>&#8239;He who guards his mouth preserves his life, but he who opens wide his lips comes to ruin.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>14:3</sup>&#8239;In the fool&#x02BC;s mouth is a rod for his back, but the lips of the wise will protect them.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>15:1</sup>&#8239;A gentle answer turns away wrath, but a harsh word stirs up anger.
    <sup>4</sup>&#8239;A soothing tongue is a tree of life, but a perverse tongue breaks the spirit.
    <sup>23</sup>&#8239;A man finds joy in giving an apt answer, and a timely word, how good it is!
    <sup>28</sup>&#8239;The heart of the righteous ponders how to answer, but the mouth of the wicked blurts out evil things.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>16:23</sup>&#8239;The heart of the wise instructs his mouth, and adds persuasion to his lips.
    <sup>24</sup>&#8239;Pleasant words are a honeycomb: sweet to the soul, and health to the body.
    <sup>28</sup>&#8239;A perverse man spreads strife, and a gossip separates close friends.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>17:7</sup>&#8239;Excellent speech is not fitting for a fool, much less lying lips for a prince.
    <sup>27</sup>&#8239;He who restrains his words has knowledge, and he who has a cool spirit is a man of understanding.
    <sup>28</sup>&#8239;Even a fool is considered wise when he keeps silent. When he closes his lips, he is considered prudent.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>18:2</sup>&#8239;A fool does not delight in understanding, but only in airing his opinion.
    <sup>6</sup>&#8239;A fool&#x02BC;s lips bring strife, and his mouth invites a beating.
    <sup>7</sup>&#8239;A fool&#x02BC;s mouth is his ruin, and his lips are the snare of his soul.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>20:15</sup>&#8239;There is gold, and an abundance of jewels, but lips of knowledge are a rare treasure.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>21:23</sup>&#8239;He who guards his mouth and ton&shy;gue keeps himself out of trouble.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>22:11</sup>&#8239;He who loves purity of heart, and speaks graciously will have the king as a friend.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>26:18</sup>&#8239;Like a madman who throws firebrands, arrows, and death,
    <sup>19</sup>&#8239;is the man who deceives his neighbor, and says, <q>I was only joking!</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>27:14</sup>&#8239;He who blesses his neighbor with a loud voice early in the morning will be counted as cursing.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>29:20</sup>&#8239;Do you see a man who is hasty in his words? There is more hope for a fool than for him.
</p>


<h2>Contention</h2>
<p>
    <sup>10:12</sup>&#8239;Hatred stirs up conflict, but love covers all offenses.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>15:18</sup>&#8239;A hot-tempered man stirs up conflict, but the slow to anger calms contention.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>17:14</sup>&#8239;Starting a conflict is like releasing a flood, so abandon the dispute before it breaks out.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>18:18</sup>&#8239;Casting the lot ends quarrels, and decides between powerful opponents.
    <sup>19</sup>&#8239;An offended brother is harder to win than a strong city, and contentions are like the bars of a castle.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>20:3</sup>&#8239;Staying away from strife is an honor for a man, but any fool will quarrel.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>21:9</sup>&#8239;It&#x02BC;s better to live in a corner of the roof than in a house shared with a contentious woman.
    <sup>19</sup>&#8239;It&#x02BC;s better to live in a desert than with a contentious and complaining woman.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>22:10</sup>&#8239;Drive out the mocker, and contention will depart, and quarrels and dishonor will cease.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>26:20</sup>&#8239;Without wood the fire goes out, and without a gossip contention dies down.
    <sup>21</sup>&#8239;Like charcoal to hot embers and wood to fire, so is a contentious man for kindling strife.
</p>


<h2>Understanding</h2>
<p>
    <sup>10:13</sup>&#8239;Wisdom is found on the lips of the discerning, but a rod is for the back of him who lacks sense.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>13:16</sup>&#8239;Every prudent man works with knowledge, but a fool flaunts his folly.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>14:12</sup>&#8239;There is a way that seems right to a man, but its end is the way to death.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>16:16</sup>&#8239;How much better to get wisdom than gold. To get understanding is preferable to silver.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>18:13</sup>&#8239;He who answers before he listens: it is folly and shame to him.
    <sup>15</sup>&#8239;The mind of the prudent acquires knowledge, and the ear of the wise seeks knowledge.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>19:2</sup>&#8239;Enthusiasm without knowledge is not good, and hasty feet go astray.
    <sup>8</sup>&#8239;He who gets wisdom loves his own soul. He who keeps understanding will find good.
    <sup>20</sup>&#8239;Listen to counsel and receive instruction so that you may be wise the rest of your days.
</p>


<h2>Honesty</h2>
<p>
    <sup>11:1</sup>&#8239;Dishonest scales are an abomination to <span class="small-caps">God</span>, but an accurate weight is his delight.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>12:19</sup>&#8239;Truthful lips endure forever, but a lying tongue is only for a moment.
    <sup>22</sup>&#8239;Lying lips are an abomination to <span class="small-caps">God</span>, but those who act faithfully are his delight.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>16:11</sup>&#8239;A just balance and scales belong to <span class="small-caps">God</span>, all the weights in the bag are his concern.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>17:13</sup>&#8239;If anyone returns evil for good, evil will never leave his house.
    <sup>15</sup>&#8239;Ac&shy;quit&shy;ting the guilty, and condemning the righteous are both alike an abomination to <span class="small-caps">God</span>.
    <sup>23</sup>&#8239;A wicked man takes a bribe in secret to pervert the ways of justice.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>18:5</sup>&#8239;Being partial to the wicked is not good, neither is depriving the righteous of justice.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>19:5</sup>&#8239;A false witness will not go unpunished, and he who speaks lies will not escape.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>20:10</sup>&#8239;Differing weights and differing measures, are both alike an abomination to <span class="small-caps">God</span>.
    <sup>17</sup>&#8239;Br&shy;ead gained by deceit is sweet to a man, but afterward his mouth will be full of gravel.
    <sup>23</sup>&#8239;Differing weights are an abomination to <span class="small-caps">God</span>, and a false scale is not good.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>21:3</sup>&#8239;To do righteousness and justice is more acceptable to <span class="small-caps">God</span> than sacrifice.
</p>


<h2>Humility</h2>
<p>
    <sup>11:2</sup>&#8239;When pride comes, then comes disgrace, but with the humble is wisdom.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>12:9</sup>&#8239;Better is he who is lightly esteemed, and has a servant, than he that honors himself, and lacks bread.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>15:25</sup>&#8239;<span class="small-caps">God</span> will tear down the house of the proud, but will protect the borders of the widow.
    <sup>33</sup>&#8239;Wisdom teaches the fear of <span class="small-caps">God</span>, and humility comes before honor.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>16:5</sup>&#8239;Everyone who is proud in heart is an abomination to <span class="small-caps">God</span>; be assured, he will not go unpunished.
    <sup>18</sup>&#8239;Pride comes before destruction, and an arrogant spirit before a fall.
    <sup>19</sup>&#8239;It is better to be humble in spirit among the lowly, than to divide the spoil with the proud.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>18:12</sup>&#8239;Before destruction a man&#x02BC;s heart is haughty, but humility comes before honor.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>21:30</sup>&#8239;No wisdom, no understanding, and no counsel will prevail against <span class="small-caps">God</span>.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>22:4</sup>&#8239;The reward for humility and fear of <span class="small-caps">God</span> is riches, honor, and life.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>26:12</sup>&#8239;Do you see a man wise in his own eyes? There is more hope for a fool than for him.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>27:1</sup>&#8239;Don&#x02BC;t boast about tomorrow, for you don&#x02BC;t know what a day may bring.
    <sup>2</sup>&#8239;Let another praise you, and not your own mouth; a stranger, and not your own lips.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>29:23</sup>&#8239;A man&#x02BC;s pride will bring him low, but a humble spirit will obtain honor.
</p>


<h2>Finance</h2>
<p>
    <sup>11:15</sup>&#8239;He who is guarantor for a stranger will surely suffer for it, but he who hates such agreements is secure.
    <sup>28</sup>&#8239;He who trusts in his riches will fall, but the righteous will flourish like a green leaf.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>13:7</sup>&#8239;There is one who pretends to be rich, yet has nothing. Another pretends to be poor, yet has great wealth.
    <sup>11</sup>&#8239;Wealth obtained by fraud will dwindle, but he who gathers by labor will increase it.
    <sup>22</sup>&#8239;A good man leaves an inheritance to his children&#x02BC;s children, but the sinner&#x02BC;s wealth is stored up for the righteous.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>14:4</sup>&#8239;Where there are no oxen, the manger is clean, but abundant harvest comes through an ox&#x02BC;s strength.
    <sup>20</sup>&#8239;The poor is hated even by his neighbor, but there are many who love the rich.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>15:6</sup>&#8239;There is great wealth in the house of the righteous, but trouble accompanies the income of the wicked.
    <sup>16</sup>&#8239;Better a little with fear of <span class="small-caps">God</span> than great treasure with turmoil.
    <sup>27</sup>&#8239;He who profits illicitly troubles his own house, but he who hates bribes will live.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>16:8</sup>&#8239;Better a little with righteousness than great income with injustice.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>19:4</sup>&#8239;Wealth attracts many friends, but a poor man is separated from his friend.
    <sup>6</sup>&#8239;Many seek a generous man&#x02BC;s favor, and everyone is a friend to him who gives gifts.
    <sup>7</sup>&#8239;All a poor man&#x02BC;s brothers hate him. How much more do his friends avoid him! He pursues them with words, but they are gone.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>20:25</sup>&#8239;It is a snare to say rashly, <q>It is holy,</q> and only make inquiry after the vows.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>21:5</sup>&#8239;The plans of the diligent lead surely to abundance, but everyone who is hasty comes surely to poverty.
    <sup>6</sup>&#8239;Acquiring treasures by a lying tongue is a fleeting vapor and the pursuit of death.
    <sup>17</sup>&#8239;He who loves pleasure will become poor. He who loves wine and oil will not get rich.
    <sup>20</sup>&#8239;There is precious treasure and oil in a wise man&#x02BC;s dwelling, but a fool consumes them.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>22:1</sup>&#8239;A good name is to be chosen over great riches, and favor over silver and gold.
    <sup>2</sup>&#8239;The rich and the poor have this in common: <span class="small-caps">God</span> is the maker of them all.
    <sup>7</sup>&#8239;The rich rules over the poor, and the borrower is a slave to the lender.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>26:10</sup>&#8239;Like an archer who wounds everyone, so is he who hires a fool or who hires those passing by.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>28:22</sup>&#8239;A stingy man hastens after wealth, and doesn&#x02BC;t know that poverty will come upon him.
</p>


<h2>Kindness</h2>
<p>
    <sup>11:17</sup>&#8239;A kind man benefits himself, but a cruel man harms himself.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>12:10</sup>&#8239;A righteous man has regard for the life of his animal, but even the mercy of the wicked is cruel.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>14:21</sup>&#8239;He who despises his neighbor sins, but he who shows kindness to the poor is happy.
    <sup>31</sup>&#8239;He who oppresses the poor insults his maker, but he who is kind to the needy honors him.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>21:21</sup>&#8239;He who pursues righteousness and kindness will find life, righteousness, and honor.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>26:27</sup>&#8239;He who digs a pit will fall into it, and he who rolls a stone, it will come back on him.
</p>


<h2>Generosity</h2>
<p>
    <sup>11:24</sup>&#8239;One gives freely, yet increases all the more, and another withholds what is due, but comes only to poverty.
    <sup>25</sup>&#8239;The generous man will prosper, and he who waters will also be watered himself.
    <sup>26</sup>&#8239;The people will curse him who withholds grain, but a blessing is on the head of him who sells it.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>19:17</sup>&#8239;Kindness to the poor is a loan to <span class="small-caps">God</span>, and he will repay his good deed.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>21:13</sup>&#8239;He who shuts his ear to the cry of the poor will also call out and not be answered.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>22:9</sup>&#8239;He who is generous will be blessed, for he shares his bread with the poor.
    <sup>16</sup>&#8239;He who oppresses the poor to increase his wealth, or who gives to the rich, will only come to poverty.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>25:21</sup>&#8239;If your enemy is hungry, give him bread to eat, and if he is thirsty, give him water to drink.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>27:7</sup>&#8239;He who is full loathes honey, but to the hungry any bitter thing is sweet.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>28:27</sup>&#8239;He who gives to the poor will never want, but he who hides his eyes will have many curses.
</p>


<h2>Emotion</h2>
<p>
    <sup>12:25</sup>&#8239;Anxiety in a man&#x02BC;s heart weighs it down, but a good word makes it glad.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>13:12</sup>&#8239;Hope deferred makes the heart sick, but desire fulfilled is a tree of life.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>14:13</sup>&#8239;Even in laughter the heart may ache, and joy may end in grief.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>14:17</sup>&#8239;A man of quick temper acts foolishly, and a man of evil schemes is hated.
    <sup>29</sup>&#8239;He who is slow to anger has great understanding, but he who has a quick temper promotes folly.
    <sup>30</sup>&#8239;A tranquil heart is life to the body, but envy makes the bones rot.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>15:13</sup>&#8239;A glad heart makes a cheerful countenance, but a sorrowful heart breaks the spirit.
    <sup>15</sup>&#8239;All the days of the afflicted are bad, but a cheerful heart has a continual feast.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>16:14</sup>&#8239;A king&#x02BC;s wrath is a messenger of death, but a wise man appeases it.
    <sup>32</sup>&#8239;He who is slow to anger is better than the mighty, and he who rules his spirit, than he who captures a city.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>17:5</sup>&#8239;Whoever mocks the poor insults his maker, and he who rejoices at calamity will not go unpunished.
    <sup>22</sup>&#8239;A joyful heart is good medicine, but a broken spirit dries up the bones.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>18:14</sup>&#8239;A man&#x02BC;s spirit can endure sickness, but who can bear a broken spirit?
</p>

<p>
    <sup>19:3</sup>&#8239;A man&#x02BC;s foolishness ruins his way, yet his heart rages against <span class="small-caps">God</span>.
    <sup>11</sup>&#8239;Good sense makes a man slow to anger, and it is his glory to overlook an offense.
    <sup>19</sup>&#8239;A man of great anger will pay the penalty, for if you rescue him, you will have to do it again.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>20:1</sup>&#8239;Wine is a mocker, strong drink a brawler, and whoever is led astray by them is not wise.
    <sup>22</sup>&#8239;Don&#x02BC;t say, <q>I will repay evil</q>. Wait for <span class="small-caps">God</span>, and he will save you.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>29:11</sup>&#8239;A fool gives full vent to his anger, but a wise man holds it back.
    <sup>22</sup>&#8239;An angry man stirs up strife, and a hot-tempered man abounds in transgression.
</p>


<h2>And More</h2>
<p>
    <sup>10:22</sup>&#8239;The blessing of <span class="small-caps">God</span> enriches, and he adds no sorrow to it.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>11:14</sup>&#8239;Without guidance the people fall, but with many counselors there is safety.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>14:27</sup>&#8239;The fear of <span class="small-caps">God</span> is a fountain of life, turning one away from the snares of death.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>15:9</sup>&#8239;The way of the wicked is an abomination to <span class="small-caps">God</span>, but he loves him who pursues righteousness.
    <sup>22</sup>&#8239;Without counsel plans fail, but with many advisers they succeed.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>16:33</sup>&#8239;The lot is cast into the lap, but its every decision is from <span class="small-caps">God</span>.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>17:4</sup>&#8239;An evildoer listens to wicked lips, and a liar pays attention to a destructive tongue.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>20:18</sup>&#8239;Establish plans by counsel, and make war with wise guidance.
