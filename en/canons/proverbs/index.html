<p>
    <sup>3:1</sup>&#8239;My son, don&#x02BC;t for&shy;get my teach&shy;ing, but let your heart keep my com&shy;mand&shy;ments,
    <sup>2</sup>&#8239;for they will bring you man&shy;y days, years of life, and peace.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>3:3</sup>&#8239;Don&#x02BC;t let kind&shy;ness and truth leave you. Tie them a&shy;round your neck. Write them on the tab&shy;let of your heart.
    <sup>4</sup>&#8239;Then you will find fa&shy;vor and high re&shy;gard in the sight of God and man.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>3:5</sup>&#8239;Trust in <span class="small-caps">God</span> with all your heart, and don&#x02BC;t lean on your own un&shy;der&shy;stand&shy;ing.
    <sup>6</sup>&#8239;In all your ways ac&shy;knowl&shy;edge him, and he will make your paths straight.
    <sup>7</sup>&#8239;Don&#x02BC;t be wise in your own eyes. Fear <span class="small-caps">God</span>, and turn a&shy;way from e&shy;vil.
    <sup>8</sup>&#8239;It will be heal&shy;ing to your bod&shy;y, and re&shy;fresh&shy;ment to your bones.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>3:9</sup>&#8239;Hon&shy;or <span class="small-caps">God</span> with your wealth, and with the firstfruits of all your pro&shy;duce,
    <sup>10</sup>&#8239;then your barns will be filled with plen&shy;ty, and your vats will o&shy;ver&shy;flow with new wine.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>3:11</sup>&#8239;My son, don&#x02BC;t re&shy;ject the dis&shy;ci&shy;pline of <span class="small-caps">God</span> or loathe his re&shy;proof;
    <sup>12</sup>&#8239;for <span class="small-caps">God</span> re&shy;proves the one he loves, just as a fa&shy;ther re&shy;proves the son in whom he de&shy;lights.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>3:13</sup>&#8239;Hap&shy;py is the man who finds wis&shy;dom, and the man who gains un&shy;der&shy;stand&shy;ing.
    <sup>14</sup>&#8239;For she is more prof&shy;it&shy;a&shy;ble than sil&shy;ver, and her gain is bet&shy;ter than fi&shy;ne gold.
    <sup>15</sup>&#8239;She is more pre&shy;cious than jew&shy;els, and noth&shy;ing you de&shy;sire com&shy;pares with her.
    <sup>16</sup>&#8239;Long life is in her right hand. In her left hand are rich&shy;es and hon&shy;or.
    <sup>17</sup>&#8239;Her ways are pleas&shy;ant, and all her paths are peace&shy;ful.
    <sup>18</sup>&#8239;She is a tree of life to those who take hold of her. Those who hold her fast are hap&shy;py.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>3:19</sup>&#8239;<span class="small-caps">God</span> founded the earth by wis&shy;dom. He es&shy;tab&shy;lished the heav&shy;ens by un&shy;der&shy;stand&shy;ing.
    <sup>20</sup>&#8239;By his knowl&shy;edge the depths broke o&shy;pen, and the clouds drip with dew.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>3:21</sup>&#8239;My son, don&#x02BC;t lose sight of them. Keep sound wis&shy;dom and dis&shy;cre&shy;tion.
    <sup>22</sup>&#8239;Th&shy;ey will be life for your soul, and a&shy;dorn&shy;ment for your neck.
    <sup>23</sup>&#8239;Then you will walk on your way se&shy;cure&shy;ly, and your foot won&#x02BC;t stum&shy;ble.
    <sup>24</sup>&#8239;When you lie down, you won&#x02BC;t be a&shy;fraid. When you lie down, your sleep will be sweet.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>3:25</sup>&#8239;Don&#x02BC;t fear sud&shy;den dis&shy;as&shy;ter or the ru&shy;in of the wick&shy;ed when it co&shy;mes,
    <sup>26</sup>&#8239;for <span class="small-caps">God</span> will be your con&shy;fi&shy;dence, and will keep your foot from be&shy;ing caught.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>3:27</sup>&#8239;Don&#x02BC;t with&shy;hold good from those who de&shy;serve it, when it is in your pow&shy;er to do it.
    <sup>28</sup>&#8239;Don&#x02BC;t say to your neigh&shy;bor, <q>Go, and come back. I&#x02BC;ll give it to&shy;mor&shy;row,</q> when you have it with you.
    <sup>29</sup>&#8239;Don&#x02BC;t plan e&shy;vil a&shy;gainst your neigh&shy;bor, who lives trustingly be&shy;side you.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>3:30</sup>&#8239;Don&#x02BC;t con&shy;tend with a man with&shy;out cause, when he has done you no harm.
    <sup>31</sup>&#8239;Don&#x02BC;t en&shy;vy a vi&shy;o&shy;lent man or choose any of his ways,
    <sup>32</sup>&#8239;for the de&shy;vi&shy;ous are an a&shy;bom&shy;i&shy;na&shy;tion to <span class="small-caps">God</span>, but he is a friend to the up&shy;right.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>3:33</sup>&#8239;The curse of <span class="small-caps">God</span> is on the house of the wick&shy;ed, but he blesses the dwell&shy;ing of the right&shy;eous.
    <sup>34</sup>&#8239;He mocks the mock&shy;ers, but shows fa&shy;vor to the hum&shy;ble.
    <sup>35</sup>&#8239;The wise will in&shy;her&shy;it hon&shy;or, but fools get shame.
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>4:1</sup>&#8239;Lis&shy;ten, sons, to a fa&shy;ther&#x02BC;s in&shy;struc&shy;tion, and pay at&shy;ten&shy;tion so that you may gain un&shy;der&shy;stand&shy;ing.
    <sup>2</sup>&#8239;For I give you sound in&shy;struc&shy;tion. Don&#x02BC;t a&shy;ban&shy;don my teach&shy;ing.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>4:3</sup>&#8239;When I was a son to my fa&shy;ther, ten&shy;der and the on&shy;ly son in my moth&shy;er&#x02BC;s sight,
    <sup>4</sup>&#8239;he taught me, and sa&shy;id to me: <q>Let your heart hold on to my words. Keep my com&shy;mand&shy;ments and live.
    <sup>5</sup>&#8239;Get wis&shy;dom. Get un&shy;der&shy;stand&shy;ing. Don&#x02BC;t for&shy;get or turn a&shy;way from the words of my mouth.
    <sup>6</sup>&#8239;Don&#x02BC;t for&shy;sake her, and she will guard you. Love her, and she will watch o&shy;ver you.
    <sup>7</sup>&#8239;The be&shy;gin&shy;ning of wis&shy;dom is this: Get wis&shy;dom, and what&shy;ev&shy;er else you get, get un&shy;der&shy;stand&shy;ing.
    <sup>8</sup>&#8239;Prize her, and she will ex&shy;alt you. If you em&shy;brace her, she will hon&shy;or you.
    <sup>9</sup>&#8239;She will place on your head a gar&shy;land of grace. She will pre&shy;sent you with a crown of beau&shy;ty.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>4:10</sup>&#8239;Lis&shy;ten, my son, and ac&shy;cept my say&shy;ings, and the years of your life will be man&shy;y.
    <sup>11</sup>&#8239;I have taught you in the way of wis&shy;dom. I have led you in up&shy;right paths.
    <sup>12</sup>&#8239;When you walk, your steps won&#x02BC;t be hind&shy;ered. When you run, you won&#x02BC;t stum&shy;ble.
    <sup>13</sup>&#8239;Hold on to in&shy;struc&shy;tion. Don&#x02BC;t let go. Guard her, for she is your life.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>4:14</sup>&#8239;Don&#x02BC;t en&shy;ter the path of the wick&shy;ed, and don&#x02BC;t walk in the way of e&shy;vil men.
    <sup>15</sup>&#8239;A&shy;void it. Don&#x02BC;t trav&shy;el on it. Turn a&shy;way from it, and pas&shy;s on.
    <sup>16</sup>&#8239;For they can&shy;not sleep un&shy;less they do e&shy;vil. They are robbed of sleep un&shy;less they make some&shy;one stum&shy;ble.
    <sup>17</sup>&#8239;For they eat the bread of wick&shy;ed&shy;ness, and drink the wine of vi&shy;o&shy;lence.
    <sup>18</sup>&#8239;But the path of the right&shy;eous is like the light of dawn, which shines brighter and brighter un&shy;til mid&shy;day.
    <sup>19</sup>&#8239;The way of the wick&shy;ed is like dark&shy;ness. They don&#x02BC;t know what makes them stum&shy;ble.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>4:20</sup>&#8239;My son, pay at&shy;ten&shy;tion to my words. Lis&shy;ten care&shy;ful&shy;ly to my say&shy;ings.
    <sup>21</sup>&#8239;Don&#x02BC;t lose sight of them. Keep them with&shy;in your heart.
    <sup>22</sup>&#8239;For they are life to those who find them, and health to their whole bod&shy;y.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>4:23</sup>&#8239;Watch o&shy;ver your heart with all dil&shy;i&shy;gence, for the springs of life flow from it.
    <sup>24</sup>&#8239;Put a&shy;way from you de&shy;ceit&shy;ful speech, and put de&shy;vi&shy;ous talk far from you.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>4:25</sup>&#8239;Let your eyes look di&shy;rect&shy;ly a&shy;head and your gaze straight in front of you.
    <sup>26</sup>&#8239;Care&shy;ful&shy;ly con&shy;sid&shy;er the path of your feet, then all your ways will be sure.
    <sup>27</sup>&#8239;Don&#x02BC;t turn to the right or to the left. Keep your foot from e&shy;vil.
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>5:1</sup>&#8239;My son, pay at&shy;ten&shy;tion to my wis&shy;dom. Lis&shy;ten care&shy;ful&shy;ly to my un&shy;der&shy;stand&shy;ing,
    <sup>2</sup>&#8239;that you may main&shy;tain dis&shy;cre&shy;tion, and that your lips may guard knowl&shy;edge.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>5:3</sup>&#8239;The lips of a for&shy;bid&shy;den wom&shy;an drip hon&shy;ey, and her speech is smooth&shy;er than oil,
    <sup>4</sup>&#8239;but in the end she&#x02BC;s as bit&shy;ter as worm&shy;wood, and as sharp as a dou&shy;ble-edged sword.
    <sup>5</sup>&#8239;Her feet go down to death. Her steps lead straight to hell.
    <sup>6</sup>&#8239;She doesn&#x02BC;t pon&shy;der the path of life. Her ways are un&shy;sta&shy;ble, and she doesn&#x02BC;t know it.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>5:7</sup>&#8239;Now then, my sons, lis&shy;ten to me, and don&#x02BC;t de&shy;part from the words of my mouth.
    <sup>8</sup>&#8239;Keep your way far from her. Don&#x02BC;t go near the door of her house
    <sup>9</sup>&#8239;lest you give your vig&shy;or to oth&shy;ers and your years to some&shy;one cru&shy;el,
    <sup>10</sup>&#8239;lest strang&shy;ers feast on your wealth, your la&shy;bors en&shy;rich the house of a for&shy;eign&shy;er,
    <sup>11</sup>&#8239;and at the end of your life you groan when your flesh and bod&shy;y are con&shy;sumed.
    <sup>12</sup>&#8239;You will say, <q>How I hat&shy;ed dis&shy;ci&shy;pline! How my heart de&shy;spised re&shy;proof!
    <sup>13</sup>&#8239;I didn&#x02BC;t o&shy;bey my teach&shy;ers or lis&shy;ten to my in&shy;struc&shy;tors!
    <sup>14</sup>&#8239;I am al&shy;most in ut&shy;ter ru&shy;in in the midst of the as&shy;sem&shy;bly and con&shy;gre&shy;ga&shy;tion.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>5:15</sup>&#8239;Drink wa&shy;ter from your own cis&shy;tern, and fresh wa&shy;ter from your own well.
    <sup>16</sup>&#8239;Should your springs be scat&shy;tered a&shy;broad, streams of wa&shy;ter in the streets?
    <sup>17</sup>&#8239;Let them be yours a&shy;lone, and not for strang&shy;ers with you.
    <sup>18</sup>&#8239;Let your foun&shy;tain be bless&shy;ed, and re&shy;joice in the wife of your youth,
    <sup>19</sup>&#8239;as a lov&shy;ing deer and a grace&shy;ful doe. Let her breasts sat&shy;is&shy;fy you al&shy;ways, and be ex&shy;hil&shy;a&shy;rat&shy;ed al&shy;ways with her love.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>5:20</sup>&#8239;Why, my son, should you be ex&shy;hil&shy;a&shy;rat&shy;ed with a for&shy;bid&shy;den wom&shy;an, or em&shy;brace the bos&shy;om of a stran&shy;ger?
    <sup>21</sup>&#8239;For a man&#x02BC;s ways are be&shy;fore the eyes of <span class="small-caps">God</span>, and he con&shy;sid&shy;ers all his paths.
    <sup>22</sup>&#8239;The iniquities of the wick&shy;ed en&shy;trap him. He is held in the cords of his sin.
    <sup>23</sup>&#8239;He dies for lack of dis&shy;ci&shy;pline, and be&shy;cause of his great fol&shy;ly he will go a&shy;stray.
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>6:1</sup>&#8239;My son, if you have put up se&shy;cu&shy;ri&shy;ty for your neigh&shy;bor or have giv&shy;en a pledge for a stran&shy;ger,
    <sup>2</sup>&#8239;if you have been snared or caught with the words of your mouth,
    <sup>3</sup>&#8239;then do this, my son, and free your&shy;self. You have fall&shy;en in&shy;to your neigh&shy;bor&#x02BC;s hands. Go, hum&shy;ble your&shy;self, and plead with your neigh&shy;bor.
    <sup>4</sup>&#8239;Give your eyes no sleep and your eye&shy;lids no slum&shy;ber.
    <sup>5</sup>&#8239;Save your&shy;self like a ga&shy;zelle from the hunt&shy;er&#x02BC;s hand, and like a bird from the fowl&shy;er&#x02BC;s hand.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>6:6</sup>&#8239;Go to the ant, you i&shy;dler. Ob&shy;serve its ways, and be wise.
    <sup>7</sup>&#8239;With&shy;out chief, of&shy;fic&shy;er, or rul&shy;er,
    <sup>8</sup>&#8239;it pre&shy;pares its pro&shy;vi&shy;sions in sum&shy;mer, and gath&shy;ers its food dur&shy;ing har&shy;vest.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>6:9</sup>&#8239;How long will you lie down, you i&shy;dler? When will you get up from your sleep?
    <sup>10</sup>&#8239;A lit&shy;tle sleep, a lit&shy;tle slum&shy;ber, a lit&shy;tle folding of the hands to rest,
    <sup>11</sup>&#8239;and pov&shy;er&shy;ty will come up&shy;on you like a rob&shy;ber, and want like an armed man.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>6:12</sup>&#8239;A worth&shy;less per&shy;son, a wick&shy;ed man, goes a&shy;round speak&shy;ing per&shy;verse&shy;ly.
    <sup>14</sup>&#8239;With per&shy;ver&shy;si&shy;ty in his heart, he de&shy;vises e&shy;vil con&shy;tin&shy;u&shy;al&shy;ly, and sows dis&shy;cord.
    <sup>15</sup>&#8239;There&shy;fore ca&shy;lam&shy;i&shy;ty will strike him sud&shy;den&shy;ly. In&shy;stant&shy;ly he will be bro&shy;ken be&shy;yond heal&shy;ing.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>6:16</sup>&#8239;Sev&shy;en things are an a&shy;bom&shy;i&shy;na&shy;tion to <span class="small-caps">God</span>:
    <sup>17</sup>&#8239;hau&shy;gh&shy;ty eyes, a ly&shy;ing tongue, hands that shed in&shy;no&shy;cent blood,
    <sup>18</sup>&#8239;a heart that de&shy;vises wick&shy;ed plans, feet that run swift&shy;ly to e&shy;vil,
    <sup>19</sup>&#8239;a false wit&shy;ness who ut&shy;ters lies, and one who sows dis&shy;cord a&shy;mong broth&shy;ers.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>6:20</sup>&#8239;My son, keep your fa&shy;ther&#x02BC;s com&shy;mand, and don&#x02BC;t for&shy;sake your moth&shy;er&#x02BC;s teach&shy;ing.
    <sup>21</sup>&#8239;Al&shy;ways bind them on your heart. Tie them a&shy;round your neck.
    <sup>22</sup>&#8239;Wh&shy;en you walk, they will guide you. When you sleep, they will watch o&shy;ver you. When you wake up, they will talk to you.
    <sup>23</sup>&#8239;For this com&shy;mand is a lamp, this teach&shy;ing is a light, and cor&shy;rec&shy;tive dis&shy;ci&shy;pline is the way to life,
    <sup>24</sup>&#8239;keep&shy;ing you from the e&shy;vil wom&shy;an, from the flattering tongue of an a&shy;dul&shy;ter&shy;ess.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>6:25</sup>&#8239;Don&#x02BC;t de&shy;sire her beau&shy;ty in your heart or let her cap&shy;ti&shy;vate you with her eyes.
    <sup>26</sup>&#8239;For a pros&shy;ti&shy;tute&#x02BC;s fee is on&shy;ly a loaf of bread, but a mar&shy;ried wom&shy;an hunts down a pre&shy;cious life.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>6:27</sup>&#8239;Can a man em&shy;brace fire with&shy;out burn&shy;ing his clothes?
    <sup>28</sup>&#8239;Or can he walk on hot coals with&shy;out scorching his feet?
    <sup>29</sup>&#8239;So is he who goes in to his neigh&shy;bor&#x02BC;s wife. None who touches her will go un&shy;pun&shy;ished.
</p>

    <sup>22:9</sup>&#8239;He who is gen&shy;er&shy;ous will be bless&shy;ed, for he shares his bread with the poor.
    <sup>16</sup>&#8239;He who oppresses the poor to in&shy;crease his wealth, or who gives to the rich, will on&shy;ly come to pov&shy;er&shy;ty.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>25:21</sup>&#8239;If your en&shy;e&shy;my is hun&shy;gry, give him bread to eat, and if he is thirst&shy;y, give him wa&shy;ter to drink.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>27:7</sup>&#8239;He who is full loathes hon&shy;ey, but to the hun&shy;gry any bit&shy;ter thing is sweet.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>28:27</sup>&#8239;He who gives to the poor will nev&shy;er want, but he who hides his eyes will have man&shy;y curs&shy;es.
</p>


<h2 id="emotion">E&shy;mo&shy;tion</h2>
<p>
    <sup>12:25</sup>&#8239;Anx&shy;i&shy;e&shy;ty in a man&#x02BC;s heart weighs it down, but a good word makes it glad.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>13:12</sup>&#8239;Hope de&shy;ferred makes the heart sick, but de&shy;sire ful&shy;filled is a tree of life.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>14:13</sup>&#8239;E&shy;ven in laugh&shy;ter the heart may ache, and joy may end in grief.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>14:17</sup>&#8239;A man of quick tem&shy;per acts fool&shy;ish&shy;ly, and a man of e&shy;vil schemes is hat&shy;ed.
    <sup>29</sup>&#8239;He who is slow to an&shy;ger has great un&shy;der&shy;stand&shy;ing, but he who has a quick tem&shy;per pro&shy;motes fol&shy;ly.
    <sup>30</sup>&#8239;A tran&shy;quil heart is life to the bod&shy;y, but en&shy;vy makes the bones rot.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>15:13</sup>&#8239;A glad heart makes a cheer&shy;ful coun&shy;te&shy;nance, but a sorrowful heart breaks the spir&shy;it.
    <sup>15</sup>&#8239;All the days of the af&shy;flicted are bad, but a cheer&shy;ful heart has a con&shy;tin&shy;u&shy;al feast.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>16:14</sup>&#8239;A king&#x02BC;s wrath is a mes&shy;sen&shy;ger of death, but a wise man ap&shy;peases it.
    <sup>32</sup>&#8239;He who is slow to an&shy;ger is bet&shy;ter than the might&shy;y, and he who rules his spir&shy;it, than he who cap&shy;tures a cit&shy;y.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>17:5</sup>&#8239;Who&shy;ev&shy;er mocks the poor in&shy;sults his mak&shy;er, and he who re&shy;joices at ca&shy;lam&shy;i&shy;ty will not go un&shy;pun&shy;ished.
    <sup>22</sup>&#8239;A joy&shy;ful heart is good med&shy;i&shy;cine, but a bro&shy;ken spir&shy;it dries up the bones.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>18:14</sup>&#8239;A man&#x02BC;s spir&shy;it can en&shy;dure sick&shy;ness, but who can bear a bro&shy;ken spir&shy;it?
</p>

<p>
    <sup>19:3</sup>&#8239;A man&#x02BC;s fool&shy;ish&shy;ness ru&shy;ins his way, yet his heart rages a&shy;gainst <span class="small-caps">God</span>.
    <sup>11</sup>&#8239;Good sense makes a man slow to an&shy;ger, and it is his glo&shy;ry to o&shy;ver&shy;look an of&shy;fense.
    <sup>19</sup>&#8239;A man of great an&shy;ger will pay the pen&shy;al&shy;ty, for if you res&shy;cue him, you will have to do it a&shy;gain.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>20:1</sup>&#8239;Wine is a mocker, strong drink a brawl&shy;er, and who&shy;ev&shy;er is led a&shy;stray by them is not wise.
    <sup>22</sup>&#8239;Don&#x02BC;t say, <q>I will re&shy;pay e&shy;vil</q>. Wait for <span class="small-caps">God</span>, and he will save you.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>29:11</sup>&#8239;A fool gives full vent to his an&shy;ger, but a wise man holds it back.
    <sup>22</sup>&#8239;An an&shy;gry man stirs up strife, and a hot-tempered man a&shy;bounds in trans&shy;gres&shy;sion.
</p>


<h2 id="and-more">And More</h2>
<p>
    <sup>10:22</sup>&#8239;The bles&shy;sing of <span class="small-caps">God</span> enriches, and he adds no sor&shy;row to it.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>11:14</sup>&#8239;With&shy;out guid&shy;ance the peo&shy;ple fall, but with man&shy;y coun&shy;se&shy;lors there is safe&shy;ty.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>14:27</sup>&#8239;The fear of <span class="small-caps">God</span> is a foun&shy;tain of life, turn&shy;ing one a&shy;way from the snares of death.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>15:9</sup>&#8239;The way of the wick&shy;ed is an a&shy;bom&shy;i&shy;na&shy;tion to <span class="small-caps">God</span>, but he loves him who pur&shy;sues right&shy;eous&shy;ness.
    <sup>22</sup>&#8239;With&shy;out coun&shy;sel plans fail, but with man&shy;y ad&shy;vis&shy;ers they suc&shy;ceed.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>16:33</sup>&#8239;The lot is cast in&shy;to the lap, but its eve&shy;ry de&shy;ci&shy;sion is from <span class="small-caps">God</span>.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>17:4</sup>&#8239;An e&shy;vil&shy;do&shy;er lis&shy;tens to wick&shy;ed lips, and a li&shy;ar pays at&shy;ten&shy;tion to a de&shy;struc&shy;tive tongue.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>20:18</sup>&#8239;Es&shy;tab&shy;lish plans by coun&shy;sel, and make war with wise guid&shy;ance.
