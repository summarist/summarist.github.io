<h2>Pairs</h2>
<p>
    <sup>1</sup>&#8239;Our life is shaped by our mind: it is ruled by our mind, it is made by our mind. If one speaks or acts with an e&shy;vil mind, suf&shy;fer&shy;ing fol&shy;lows him, as the wheel fol&shy;lows the foot of the ox that draws the cart.
    <sup>2</sup>&#8239;Our life is shaped by our mind: it is ruled by our mind, it is made by our mind. If one speaks or acts with a pure mind, hap&shy;pi&shy;ness fol&shy;lows him, like a shad&shy;ow that nev&shy;er leaves him.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>3</sup>&#8239;<q>He in&shy;sulted me, hit me, de&shy;feated me, robbed me.</q> In those who har&shy;bor such thoughts, ha&shy;tred will nev&shy;er cease.
    <sup>4</sup>&#8239;<q>He in&shy;sulted me, hit me, de&shy;feated me, robbed me.</q> In those who do not har&shy;bor such thoughts, ha&shy;tred will cease.
    <sup>5</sup>&#8239;For ha&shy;tred nev&shy;er ceases by ha&shy;tred. Ha&shy;tred ceases by love. This is an e&shy;ter&shy;nal law.
    <sup>6</sup>&#8239;Some do not re&shy;al&shy;ize that we all must die, but those who do re&shy;al&shy;ize it cease their quar&shy;rels at once.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>7</sup>&#8239;Just as the wind throws down a weak tree, so will the tempter o&shy;ver&shy;throw him who fo&shy;cus&shy;es on&shy;ly on pleas&shy;ures, his senses un&shy;con&shy;trolled, im&shy;mo&shy;der&shy;ate in his food, i&shy;dle, and weak.
    <sup>8</sup>&#8239;Just as the wind can&shy;not throw down a rock&shy;y moun&shy;tain, so the tempter will not o&shy;ver&shy;throw him who does not fo&shy;cus on pleas&shy;ures, his senses well con&shy;trolled, mod&shy;er&shy;ate in his food, faith&shy;ful and strong.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>9</sup>&#8239;He who puts on the monk&#x02BC;s yel&shy;low robe with&shy;out hav&shy;ing cleansed him&shy;self from sin, who dis&shy;re&shy;gards self-control and truth, is un&shy;wor&shy;thy of the robe.
    <sup>10</sup>&#8239;But he who has cleansed him&shy;self from sin, is well grounded in vir&shy;tues, and re&shy;gards self-control and truth, is in&shy;deed wor&shy;thy of the robe.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>11</sup>&#8239;They who mis&shy;take the triv&shy;i&shy;al for the es&shy;sen&shy;tial, and the es&shy;sen&shy;tial for the triv&shy;i&shy;al, nev&shy;er ar&shy;rive at the es&shy;sen&shy;tial, but fol&shy;low vain de&shy;sires.
    <sup>12</sup>&#8239;They who know the es&shy;sen&shy;tial as es&shy;sen&shy;tial, and the triv&shy;i&shy;al as triv&shy;i&shy;al, ar&shy;rive at the es&shy;sen&shy;tial, and fol&shy;low true de&shy;sires.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>13</sup>&#8239;Just as rain seeps through a poor&shy;ly thatched house, pas&shy;sion seeps through an undeveloped mind.
    <sup>14</sup>&#8239;Just as rain can&shy;not seep through a well thatched house, pas&shy;sion can&shy;not seep through a well de&shy;vel&shy;oped mind.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>15</sup>&#8239;The e&shy;vil&shy;do&shy;er grieves in this world, and in the next. He grieves in both. He grieves and suf&shy;fers when he sees the e&shy;vil of his own work.
    <sup>16</sup>&#8239;The vir&shy;tu&shy;ous man de&shy;lights in this world, and in the next. He de&shy;lights in both. He de&shy;lights and re&shy;joices when he sees the pu&shy;ri&shy;ty of his own work.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>17</sup>&#8239;The e&shy;vil&shy;do&shy;er suf&shy;fers in this world, and in the next.  He suf&shy;fers in both. He suf&shy;fers when he thinks of the e&shy;vil he has done. He suf&shy;fers more when go&shy;ing to the next world.
    <sup>18</sup>&#8239;The vir&shy;tu&shy;ous man is hap&shy;py in this world, and in the next. He is hap&shy;py in both. He is hap&shy;py when he thinks of the good he has done. He is hap&shy;pi&shy;er still when go&shy;ing to the next world.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>19</sup>&#8239;The thought&shy;less man, if he re&shy;cites man&shy;y scrip&shy;tures, but does not do what they say, has no share in the bless&shy;ings of the ho&shy;ly life, but is like a cow&shy;herd counting the cows of oth&shy;ers.
    <sup>20</sup>&#8239;He who re&shy;cites on&shy;ly a few scrip&shy;tures, but does what they say, hav&shy;ing for&shy;sak&shy;en lust and ha&shy;tred and de&shy;lu&shy;sion, possesses true knowl&shy;edge and se&shy;ren&shy;i&shy;ty of mind, car&shy;ing for noth&shy;ing in this world or that to come, he shares in the bless&shy;ings of the ho&shy;ly life.
</p>


<h2>Vig&shy;i&shy;lance</h2>
<p>
    <sup>21</sup>&#8239;Vig&shy;i&shy;lance is the path to sal&shy;va&shy;tion. Care&shy;less&shy;ness is the path to death. Those who are vig&shy;i&shy;lant do not die. Those who are care&shy;less are as if dead al&shy;read&shy;y.
    <sup>22</sup>&#8239;The wise, hav&shy;ing un&shy;der&shy;stood this clear&shy;ly, de&shy;light in vig&shy;i&shy;lance, and re&shy;joice in the knowl&shy;edge of the no&shy;ble ones.
    <sup>23</sup>&#8239;These wise peo&shy;ple, meditative, stead&shy;fast&shy;ly per&shy;se&shy;ver&shy;ing, at&shy;tain to sal&shy;va&shy;tion, the highest hap&shy;pi&shy;ness.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>24</sup>&#8239;If a vig&shy;i&shy;lant per&shy;son is en&shy;er&shy;get&shy;ic, if he is mind&shy;ful, if his deeds are pure, if he acts with con&shy;sid&shy;er&shy;a&shy;tion, if he has self-control, and is right&shy;eous, then his glo&shy;ry will in&shy;crease.
    <sup>25</sup>&#8239;By ef&shy;fort, by vig&shy;i&shy;lance, by dis&shy;ci&shy;pline and self-control, the wise man may make for him&shy;self an is&shy;land which no flood can o&shy;ver&shy;whelm.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>26</sup>&#8239;The fool&shy;ish and ig&shy;no&shy;rant in&shy;dulge in care&shy;less&shy;ness. The wise man keeps vig&shy;i&shy;lance as his great&shy;est treas&shy;ure.
    <sup>27</sup>&#8239;Do not give way to care&shy;less&shy;ness or to the en&shy;joy&shy;ment of sen&shy;su&shy;al pleas&shy;ures.  He who is vig&shy;i&shy;lant and meditative, ob&shy;tains am&shy;ple joy.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>28</sup>&#8239;When the wise man drives a&shy;way care&shy;less&shy;ness by vig&shy;i&shy;lance, he climbs the tow&shy;er of wis&shy;dom and looks down up&shy;on the fools. With&shy;out suf&shy;fer&shy;ing, he looks at the suf&shy;fer&shy;ing crowd, as one that stands on a moun&shy;tain looks at them that stand on the ground be&shy;low.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>29</sup>&#8239;Vig&shy;i&shy;lant a&shy;mong the care&shy;less, a&shy;wake a&shy;mong the sleep&shy;ing, the wise man ad&shy;vanc&shy;es like a fast horse, leav&shy;ing the weak be&shy;hind.
    <sup>30</sup>&#8239;Vig&shy;i&shy;lance is al&shy;ways praised; care&shy;less&shy;ness is al&shy;ways de&shy;spised.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>31</sup>&#8239;The monk who de&shy;lights in vig&shy;i&shy;lance, who looks with fear at care&shy;less&shy;ness, moves a&shy;bout like fire, burn&shy;ing all fet&shy;ters, small and large.
    <sup>32</sup>&#8239;The monk who de&shy;lights in vig&shy;i&shy;lance, who looks with fear at care&shy;less&shy;ness, can&shy;not fall a&shy;way. He is close to sal&shy;va&shy;tion.
</p>


<h2>Mind</h2>
<p>
    <sup>33</sup>&#8239;Just as a fletch&shy;er straight&shy;ens his ar&shy;row, a wise man straight&shy;ens his trembling and un&shy;stead&shy;y mind, which is dif&shy;fi&shy;cult to guard, dif&shy;fi&shy;cult to re&shy;strain.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>34</sup>&#8239;Just as a fish quiv&shy;ers when tak&shy;en from its home in the wa&shy;ter and thrown on land, our mind trem&shy;bles all o&shy;ver to es&shy;cape the in&shy;flu&shy;ence of the tempter.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>35</sup>&#8239;It is good to tame the mind, which is dif&shy;fi&shy;cult to tame and flight&shy;y, rush&shy;ing wher&shy;ev&shy;er it wants. A tamed mind brings hap&shy;pi&shy;ness.
    <sup>36</sup>&#8239;Let the wise man guard his mind, for it is sub&shy;tle and e&shy;lu&shy;sive, and it rushes wher&shy;ev&shy;er it wants. A guard&shy;ed mind brings hap&shy;pi&shy;ness.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>37</sup>&#8239;The mind wan&shy;ders far, moves a&shy;bout a&shy;lone, is with&shy;out a bod&shy;y, and hides in the ca&shy;ve of the heart. Those who bri&shy;dle it are free from the bonds of the tempter.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>38</sup>&#8239;If a man&#x02BC;s mind is un&shy;stead&shy;y, if he does not know the true law, and if his faith is troubled, then his knowl&shy;edge will nev&shy;er be per&shy;fect.
    <sup>39</sup>&#8239;If a man&#x02BC;s mind is free from pas&shy;sion, if his mind is free from ill will, if he is un&shy;af&shy;fect&shy;ed by good and e&shy;vil, then there is dan&shy;ger for him.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>40</sup>&#8239;Know&shy;ing that this bod&shy;y is frag&shy;ile like a clay pot, and securing this mind like a for&shy;tress, at&shy;tack the tempter with the sword of knowl&shy;edge. Then guard what is won with&shy;out feel&shy;ing at&shy;tach&shy;ment to it.
    <sup>41</sup>&#8239;Soon, this bod&shy;y will lie on the ground, dis&shy;carded, with&shy;out con&shy;scious&shy;ness, like a use&shy;less log.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>42</sup>&#8239;What&shy;ev&shy;er an en&shy;e&shy;my might do to an en&shy;e&shy;my, or a foe to a foe, a wrong&shy;ly di&shy;rect&shy;ed mind can do to you e&shy;ven worse.
    <sup>43</sup>&#8239;What&shy;ev&shy;er a moth&shy;er, a fa&shy;ther, or an&shy;y oth&shy;er rel&shy;a&shy;tive might do for you, a well di&shy;rect&shy;ed mind can do for you e&shy;ven more.
</p>


<h2>Flowers</h2>
<p>
    <sup>44</sup>&#8239;Who will o&shy;ver&shy;come this earth, and the world of the dead, and the world of the gods? Who will choose the well taught path of vir&shy;tue, as an ex&shy;pert flo&shy;rist chooses the right flow&shy;er?
    <sup>45</sup>&#8239;A dis&shy;ci&shy;ple will o&shy;ver&shy;come this earth, and the world of the dead, and the world of the gods. A dis&shy;ci&shy;ple will choose the well taught path of vir&shy;tue, as an ex&shy;pert flo&shy;rist chooses the right flow&shy;er.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>46</sup>&#8239;Know&shy;ing that this bod&shy;y is like froth, and learn&shy;ing that it is in&shy;sub&shy;stan&shy;tial like a mi&shy;rage, you will re&shy;move the flow&shy;er-tipped ar&shy;rows of the tempter, and nev&shy;er see the king of death.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>47</sup>&#8239;As a flood sweeps a&shy;way a sleep&shy;ing vil&shy;lage, so death sweeps a&shy;way a man who is im&shy;mersed in gath&shy;er&shy;ing flow&shy;ers, his mind dis&shy;tract&shy;ed.
    <sup>48</sup>&#8239;Death sub&shy;dues a man who is im&shy;mersed in gath&shy;er&shy;ing flow&shy;ers, his mind dis&shy;tract&shy;ed, be&shy;fore he is sa&shy;ti&shy;at&shy;ed in his pleas&shy;ures.
    <sup>49</sup>&#8239;As a bee col&shy;lects nec&shy;tar and de&shy;parts with&shy;out dam&shy;ag&shy;ing the flow&shy;er or its col&shy;or or its scent, so should a sage col&shy;lect alms in a vil&shy;lage.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>50</sup>&#8239;Do not no&shy;tice the faults of oth&shy;ers, their sins of com&shy;mis&shy;sion or o&shy;mis&shy;sion, but no&shy;tice your own mis&shy;con&shy;duct and neg&shy;li&shy;gence.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>51</sup>&#8239;Like a beau&shy;ti&shy;ful flow&shy;er, full of col&shy;or but with&shy;out scent, are fair but fruit&shy;less words of him who does not prac&shy;tice them.
    <sup>52</sup>&#8239;But, like a beau&shy;ti&shy;ful flow&shy;er, full of col&shy;or and full of scent, are fair and fruit&shy;ful words of him who prac&shy;tices them.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>53</sup>&#8239;Just as man&shy;y wreaths can be made from a heap of flow&shy;ers, so can man&shy;y good things be done by a mor&shy;tal.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>54</sup>&#8239;The scent of flow&shy;ers does not trav&shy;el a&shy;gainst the wind, not e&shy;ven that of san&shy;dal&shy;wood, tagara or jas&shy;mine; but the rep&shy;u&shy;ta&shy;tion of the vir&shy;tu&shy;ous does trav&shy;el a&shy;gainst the wind. The rep&shy;u&shy;ta&shy;tion of the vir&shy;tu&shy;ous per&shy;vades eve&shy;ry place.
    <sup>55</sup>&#8239;A&shy;mong the scent of san&shy;dal&shy;wood, tagara, lo&shy;tus, and jas&shy;mine, the scent of vir&shy;tue is un&shy;sur&shy;passed.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>56</sup>&#8239;The scent that co&shy;mes from tagara and san&shy;dal&shy;wood is faint. The scent of the vir&shy;tu&shy;ous is best, it rises up to the gods.
    <sup>57</sup>&#8239;The tempter nev&shy;er finds the path of the vir&shy;tu&shy;ous, who lives with vig&shy;i&shy;lance, and is freed through per&shy;fect knowl&shy;edge.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>58</sup>&#8239;On a gar&shy;bage heap by the roadside, a lo&shy;tus grows full of sweet per&shy;fume and de&shy;light.
    <sup>59</sup>&#8239;Like&shy;wise, on a gar&shy;bage heap of blind mor&shy;tals, a true dis&shy;ci&shy;ple of the Bud&shy;dha shines forth in wis&shy;dom.
</p>


<h2>The Fool</h2>
<p>
    <sup>60</sup>&#8239;The night is long to the sleep&shy;less; a mile is long to the tired; life is long to the fool&shy;ish who do not know the true law.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>61</sup>&#8239;If a trav&shy;el&shy;er does not meet a com&shy;pan&shy;ion who is his bet&shy;ter, or his e&shy;qual, let him firm&shy;ly keep to his sol&shy;i&shy;tar&shy;y jour&shy;ney. There is no com&shy;pan&shy;ion&shy;ship with a fool.
    <sup>62</sup>&#8239;He worries, <q>I have sons, and I have wealth,</q> but he him&shy;self is not his own, how much less sons and wealth?
</p>

<p>
    <sup>63</sup>&#8239;A fool who knows his own fool&shy;ish&shy;ness, is wise to that ex&shy;tent. But a fool who thinks he is wise, is a fool in&shy;deed.
    <sup>64</sup>&#8239;E&shy;ven if a fool as&shy;so&shy;ci&shy;ates with a wise man all his life, he will per&shy;ceive the truth no more than a spoon per&shy;ceives the fla&shy;vor of the soup.
    <sup>65</sup>&#8239;If an in&shy;tel&shy;li&shy;gent man as&shy;so&shy;ci&shy;ates with a wise man for on&shy;ly one mi&shy;nute, he will soon per&shy;ceive the truth as the tongue per&shy;ceives the taste of soup.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>66</sup>&#8239;Fools of lit&shy;tle un&shy;der&shy;stand&shy;ing are their own enemies, for they do e&shy;vil deeds that bear bit&shy;ter fruit.
    <sup>67</sup>&#8239;That deed is poor&shy;ly done if a man must re&shy;pent af&shy;ter&shy;ward, and its re&shy;ward is cry&shy;ing and a tear&shy;ful face.
    <sup>68</sup>&#8239;That deed is well done if a man does not re&shy;pent af&shy;ter&shy;ward, and its re&shy;ward is de&shy;light and hap&shy;pi&shy;ness.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>69</sup>&#8239;As long as an e&shy;vil deed does not bear fruit, the fool thinks it is like hon&shy;ey. But when it rip&shy;ens, then the fool suf&shy;fers grief.
    <sup>70</sup>&#8239;E&shy;ven if a fool, month af&shy;ter month, eats his food like an as&shy;cet&shy;ic with the tip of a blade of grass, he is not worth e&shy;ven one six&shy;teenth of those who have un&shy;der&shy;stood the truth.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>71</sup>&#8239;An e&shy;vil deed, like fresh&shy;ly drawn milk, does not sour im&shy;me&shy;di&shy;ate&shy;ly; it fol&shy;lows the fool, smoldering, like fire cov&shy;ered by ash&shy;es.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>73</sup>&#8239;The fool wishes for a false rep&shy;u&shy;ta&shy;tion, for prec&shy;e&shy;dence a&shy;mong monks, for au&shy;thor&shy;i&shy;ty in the monasteries, for hon&shy;or a&shy;mong oth&shy;er peo&shy;ple.
    <sup>74</sup>&#8239;<q>May both laymen and monks think that I did it. Let them o&shy;bey me in eve&shy;ry&shy;thing, great and small.</q>  Such is the mind of the fool, and thus his de&shy;sire and pride in&shy;crease.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>75</sup>&#8239;One road leads to wealth, an&shy;oth&shy;er road leads to sal&shy;va&shy;tion. If the monk, a dis&shy;ci&shy;ple of Bud&shy;dha, has learn&shy;ed this, he will not yearn for hon&shy;or, he will strive for sep&shy;a&shy;ra&shy;tion from the world.
</p>


<h2>The Wise</h2>
<p>
    <sup>76</sup>&#8239;If you find a wise man who points out faults, and who re&shy;proves, fol&shy;low that wise man as one would fol&shy;low a guide to hid&shy;den treas&shy;ure.  It will be bet&shy;ter, not worse, for those who fol&shy;low him.
    <sup>77</sup>&#8239;Let him ad&shy;mon&shy;ish, let him teach, let him re&shy;strain you from what is im&shy;prop&shy;er. The good will love him. The bad will hate him.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>78</sup>&#8239;Do not have e&shy;vil&shy;do&shy;ers as com&shy;pan&shy;ions, do not have vile peo&shy;ple as friends. Have vir&shy;tu&shy;ous peo&shy;ple as com&shy;pan&shy;ions, have the best as friends.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>79</sup>&#8239;He who drinks in the law lives hap&shy;pi&shy;ly with a se&shy;rene mind. The wise man re&shy;joices al&shy;ways in the law, as preached by the no&shy;ble ones.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>80</sup>&#8239;Irrigators guide the wa&shy;ter. Fletchers straight&shy;en the ar&shy;row. Carpenters shape the wood. The wise con&shy;trol them&shy;selves.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>81</sup>&#8239;Just as a sol&shy;id rock is not shak&shy;en by the wind, the wise do not fal&shy;ter a&shy;midst blame or praise.
    <sup>82</sup>&#8239;Af&shy;ter they have lis&shy;tened to the law, the wise be&shy;come se&shy;rene, like a deep, smooth, and still lake.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>83</sup>&#8239;The good keep walk&shy;ing what&shy;ev&shy;er hap&shy;pens. The good do not prat&shy;tle, long&shy;ing for pleas&shy;ure. Wheth&shy;er tou&shy;ched by hap&shy;pi&shy;ness or sor&shy;row, the wise nev&shy;er ap&shy;pear e&shy;lat&shy;ed or de&shy;pressed.
    <sup>84</sup>&#8239;A man is good, wise, and vir&shy;tu&shy;ous if he does no wrong for his own sa&shy;ke or for the sa&shy;ke of oth&shy;ers, if he wishes nei&shy;ther for wealth, a son, or a king&shy;dom, and if he does not wish for suc&shy;cess by un&shy;fair means.

<h2>The Saint</h2>
<p>
    <sup>90</sup>&#8239;There is no suf&shy;fer&shy;ing for him who has fin&shy;ished his jour&shy;ney, and is with&shy;out sor&shy;row, and is free on all sides, and has thrown off all fet&shy;ters.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>91</sup>&#8239;The mind&shy;ful strive dil&shy;i&shy;gent&shy;ly.  They are not at&shy;tached to an&shy;y home. Like swans who leave a lake, they leave their house and home.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>92</sup>&#8239;Like birds in the air, the path of the saint is hard to trace. They have no rich&shy;es, are wise re&shy;gard&shy;ing food, and their ob&shy;jec&shy;tive is emp&shy;ti&shy;ness and free&shy;dom.
    <sup>93</sup>&#8239;Like birds in the air, his path is hard to trace. He whose ap&shy;pe&shy;tites are stilled, who is not at&shy;tached to food, whose ob&shy;jec&shy;tive is emp&shy;ti&shy;ness and free&shy;dom.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>94</sup>&#8239;E&shy;ven the gods a&shy;dore him whose senses have been sub&shy;dued, like hors&shy;es well trained by a char&shy;i&shy;ot&shy;eer, who is free from pride, and free from ap&shy;pe&shy;tites.
    <sup>95</sup>&#8239;Like the earth, he is not pro&shy;voked. He is firm like a pil&shy;lar.  He is like a pure lake with&shy;out mud. No new births are in store for him.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>96</sup>&#8239;His mind is calm, and calm are his words and deeds. By true knowl&shy;edge, he has ob&shy;tained free&shy;dom, and thus be&shy;come tran&shy;quil.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>98</sup>&#8239;In a vil&shy;lage or in a for&shy;est, in a val&shy;ley or on a hill, wher&shy;ev&shy;er saints dwell, that place is de&shy;light&shy;ful.
    <sup>99</sup>&#8239;De&shy;light&shy;ful are the for&shy;ests in which the crowds find no pleas&shy;ure. Those with&shy;out pas&shy;sion will find de&shy;light there, for they do not seek pleas&shy;ure.

<p>
    <sup>106</sup>&#8239;A man could sac&shy;ri&shy;fice by the thou&shy;sands for month af&shy;ter month for a hun&shy;dred years, or he could pay hom&shy;age for one mo&shy;ment to a man liv&shy;ing in wis&shy;dom. Bet&shy;ter is that hom&shy;age than sac&shy;ri&shy;fices for a cen&shy;tu&shy;ry.

<h2>E&shy;vil</h2>
<p>

</p>

<p>
    <sup>117</sup>&#8239;If a man does what is e&shy;vil, let him not do it a&shy;gain and a&shy;gain. Let him not de&shy;light in it, for ac&shy;cu&shy;mu&shy;lat&shy;ing e&shy;vil brings pain.

<p>
    <sup>121</sup>&#8239;Let no man think light&shy;ly of e&shy;vil, say&shy;ing in his heart, <q>It will not a&shy;mount to much.</q>  As a wa&shy;ter pot is filled by the fall&shy;ing of wa&shy;ter drops, so the fool be&shy;comes full of e&shy;vil, e&shy;ven if he gath&shy;ers it lit&shy;tle by lit&shy;tle.

</p>

<p>
    <sup>125</sup>&#8239;If a man of&shy;fends a harm&shy;less, pure, and in&shy;no&shy;cent per&shy;son, the e&shy;vil falls back up&shy;on that fool, like dust thrown a&shy;gainst the wind.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>126</sup>&#8239;Some are born in the womb.  Evildoers go to hell.  The right&shy;eous go to heav&shy;en.  Those with&shy;out an&shy;y world&shy;ly de&shy;sires at&shy;tain sal&shy;va&shy;tion.

<p>
    <sup>129</sup>&#8239;Eve&shy;ry&shy;one trem&shy;bles at pun&shy;ish&shy;ment, eve&shy;ry&shy;one fears death.  Put&shy;ting your&shy;self in his place, do not kill or cause oth&shy;ers to kill.

</p>

<p>
    <sup>133</sup>&#8239;Speak harsh&shy;ly to no one, or those who are spo&shy;ken to will an&shy;swer you in the same way. Con&shy;ten&shy;tious speech hurts, and re&shy;tal&shy;i&shy;a&shy;tion will come to you.
    <sup>134</sup>&#8239;If your mind is still, like a bro&shy;ken gong, you have at&shy;tained sal&shy;va&shy;tion, for there&#x02BC;s no con&shy;ten&shy;tion in you.

<p>
    <sup>137</sup>&#8239;He who in&shy;flicts pain on the in&shy;no&shy;cent and un&shy;armed, will soon suf&shy;fer in one of these ten ways:

<p>
    <sup>143</sup>&#8239;Who in this world is so re&shy;strained by con&shy;science that he needs no re&shy;proof, as a fi&shy;ne horse needs no whip?
    <sup>144</sup>&#8239;Like a fi&shy;ne horse when tou&shy;ched by the whip, be ac&shy;tive and live&shy;ly. By faith, by vir&shy;tue, by ef&shy;fort, by med&shy;i&shy;ta&shy;tion, by dis&shy;cern&shy;ing the truth, by per&shy;fect knowl&shy;edge and con&shy;duct, by mind&shy;ful&shy;ness, you will leave this pain be&shy;hind.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>145</sup>&#8239;Irrigators guide the wa&shy;ter.  Fletchers straight&shy;en the ar&shy;row. Carpenters shape the wood.  Good peo&shy;ple fash&shy;ion them&shy;selves.

<h2>Old Age</h2>
<p>
    <sup>146</sup>&#8239;Why is there laugh&shy;ter and joy when this world is al&shy;ways burn&shy;ing? Surrounded by dark&shy;ness, don&#x02BC;t you look for a light?
</p>

<p>
    <sup>147</sup>&#8239;Look at this bod&shy;y &mdash; a paint&shy;ed im&shy;age, cov&shy;ered with festering wounds, sick&shy;ly, full of man&shy;y thoughts &mdash; nei&shy;ther last&shy;ing nor sta&shy;ble.
    <sup>148</sup>&#8239;This bod&shy;y is worn out, full of sick&shy;ness, and frail.  This heap of cor&shy;rup&shy;tion breaks to pieces, for life in&shy;deed ends with death.
    <sup>149</sup>&#8239;These white bones are like gourds thrown a&shy;way in the au&shy;tumn. What pleas&shy;ure is there in see&shy;ing them?
</p>

<p>
    <sup>150</sup>&#8239;A cit&shy;y made of bones is cov&shy;ered with flesh and blood.  Liv&shy;ing in it are old age and death, pride and de&shy;ceit.
    <sup>151</sup>&#8239;The beau&shy;ti&shy;ful char&shy;i&shy;ots of kings get worn out and so does the bod&shy;y.  But the vir&shy;tue of good peo&shy;ple does not age: thus do the good say a&shy;mong them&shy;selves.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>152</sup>&#8239;A man who has learn&shy;ed lit&shy;tle grows old like an ox.  His bod&shy;y grows, but his wis&shy;dom does not.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>153</sup>&#8239;I roamed through man&shy;y births, with&shy;out re&shy;ward and with&shy;out rest, looking for the build&shy;er of this house.  Pain&shy;ful is birth a&shy;gain and a&shy;gain.
    <sup>154</sup>&#8239;But now, build&shy;er of this house, I have seen you.  You will not build this house a&shy;gain.  All your raft&shy;ers are bro&shy;ken, your ridge pole is dismantled.  My mind has at&shy;tained the ex&shy;tinc&shy;tion of all de&shy;sires.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>155</sup>&#8239;Those who, in their youth, have not lived the ho&shy;ly life nor gained wealth, per&shy;ish like old her&shy;ons in a lake with&shy;out fish.
    <sup>156</sup>&#8239;Those who, in their youth, have not lived the ho&shy;ly life nor gained wealth, lie sighing o&shy;ver the past like ar&shy;rows misfired from a bow.
</p>


<h2>Self</h2>
<p>
    <sup>157</sup>&#8239;If a man holds him&shy;self dear, let him watch him&shy;self care&shy;ful&shy;ly. Let a wise man keep vig&shy;il dur&shy;ing one of the three watches of the night.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>158</sup>&#8239;Let each man first di&shy;rect him&shy;self to what is prop&shy;er, then let him teach oth&shy;ers.  Thus a wise man will not be re&shy;proached.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>159</sup>&#8239;If a man makes him&shy;self as he teaches oth&shy;ers to be, then, be&shy;ing him&shy;self well tamed, he may tame oth&shy;ers.  One&#x02BC;s self is in&shy;deed dif&shy;fi&shy;cult to tame.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>160</sup>&#8239;A man is tru&shy;ly his own pro&shy;tec&shy;tor.  Who else could be the pro&shy;tec&shy;tor?  With self well con&shy;trolled, one finds a pro&shy;tec&shy;tor such as few can find.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>161</sup>&#8239;The e&shy;vil a fool&shy;ish man does by him&shy;self, self-born, self-created, grinds him down, as a di&shy;a&shy;mond breaks a hard gem.
    <sup>162</sup>&#8239;When o&shy;ver&shy;spread with great wick&shy;ed&shy;ness, like a tree cov&shy;ered by vines, a man brings him&shy;self down to where his en&shy;e&shy;my wishes.
    <sup>163</sup>&#8239;E&shy;vil deeds, which harm our&shy;selves, are eas&shy;y to do.  Good and ben&shy;e&shy;fi&shy;cial deeds are ver&shy;y dif&shy;fi&shy;cult to do.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>164</sup>&#8239;The fool who scorns the teach&shy;ings of the wise, of the no&shy;ble, of the right&shy;eous, and fol&shy;lows false doc&shy;trine, is like the bam&shy;boo that dies af&shy;ter bear&shy;ing fruit.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>165</sup>&#8239;E&shy;vil is done by one&shy;self, by one&shy;self one is de&shy;filed.  E&shy;vil is left un&shy;done by one&shy;self, by one&shy;self is one pu&shy;ri&shy;fied.  Pu&shy;ri&shy;ty and im&shy;pu&shy;ri&shy;ty are one&#x02BC;s own do&shy;ing.  No one can pu&shy;ri&shy;fy an&shy;oth&shy;er.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>166</sup>&#8239;Let no man sac&shy;ri&shy;fice his own wel&shy;fare for that of an&shy;oth&shy;er, how&shy;ev&shy;er great.  Let a man, af&shy;ter dis&shy;cern&shy;ing his own wel&shy;fare, be al&shy;ways at&shy;ten&shy;tive to it.

<p>
    <sup>168</sup>&#8239;Wake up!  Do not be i&shy;dle.  Live a vir&shy;tu&shy;ous life.  The vir&shy;tu&shy;ous sleeps with ease in this world and the next.
    <sup>169</sup>&#8239;Live a vir&shy;tu&shy;ous life.  Do not live a life of sin. The vir&shy;tu&shy;ous sleeps with ease in this world and the next.

<p>
    <sup>170</sup>&#8239;The king of death does not see him who looks up&shy;on the world as a bub&shy;ble, as a mi&shy;rage.
    <sup>171</sup>&#8239;Come look at this world, dec&shy;o&shy;rat&shy;ed like a roy&shy;al char&shy;i&shy;ot.  Fools are im&shy;mersed in it, but the wise do not cling to it.

    <sup>174</sup>&#8239;In this dark world, on&shy;ly a few can see.  On&shy;ly a few, like birds es&shy;cap&shy;ing from the net, go to heav&shy;en.
    <sup>175</sup>&#8239;Swans fly on the path of the sun, through the air by their won&shy;der&shy;ful pow&shy;er.  The wise flee from the world af&shy;ter defeating the tempter and his armies.

<p>
    <sup>176</sup>&#8239;A man who transgresses the one law, speaks lies, and scoffs at the world be&shy;yond, is ca&shy;pa&shy;ble of an&shy;y e&shy;vil.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>177</sup>&#8239;Misers do not go to the world of the gods; nei&shy;ther do fools praise gen&shy;er&shy;os&shy;i&shy;ty.  A wise man re&shy;joices in gen&shy;er&shy;os&shy;i&shy;ty, and through it be&shy;comes bless&shy;ed in the world be&shy;yond.

    <sup>182</sup>&#8239;It is dif&shy;fi&shy;cult to ob&shy;tain a hu&shy;man birth, dif&shy;fi&shy;cult is the life of mor&shy;tals.  It is dif&shy;fi&shy;cult to ob&shy;tain the chance to hear the true law, dif&shy;fi&shy;cult is the birth of the a&shy;wak&shy;ened.

    <sup>183</sup>&#8239;To a&shy;void all e&shy;vil, to cul&shy;ti&shy;vate good, and to pu&shy;ri&shy;fy one&#x02BC;s mind, that is the teach&shy;ing of the a&shy;wak&shy;ened.
    <sup>184</sup>&#8239;Pa&shy;tient en&shy;dur&shy;ance is the highest aus&shy;ter&shy;i&shy;ty. <q>Sal&shy;va&shy;tion is su&shy;preme</q>, say the a&shy;wak&shy;ened.  He is no monk who in&shy;jures oth&shy;ers. He is no as&shy;cet&shy;ic who in&shy;sults oth&shy;ers.
    <sup>185</sup>&#8239;Not to re&shy;vile, not to in&shy;jure, to live re&shy;strained un&shy;der the law, to be mod&shy;er&shy;ate in food, to live in sol&shy;i&shy;tude, and to dwell on the highest thoughts: this is the teach&shy;ing of the a&shy;wak&shy;ened.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>186</sup>&#8239;There is no way to sat&shy;is&shy;fy lusts, e&shy;ven with a show&shy;er of gold coins.  He is wise who knows that lusts give lit&shy;tle sat&shy;is&shy;fac&shy;tion and much pain.
    <sup>187</sup>&#8239;E&shy;ven in heav&shy;en&shy;ly pleas&shy;ures the wise finds no de&shy;light.  The dis&shy;ci&shy;ple who is ful&shy;ly a&shy;wak&shy;ened de&shy;lights on&shy;ly in the de&shy;struc&shy;tion of crav&shy;ing.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>188</sup>&#8239;When threat&shy;ened with dan&shy;ger, men go to man&shy;y a ref&shy;uge: to moun&shy;tains and for&shy;ests, to groves and shrines.
    <sup>189</sup>&#8239;But that is not a se&shy;cure ref&shy;uge, that is not the best ref&shy;uge.  A man is not de&shy;liv&shy;ered from all pain af&shy;ter go&shy;ing to that ref&shy;uge.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>190</sup>&#8239;He who takes ref&shy;uge with the law, the a&shy;wak&shy;ened, and their or&shy;der, sees with clear un&shy;der&shy;stand&shy;ing the four ho&shy;ly truths:
    <sup>191</sup>&#8239;pain, the cause of pain, the de&shy;struc&shy;tion of pain, and the ho&shy;ly eight&shy;fold path that leads to the quieting of pain;
    <sup>192</sup>&#8239;That is a se&shy;cure ref&shy;uge, that is the best ref&shy;uge.  Af&shy;ter go&shy;ing to that ref&shy;uge, a man is de&shy;liv&shy;ered from all pain.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>193</sup>&#8239;An a&shy;wak&shy;ened man is hard to find.  He is not born eve&shy;ry&shy;where. Wher&shy;ev&shy;er such a wise man is born, that clan pros&shy;pers.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>194</sup>&#8239;Bless&shy;ed is the arising of a&shy;wak&shy;ened ones, bless&shy;ed is the teach&shy;ing of the true law, bless&shy;ed is har&shy;mo&shy;ny in the or&shy;der, bless&shy;ed is the de&shy;vo&shy;tion of those who are at peace.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>195</sup>&#8239;He who re&shy;veres those who de&shy;serve rev&shy;er&shy;ence &mdash; the a&shy;wak&shy;ened ones or their dis&shy;ci&shy;ples, who have o&shy;ver&shy;come all ob&shy;sta&shy;cles, sor&shy;row, and la&shy;men&shy;ta&shy;tion,
    <sup>196</sup>&#8239;who found de&shy;liv&shy;er&shy;ance and know no fear &mdash; his mer&shy;it can nev&shy;er be meas&shy;ured.
</p>


<h2>Hap&shy;pi&shy;ness</h2>
<p>
    <sup>197</sup>&#8239;We live hap&shy;pi&shy;ly, not hat&shy;ing those who hate us.  When a&shy;mong men who hate us, we dwell with&shy;out ha&shy;tred.
    <sup>198</sup>&#8239;We live hap&shy;pi&shy;ly, with&shy;out ill&shy;ness a&shy;mong the ill.  When a&shy;mong men who are ill, we dwell with&shy;out ill&shy;ness.
    <sup>199</sup>&#8239;We live hap&shy;pi&shy;ly, with&shy;out greed a&shy;mong the greed&shy;y.  When a&shy;mong men who are greed&shy;y, we dwell with&shy;out greed.
    <sup>200</sup>&#8239;We live hap&shy;pi&shy;ly, we who own noth&shy;ing.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>201</sup>&#8239;Vic&shy;to&shy;ry breeds ha&shy;tred, for the con&shy;quered live in pain.  The con&shy;tent&shy;ed is hap&shy;py, hav&shy;ing giv&shy;en up both vic&shy;to&shy;ry and de&shy;feat.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>202</sup>&#8239;There is no fire like lust, no loss like ha&shy;tred, no pain like this ex&shy;ist&shy;ence, and no hap&shy;pi&shy;ness higher than peace.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>203</sup>&#8239;Hun&shy;ger is the worst dis&shy;ease, this ex&shy;ist&shy;ence the great&shy;est pain. If one tru&shy;ly knows this, he re&shy;al&shy;izes sal&shy;va&shy;tion, the highest hap&shy;pi&shy;ness.
    <sup>204</sup>&#8239;Health is the great&shy;est gift, con&shy;tent&shy;ment the great&shy;est wealth. Trust is the best kins&shy;man, sal&shy;va&shy;tion the highest hap&shy;pi&shy;ness.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>205</sup>&#8239;He who has sa&shy;vored the taste of sol&shy;i&shy;tude and tran&shy;quil&shy;i&shy;ty is free from fear and e&shy;vil, re&shy;freshed with the nour&shy;ish&shy;ment of the law.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>206</sup>&#8239;The sight of no&shy;ble ones is good.  To live with them is al&shy;ways hap&shy;pi&shy;ness.  If a man does not see fools, he will be tru&shy;ly hap&shy;py.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>207</sup>&#8239;He who walks with fools suf&shy;fers for a long time.  Com&shy;pa&shy;ny with fools, as with an en&shy;e&shy;my, is al&shy;ways pain&shy;ful.  Com&shy;pa&shy;ny with the wise is a pleas&shy;ure, like re&shy;un&shy;ion with fam&shy;i&shy;ly.
    <sup>208</sup>&#8239;There&shy;fore, fol&shy;low the wise, the in&shy;tel&shy;li&shy;gent, the learn&shy;ed, the stead&shy;fast, the du&shy;ti&shy;ful, the no&shy;ble.  Fol&shy;low a good and dis&shy;cern&shy;ing man, as the moon fol&shy;lows the path of the stars.
</p>


<h2>Pleas&shy;ure</h2>
<p>
    <sup>209</sup>&#8239;He who gives him&shy;self to van&shy;i&shy;ty, in&shy;stead of to med&shy;i&shy;ta&shy;tion, who for&shy;gets the goal and grasps at pleas&shy;ure, will come to en&shy;vy him who has ex&shy;erted him&shy;self.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>210</sup>&#8239;Don&#x02BC;t seek for what is pleas&shy;ant or un&shy;pleas&shy;ant, for it is pain not to see the pleas&shy;ant, and it is pain to see what is un&shy;pleas&shy;ant.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>211</sup>&#8239;There&shy;fore, let no man hold an&shy;y&shy;thing dear, for loss of the dear is pain&shy;ful.  Those who hold noth&shy;ing dear and hate noth&shy;ing have no fet&shy;ters.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>212</sup>&#8239;From pleas&shy;ure co&shy;mes grief, from pleas&shy;ure co&shy;mes fear.  He who is free from pleas&shy;ure knows nei&shy;ther grief nor fear.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>213</sup>&#8239;From af&shy;fec&shy;tion co&shy;mes grief, from af&shy;fec&shy;tion co&shy;mes fear.  He who is free from af&shy;fec&shy;tion knows nei&shy;ther grief nor fear.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>214</sup>&#8239;From at&shy;tach&shy;ment co&shy;mes grief, from at&shy;tach&shy;ment co&shy;mes fear.  He who is free from at&shy;tach&shy;ment knows nei&shy;ther grief nor fear.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>215</sup>&#8239;From lust co&shy;mes grief, from lust co&shy;mes fear.  He who is free from lust knows nei&shy;ther grief nor fear.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>216</sup>&#8239;From crav&shy;ing co&shy;mes grief, from crav&shy;ing co&shy;mes fear.  He who is free from crav&shy;ing knows nei&shy;ther grief nor fear.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>217</sup>&#8239;He who has vir&shy;tue and in&shy;sight, who is just, who speaks the truth, and does his own busi&shy;ness, him the world holds dear.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>218</sup>&#8239;He who is in&shy;tent up&shy;on sal&shy;va&shy;tion, who is sat&shy;is&shy;fied in his mind, and who is not at&shy;tached to pleas&shy;ure, is called <q>carried up&shy;stream</q>.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>219</sup>&#8239;Fam&shy;i&shy;ly, friends, and well-wishers wel&shy;come a man, long ab&shy;sent, who re&shy;turns safe&shy;ly from a&shy;far.
    <sup>220</sup>&#8239;As fam&shy;i&shy;ly re&shy;ceives a friend on his re&shy;turn, so do his good works wel&shy;come him who has done good, and has gone from this world to the next.
</p>


<h2>An&shy;ger</h2>
<p>
    <sup>221</sup>&#8239;Let a man leave an&shy;ger, for&shy;sake pride, and o&shy;ver&shy;come all bond&shy;age. No suf&shy;fer&shy;ing be&shy;falls the man who is de&shy;tached from name and form, and who calls noth&shy;ing his own.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>222</sup>&#8239;I call him a mas&shy;ter char&shy;i&shy;ot&shy;eer who holds back ris&shy;ing an&shy;ger like a rac&shy;ing char&shy;i&shy;ot.  Others mere&shy;ly hold the reins.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>223</sup>&#8239;O&shy;ver&shy;come an&shy;ger with love, e&shy;vil with good, greed with gen&shy;er&shy;os&shy;i&shy;ty, and lies with truth.
    <sup>224</sup>&#8239;Speak the truth, do not yield to an&shy;ger, and give, if asked, e&shy;ven if it&#x02BC;s on&shy;ly a lit&shy;tle.  By these three steps you will go near the gods.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>225</sup>&#8239;The sages who harm no one, and al&shy;ways con&shy;trol their bod&shy;y, go to the un&shy;change&shy;a&shy;ble state, where they suf&shy;fer no more.
    <sup>226</sup>&#8239;Those who are al&shy;ways vig&shy;i&shy;lant, stud&shy;y&shy;ing day and night, in&shy;tent on sal&shy;va&shy;tion, their pas&shy;sions fade a&shy;way.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>227</sup>&#8239;This is an old say&shy;ing, not just of to&shy;day: <q>They blame him who is si&shy;lent, they blame him who speaks much, they blame him who speaks lit&shy;tle.</q>  There is none on earth who es&shy;capes blame.
    <sup>228</sup>&#8239;There nev&shy;er was, there nev&shy;er will be, nor is there now, a man who is al&shy;ways blamed or al&shy;ways praised.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>229</sup>&#8239;If the knowl&shy;edge&shy;a&shy;ble praise him, hav&shy;ing ob&shy;served him day af&shy;ter day to be with&shy;out blem&shy;ish, wise, and rich in knowl&shy;edge and vir&shy;tue,
    <sup>230</sup>&#8239;like an in&shy;got of gold, who can blame him?  E&shy;ven the gods praise him.  E&shy;ven the Cre&shy;a&shy;tor praises him.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>231</sup>&#8239;With your bod&shy;y: be&shy;ware of an&shy;ger, be re&shy;strained, leave its sins, and with it prac&shy;tise vir&shy;tue.
    <sup>232</sup>&#8239;With your tongue: be&shy;ware of an&shy;ger, be re&shy;strained, leave its sins, and prac&shy;tise vir&shy;tue.
    <sup>233</sup>&#8239;With your mind: be&shy;ware of an&shy;ger, be re&shy;strained, leave its sins, and prac&shy;tise vir&shy;tue.
    <sup>234</sup>&#8239;The wise who con&shy;trol their bod&shy;y, their tongue, and their mind, are well con&shy;trolled in&shy;deed.
</p>


<h2>Im&shy;pu&shy;ri&shy;ty</h2>
<p>
    <sup>235</sup>&#8239;You are now like a with&shy;ered leaf, the mes&shy;sen&shy;gers of death stand near&shy;by.  You stand at the door of de&shy;par&shy;ture, yet have no pro&shy;vi&shy;sion for your jour&shy;ney.
    <sup>236</sup>&#8239;Make an is&shy;land for your&shy;self, work hard, be wise.  When your impurities are blown a&shy;way, and you are free from guilt, you will en&shy;ter in&shy;to the heav&shy;en&shy;ly world of the e&shy;lect.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>237</sup>&#8239;Your life has come to an end, you are near death, there is no re&shy;sting place for you on the road, yet you have no pro&shy;vi&shy;sion for your jour&shy;ney.
    <sup>238</sup>&#8239;Make an is&shy;land for your&shy;self, work hard, be wise.  When your impurities are blown a&shy;way, and you are free from guilt, you will not en&shy;ter a&shy;gain in&shy;to birth and de&shy;cay.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>239</sup>&#8239;Let a wise man re&shy;move his own impurities, as a smith re&shy;moves impurities from sil&shy;ver one by one, lit&shy;tle by lit&shy;tle, and mo&shy;ment by mo&shy;ment.
    <sup>240</sup>&#8239;Just as rust de&shy;stroys the i&shy;ron from which it springs, so do a transgressor&#x02BC;s deeds lead him to an e&shy;vil des&shy;ti&shy;na&shy;tion.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>241</sup>&#8239;The im&shy;pu&shy;ri&shy;ty of pray&shy;ers is not re&shy;cit&shy;ing them.  The im&shy;pu&shy;ri&shy;ty of hous&shy;es is not repairing them.  The im&shy;pu&shy;ri&shy;ty of beau&shy;ty is sloth. The im&shy;pu&shy;ri&shy;ty of a watch&shy;man is mind&shy;less&shy;ness.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>242</sup>&#8239;Sex&shy;u&shy;al mis&shy;con&shy;duct is the im&shy;pu&shy;ri&shy;ty of wom&shy;an, stin&shy;gi&shy;ness the im&shy;pu&shy;ri&shy;ty of a do&shy;nor. All e&shy;vil ways are impurities, both in this world and in the next.
    <sup>243</sup>&#8239;But there is an im&shy;pu&shy;ri&shy;ty worse than all oth&shy;ers: ig&shy;no&shy;rance. O monks, throw off that im&shy;pu&shy;ri&shy;ty to be&shy;come pure.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>244</sup>&#8239;Life is eas&shy;y for a shame&shy;less man, who is cun&shy;ning as a crow, who makes mis&shy;chief, and is in&shy;sult&shy;ing, ar&shy;ro&shy;gant, and cor&shy;rupt.
    <sup>245</sup>&#8239;But life is hard for a mod&shy;est man, who al&shy;ways seeks pu&shy;ri&shy;ty, is dis&shy;in&shy;ter&shy;est&shy;ed, qui&shy;et, spot&shy;less, and ob&shy;ser&shy;vant.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>246</sup>&#8239;He who de&shy;stroys life, speaks lies, takes what is not giv&shy;en, goes to an&shy;oth&shy;er man&#x02BC;s wife,
    <sup>247</sup>&#8239;and gives him&shy;self to in&shy;tox&shy;i&shy;cat&shy;ing liq&shy;uor, he digs up his own root here in this world.
    <sup>248</sup>&#8239;Know this, good man, that e&shy;vil is hard to con&shy;trol.  Do not let greed and vi&shy;ce bring you to pro&shy;longed grief.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>249</sup>&#8239;Peo&shy;ple give ac&shy;cord&shy;ing to their faith or con&shy;vic&shy;tion.  If a man worries a&shy;bout the food and drink giv&shy;en to oth&shy;ers, he will find no rest by day or night.
    <sup>250</sup>&#8239;He in whom that feel&shy;ing is cut down, up&shy;rooted, and de&shy;stroyed, finds rest by day and night.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>251</sup>&#8239;There is no fire like pas&shy;sion, no grip like ha&shy;tred, no snare like de&shy;lu&shy;sion, no riv&shy;er like crav&shy;ing.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>252</sup>&#8239;It is eas&shy;y to see the faults of oth&shy;ers, but dif&shy;fi&shy;cult to see one&#x02BC;s own.  A man win&shy;nows the faults of oth&shy;ers like chaff, but hides his own, like a cheat hides an un&shy;luck&shy;y throw of the dice.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>253</sup>&#8239;If a man fo&shy;cus&shy;es on the er&shy;rors of oth&shy;ers, and is al&shy;ways in&shy;clined to find fault, his own faults will grow, and he is far from destroying them.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>254</sup>&#8239;The world de&shy;lights in van&shy;i&shy;ty, but the a&shy;wak&shy;ened are free from it.
    <sup>255</sup>&#8239;No crea&shy;ture is e&shy;ter&shy;nal, but the a&shy;wak&shy;ened are nev&shy;er shak&shy;en.
</p>


<h2>The Just</h2>
<p>
    <sup>256</sup>&#8239;A man does not be&shy;come just by pass&shy;ing ar&shy;bi&shy;trar&shy;y judge&shy;ment.  No, he is called just who weighs both right and wrong,
    <sup>257</sup>&#8239;who judges im&shy;par&shy;tial&shy;ly and with&shy;out hur&shy;ry, in line with law, guarding the law, guard&shy;ed by the law, and who is in&shy;tel&shy;li&shy;gent.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>258</sup>&#8239;A man is not wise just be&shy;cause he talks a lot. He is called wise who is pa&shy;tient, and free from hos&shy;til&shy;i&shy;ty and fear.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>259</sup>&#8239;A man does not up&shy;hold the law just be&shy;cause he talks a lot.  He who has learn&shy;ed on&shy;ly a lit&shy;tle of the law, yet com&shy;pre&shy;hends it and nev&shy;er ne&shy;glects it, he up&shy;holds the law.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>260</sup>&#8239;A man is not an el&shy;der just be&shy;cause his hair is grey.  He may be ad&shy;vanced in years, but is called <q>one grown old in vain.</q>
    <sup>261</sup>&#8239;He in whom there is truth, vir&shy;tue, love, re&shy;straint, self con&shy;trol, who is free from im&shy;pu&shy;ri&shy;ty, and is wise, he is called an el&shy;der.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>262</sup>&#8239;El&shy;o&shy;quence or phys&shy;i&shy;cal beau&shy;ty do not make an en&shy;vi&shy;ous, greed&shy;y, dis&shy;hon&shy;est man re&shy;spect&shy;a&shy;ble.
    <sup>263</sup>&#8239;He is called re&shy;spect&shy;a&shy;ble when all these are cut down, up&shy;rooted, and de&shy;stroyed, when he is free from ha&shy;tred, and is wise.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>264</sup>&#8239;An un&shy;dis&shy;ci&shy;plined man who speaks lies does not be&shy;come a monk just by shav&shy;ing his head.  How can he be a monk who is held cap&shy;tive by de&shy;sire and greed?
    <sup>265</sup>&#8239;He who qui&shy;ets e&shy;vil, both small and large, is called a monk, be&shy;cause he has o&shy;ver&shy;come all e&shy;vil.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>266</sup>&#8239;A man is not a monk just be&shy;cause he asks for alms.  He who a&shy;dopts the whole law is a monk.
    <sup>267</sup>&#8239;He who is a&shy;bove both good and e&shy;vil, who is chaste, and who goes through the world with un&shy;der&shy;stand&shy;ing, he in&shy;deed is called a monk.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>268</sup>&#8239;A fool&shy;ish and ig&shy;no&shy;rant man does not be&shy;come a sage just by si&shy;lence.  But the wise, as if hold&shy;ing the scales, chooses good and a&shy;voids e&shy;vil.
    <sup>269</sup>&#8239;For this rea&shy;son he is a sage.  He who weighs both sides of this world is called a sage.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>270</sup>&#8239;A man does not be&shy;come no&shy;ble by harming liv&shy;ing crea&shy;tures.  He is called no&shy;ble for harming no liv&shy;ing thing.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>271</sup>&#8239;Not by rules and prac&shy;tices, not by much learn&shy;ing, not by great con&shy;cen&shy;tra&shy;tion, not by life in se&shy;clu&shy;sion,
    <sup>272</sup>&#8239;not by think&shy;ing, <q>I en&shy;joy the hap&shy;pi&shy;ness of re&shy;nun&shy;ci&shy;a&shy;tion which no world&shy;ling can know</q>, should the monk be con&shy;fi&shy;dent with&shy;out attaining the ex&shy;tinc&shy;tion of de&shy;sires.
</p>


<h2>The Path</h2>
<p>
    <sup>273</sup>&#8239;Of paths, the Eight&shy;fold is best.  Of truths, the Four No&shy;ble are best.  Of vir&shy;tues, de&shy;tach&shy;ment is best.  Of men, he who has eyes to see is best.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>274</sup>&#8239;This is the on&shy;ly path, there is no oth&shy;er, to pu&shy;ri&shy;fy vi&shy;sion. Fol&shy;low this path and it will be&shy;wil&shy;der the tempter.
    <sup>275</sup>&#8239;Fol&shy;low&shy;ing this path will end pain.  Once I un&shy;der&shy;stood how to re&shy;move thorns in the flesh, I preached this path.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>276</sup>&#8239;You your&shy;self must make an ef&shy;fort.  Buddhas on&shy;ly show the way. The thought&shy;ful who fol&shy;low the path are freed from the tempter&#x02BC;s bonds.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>277</sup>&#8239;<q>All cre&shy;at&shy;ed things are tem&shy;po&shy;rar&shy;y.</q>  He who sees and knows this turns a&shy;way from pain.  This is the path to pu&shy;ri&shy;ty.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>278</sup>&#8239;<q>All cre&shy;at&shy;ed things are pain&shy;ful.</q>  He who sees and knows this turns a&shy;way from pain.  This is the path to pu&shy;ri&shy;ty.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>280</sup>&#8239;He who does not ex&shy;ert him&shy;self when it is time, who, though young and strong, is full of sloth, whose will and mind are weak, that la&shy;zy and i&shy;dle man will nev&shy;er find the path to knowl&shy;edge.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>281</sup>&#8239;Let a man watch his speech, be well re&shy;strained in mind, and nev&shy;er com&shy;mit wrong with his bod&shy;y.  If a man purifies these three cours&shy;es of ac&shy;tion, he will a&shy;chieve the path taught by the wise.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>282</sup>&#8239;Zeal brings knowl&shy;edge.  Lack of zeal loses knowl&shy;edge.  Know&shy;ing these two paths of gain and loss, let a man con&shy;duct him&shy;self so that knowl&shy;edge may grow.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>283</sup>&#8239;Cut down the whole for&shy;est of de&shy;sire, not just one tree.  Dan&shy;ger co&shy;mes from the for&shy;est.  Once you have cut down this for&shy;est and its un&shy;der&shy;growth, monks, you will be free.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>284</sup>&#8239;As long as the smallest crav&shy;ing of man for wom&shy;an is not de&shy;stroyed, his mind is in bond&shy;age, as the suck&shy;ing calf to its moth&shy;er.
    <sup>285</sup>&#8239;Cut out the love of self, like an au&shy;tumn lo&shy;tus with your hand. Cher&shy;ish the road of peace, sal&shy;va&shy;tion, as shown by the a&shy;wak&shy;ened.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>286</sup>&#8239;<q>I will live here dur&shy;ing the rains, and o&shy;ver here in win&shy;ter and sum&shy;mer.</q>  Thus thinks the fool, un&shy;a&shy;ware of ob&shy;struc&shy;tions.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>287</sup>&#8239;Death carries off the man, praised for his chil&shy;dren and flocks, his mind dis&shy;tract&shy;ed, as a flood carries off a sleep&shy;ing vil&shy;lage.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>288</sup>&#8239;For him whom death has seized, kinsmen are no pro&shy;tec&shy;tion. Nei&shy;ther sons, a fa&shy;ther, nor re&shy;la&shy;tions can give shel&shy;ter.
    <sup>289</sup>&#8239;Know&shy;ing this, a wise and good man should quick&shy;ly clear the path lead&shy;ing to sal&shy;va&shy;tion.
</p>


<h2>Mis&shy;cel&shy;la&shy;ne&shy;ous</h2>
<p>
    <sup>290</sup>&#8239;If by leav&shy;ing a small pleas&shy;ure one sees a great pleas&shy;ure, let a wise man leave the small pleas&shy;ure and look to the great.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>291</sup>&#8239;He who seeks pleas&shy;ure for him&shy;self by caus&shy;ing pain to oth&shy;ers is entangled by the bonds of ha&shy;tred, and can&shy;not be free from ha&shy;tred.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>292</sup>&#8239;Desires al&shy;ways in&shy;crease for un&shy;ru&shy;ly, heed&shy;less peo&shy;ple who ne&shy;glect what should be done and do what should not be done.
    <sup>293</sup>&#8239;But de&shy;sires will come to an end for watch&shy;ful, wise peo&shy;ple who do not do what should not be done, who stead&shy;fast&shy;ly do what should be done, and whose whole watch&shy;ful&shy;ness is al&shy;ways di&shy;rect&shy;ed to their bod&shy;y.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>296</sup>&#8239;The dis&shy;ci&shy;ples of Gotama are wide a&shy;wake and vig&shy;i&shy;lant, and their minds day and night are al&shy;ways set on the Awakened,
    <sup>297</sup>&#8239;on the law,
    <sup>298</sup>&#8239;on the church,
    <sup>299</sup>&#8239;and on their bod&shy;y.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>300</sup>&#8239;The dis&shy;ci&shy;ples of Gotama are wide a&shy;wake and vig&shy;i&shy;lant, and their minds day and night al&shy;ways de&shy;light in com&shy;pas&shy;sion,
    <sup>301</sup>&#8239;and in med&shy;i&shy;ta&shy;tion.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>302</sup>&#8239;It is hard to be a monk.  It is hard to en&shy;joy that life. House&shy;hold life is al&shy;so hard and pain&shy;ful.  It is pain&shy;ful to dwell with un&shy;e&shy;quals and the wan&shy;der&shy;ing monk is be&shy;set with pain. There&shy;fore let no man wan&shy;der aim&shy;less&shy;ly and he will not be be&shy;set with pain.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>303</sup>&#8239;A faith&shy;ful, vir&shy;tu&shy;ous, rep&shy;u&shy;ta&shy;ble, and wealth&shy;y man is re&shy;spected wher&shy;ev&shy;er he goes.
    <sup>304</sup>&#8239;Like the Himalayas, good peo&shy;ple shine from a&shy;far.  Like ar&shy;rows shot by night, bad peo&shy;ple are un&shy;seen e&shy;ven when they are near.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>305</sup>&#8239;He who sits a&shy;lone, sleeps a&shy;lone, wa&shy;lks a&shy;lone, is dil&shy;i&shy;gent, and sub&shy;dues him&shy;self a&shy;lone, will re&shy;joice in the sol&shy;i&shy;tude of the for&shy;est.
</p>


<h2>Hell</h2>
<p>
    <sup>306</sup>&#8239;He goes to hell, the one who as&shy;serts what didn&#x02BC;t hap&shy;pen, and the one who did a thing but says, <q>I have not done it</q>.  They are both e&shy;vil&shy;do&shy;ers, and are e&shy;qual in the next world.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>307</sup>&#8239;Man&shy;y men who wear the saf&shy;fron robe are ill-mannered and un&shy;re&shy;strained.  Such e&shy;vil&shy;do&shy;ers by their e&shy;vil deeds go to hell.
    <sup>308</sup>&#8239;It would be bet&shy;ter to swal&shy;low an i&shy;ron ball, red-hot and a&shy;flame, than for an im&shy;mor&shy;al, un&shy;re&shy;strained man to eat the alms of the peo&shy;ple.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>309</sup>&#8239;A wreckless man who lies down with his neigh&shy;bor&#x02BC;s wife gains four things: a bad rep&shy;u&shy;ta&shy;tion, poor sleep, pun&shy;ish&shy;ment, and hell.
    <sup>310</sup>&#8239;There is bad rep&shy;u&shy;ta&shy;tion, an e&shy;vil des&shy;ti&shy;na&shy;tion, the brief pleas&shy;ure of the fright&shy;ened man and wom&shy;an, and the king im&shy;poses a heav&shy;y pun&shy;ish&shy;ment.  There&shy;fore, let no man lie down with his neigh&shy;bor&#x02BC;s wife.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>311</sup>&#8239;Just as a blade of grass, if wrong&shy;ly han&shy;dled, cuts the hand, so does as&shy;cet&shy;i&shy;cism, if wrong&shy;ly prac&shy;tised, lead to hell.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>312</sup>&#8239;An act per&shy;formed care&shy;less&shy;ly, a bro&shy;ken vow, and ques&shy;tion&shy;a&shy;ble cel&shy;i&shy;ba&shy;cy, none of these bring much re&shy;ward.
    <sup>313</sup>&#8239;If an&shy;y&shy;thing is to be done, then do it vig&shy;or&shy;ous&shy;ly.  A care&shy;less pil&shy;grim on&shy;ly scat&shy;ters the dust of his pas&shy;sions more wide&shy;ly.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>314</sup>&#8239;It is bet&shy;ter not to do an e&shy;vil deed, for an e&shy;vil deed tor&shy;ments a man af&shy;ter&shy;wards.  It is bet&shy;ter to do a good deed, for hav&shy;ing done it, one is not tor&shy;mented.
    <sup>315</sup>&#8239;Like a fron&shy;tier fort with de&shy;fences in&shy;side and out, so let a man guard him&shy;self.  Do not let a mo&shy;ment pas&shy;s by, for they who al&shy;low the right mo&shy;ment to pas&shy;s, suf&shy;fer pain when con&shy;signed to hell.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>316</sup>&#8239;They who are a&shy;shamed of what is not shame&shy;ful, and are not a&shy;shamed of what is shame&shy;ful, such men, em&shy;brac&shy;ing false doc&shy;trines go to an e&shy;vil des&shy;ti&shy;na&shy;tion.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>317</sup>&#8239;They who see dan&shy;ger where there is none, and see no dan&shy;ger where there is, such men, em&shy;brac&shy;ing false doc&shy;trines go to an e&shy;vil des&shy;ti&shy;na&shy;tion.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>318</sup>&#8239;They who see wrong where there is none, and see no wrong where there is, such men, em&shy;brac&shy;ing false doc&shy;trines go to an e&shy;vil des&shy;ti&shy;na&shy;tion.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>319</sup>&#8239;They who see wrong as wrong, and see right as right, such men, em&shy;brac&shy;ing true doc&shy;trine go to a good des&shy;ti&shy;na&shy;tion.
</p>


<h2>The El&shy;e&shy;phant</h2>
<p>
    <sup>320</sup>&#8239;As an el&shy;e&shy;phant in bat&shy;tle en&shy;dures an ar&shy;row shot from a bow, so will I en&shy;dure def&shy;a&shy;ma&shy;tion.  Man&shy;y peo&shy;ple lack vir&shy;tue.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>321</sup>&#8239;They on&shy;ly lead a tamed el&shy;e&shy;phant in&shy;to crowds.  The king on&shy;ly rides a tamed el&shy;e&shy;phant.  The tamed man who en&shy;dures def&shy;a&shy;ma&shy;tion is the best a&shy;mong men.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>322</sup>&#8239;Trained mules, thor&shy;ough&shy;bred hors&shy;es, and el&shy;e&shy;phants with large tusks are ex&shy;cel&shy;lent, but he who tames him&shy;self is bet&shy;ter still.
    <sup>323</sup>&#8239;For with these an&shy;i&shy;mals no man reaches the un&shy;trod&shy;den coun&shy;try, where a tamed man goes by tam&shy;ing him&shy;self.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>324</sup>&#8239;The el&shy;e&shy;phant called Dhanapalaka, deep in rut, is dif&shy;fi&shy;cult to hold.  He does not eat a mor&shy;sel in cap&shy;tiv&shy;i&shy;ty, but longs for the el&shy;e&shy;phant grove.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>325</sup>&#8239;When a man is in&shy;ac&shy;tive and glut&shy;ton&shy;ous, sleep&shy;ing and roll&shy;ing a&shy;round in bed like an o&shy;ver&shy;fed hog, that fool is born a&shy;gain and a&shy;gain.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>326</sup>&#8239;This mind used to wan&shy;der a&shy;bout as it liked, wher&shy;ev&shy;er it wished, how&shy;ev&shy;er it pleased.  Now I will hold it in check, as a rid&shy;er with a hook con&shy;trols an el&shy;e&shy;phant in rut.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>327</sup>&#8239;De&shy;light in mind&shy;ful&shy;ness.  Watch o&shy;ver your mind.  Lift your&shy;self out of the e&shy;vil way, as an el&shy;e&shy;phant lifts it&shy;self out of the mud.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>328</sup>&#8239;If you find a wise, pru&shy;dent, and vir&shy;tu&shy;ous friend, then, o&shy;ver&shy;com&shy;ing all dan&shy;gers, walk with him joy&shy;ful&shy;ly and mind&shy;ful&shy;ly.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>329</sup>&#8239;If you find no friend who is wise, pru&shy;dent and vir&shy;tu&shy;ous, then walk a&shy;lone, like a king leav&shy;ing be&shy;hind his king&shy;dom, like an el&shy;e&shy;phant in the for&shy;est.
    <sup>330</sup>&#8239;It is bet&shy;ter to live a&shy;lone.  There is no com&shy;pan&shy;ion&shy;ship with a fool.  Live a&shy;lone, do no e&shy;vil, and be con&shy;tent, like an el&shy;e&shy;phant in the for&shy;est.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>331</sup>&#8239;These are good: friends when the need a&shy;rises, con&shy;tent&shy;ment with what you have, mer&shy;it in the hour of death, giv&shy;ing up all grief,
    <sup>332</sup>&#8239;serv&shy;ing your moth&shy;er, serv&shy;ing your fa&shy;ther, serv&shy;ing monks, serv&shy;ing ho&shy;ly men,
    <sup>333</sup>&#8239;vir&shy;tue last&shy;ing in&shy;to old age, firm&shy;ly root&shy;ed faith, attaining dis&shy;cern&shy;ment, avoiding e&shy;vil.
</p>


<h2>Crav&shy;ing</h2>
<p>
    <sup>334</sup>&#8239;The crav&shy;ing of a heed&shy;less man grows like a creep&shy;ing vine.  He runs from life to life, like a mon&shy;key seek&shy;ing fruit in the for&shy;est.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>335</sup>&#8239;He who is o&shy;ver&shy;come by this vile and cling&shy;ing crav&shy;ing, his suf&shy;fer&shy;ing in&shy;creases like grass af&shy;ter rain.
    <sup>336</sup>&#8239;He who o&shy;ver&shy;comes this vile crav&shy;ing, so dif&shy;fi&shy;cult to con&shy;quer, suf&shy;fer&shy;ing falls off him like wa&shy;ter drops from a lo&shy;tus leaf.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>337</sup>&#8239;To all as&shy;sem&shy;bled here I say, <q>Good luck.  Dig up the root of crav&shy;ing, like one seek&shy;ing the sweet scented root of birana grass. Let not the tempter crush you a&shy;gain and a&shy;gain, as the stream crushes a reed.</q>
    <sup>338</sup>&#8239;A tree will grow a&shy;gain, e&shy;ven if cut down, as long as its root is safe and firm.  Thus, un&shy;less la&shy;tent crav&shy;ing is de&shy;stroyed, suf&shy;fer&shy;ing will re&shy;turn a&shy;gain and a&shy;gain.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>339</sup>&#8239;The thir&shy;ty six streams of crav&shy;ing flow to&shy;wards pleas&shy;ure. The mis&shy;guid&shy;ed man, in whom they flow strongly, is car&shy;ried a&shy;way.
    <sup>340</sup>&#8239;The streams flow eve&shy;ry&shy;where.  The creep&shy;ing vines of crav&shy;ing grow eve&shy;ry&shy;where.  If you see the vine spring up, cut its root with knowl&shy;edge.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>342</sup>&#8239;Driv&shy;en by crav&shy;ing, men run a&shy;bout like a snared rab&shy;bit.  Held by fet&shy;ters and bonds, they suf&shy;fer a&shy;gain and a&shy;gain for a long time.
    <sup>343</sup>&#8239;Driv&shy;en by crav&shy;ing, men run a&shy;bout like a snared rab&shy;bit.  So a monk should drive out crav&shy;ing, and strive to be with&shy;out pas&shy;sion.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>345</sup>&#8239;The wise do not say that a fet&shy;ter made of i&shy;ron, wood, or hemp is strong.  Far stronger is a long&shy;ing for jew&shy;els and or&shy;na&shy;ments, chil&shy;dren and wives.
    <sup>346</sup>&#8239;The wise say that a strong fet&shy;ter dra&shy;gs one down, though seem&shy;ing loose, it is dif&shy;fi&shy;cult to re&shy;move.  Af&shy;ter hav&shy;ing cut it, the wise are free from cares, and leave the world, de&shy;sires, and pleas&shy;ures be&shy;hind.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>348</sup>&#8239;Give up the past, the fu&shy;ture, and the pre&shy;sent, to cross to the oth&shy;er shore of ex&shy;ist&shy;ence.  If your mind is com&shy;plete&shy;ly free, you will not en&shy;ter in&shy;to birth and de&shy;cay a&shy;gain.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>349</sup>&#8239;If a man is tossed a&shy;bout by doubts, full of pas&shy;sion, and fo&shy;cused on pleas&shy;ure, his crav&shy;ing grows more and more.  He makes his fet&shy;ters strong, in&shy;deed.
    <sup>350</sup>&#8239;If a man de&shy;lights in quieting doubts, is al&shy;ways mind&shy;ful, and med&shy;i&shy;tates on the impurities, he will end crav&shy;ing and cut the fet&shy;ter of the tempter.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>351</sup>&#8239;He who has reached the goal is with&shy;out fear, is with&shy;out crav&shy;ing, is with&shy;out blem&shy;ish, and has re&shy;moved all the thorns of life: this will be his last bod&shy;y.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>354</sup>&#8239;The gift of the law ex&shy;ceeds all gifts.  The taste of the law ex&shy;ceeds all tastes.  De&shy;light in the law ex&shy;ceeds all de&shy;lights. The ex&shy;tinc&shy;tion of crav&shy;ing o&shy;ver&shy;comes all suf&shy;fer&shy;ing.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>355</sup>&#8239;Rich&shy;es de&shy;stroy the fool&shy;ish, but not those who seek the be&shy;yond. The fool, by crav&shy;ing for rich&shy;es, de&shy;stroys him&shy;self and oth&shy;ers.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>356</sup>&#8239;Weeds spoil a field.  Pas&shy;sion spoils a man.  There&shy;fore, a gift giv&shy;en to those with&shy;out pas&shy;sion yields great fruit.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>357</sup>&#8239;Weeds spoil a field.  Ha&shy;tred spoils a man.  There&shy;fore, a gift giv&shy;en to those with&shy;out ha&shy;tred yields great fruit.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>358</sup>&#8239;Weeds spoil a field.  De&shy;lu&shy;sion spoils a man.  There&shy;fore, a gift giv&shy;en to those with&shy;out de&shy;lu&shy;sion yields great fruit.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>359</sup>&#8239;Weeds spoil a field.  De&shy;sire spoils a man.  There&shy;fore, a gift giv&shy;en to those with&shy;out de&shy;sire yields great fruit.
</p>


<h2>The Monk</h2>
<p>
    <sup>360</sup>&#8239;Good is re&shy;straint o&shy;ver the eye, o&shy;ver the ear, o&shy;ver the nose, and o&shy;ver the tongue.
    <sup>361</sup>&#8239;Good is re&shy;straint in the bod&shy;y, in speech, in mind, in all things. A monk, re&shy;strained in all things, is freed from all suf&shy;fer&shy;ing.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>362</sup>&#8239;He who con&shy;trols his hands, feet, and speech; who is well con&shy;trolled, de&shy;lights in the in&shy;ward, is col&shy;lect&shy;ed, sol&shy;i&shy;tar&shy;y and con&shy;tent, him they call a monk.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>363</sup>&#8239;The monk who con&shy;trols his tongue, speaks mod&shy;er&shy;ate&shy;ly and calm&shy;ly, and teaches the law and its mean&shy;ing, his speech is sweet.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>364</sup>&#8239;The monk who a&shy;bides in the law, de&shy;lights in the law, med&shy;i&shy;tates on the law, and keeps the law in mind, he will nev&shy;er fall a&shy;way from the true law.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>365</sup>&#8239;Let him not de&shy;spise what he has re&shy;ceived, nor en&shy;vy oth&shy;ers.  A monk who envies oth&shy;ers does not ob&shy;tain con&shy;cen&shy;tra&shy;tion.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>366</sup>&#8239;If a monk lives pure&shy;ly, is dil&shy;i&shy;gent, and does not de&shy;spise what he has re&shy;ceived, though he re&shy;ceives lit&shy;tle, then e&shy;ven the gods will praise him.
    <sup>368</sup>&#8239;The monk who a&shy;bides in kind&shy;ness, and is de&shy;vot&shy;ed to the teach&shy;ings of Bud&shy;dha, will at&shy;tain peace, hap&shy;pi&shy;ness, and ces&shy;sa&shy;tion of nat&shy;u&shy;ral de&shy;sires.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>369</sup>&#8239;Monk, bail out this boat.  Once bailed, it will sail light&shy;ly. Hav&shy;ing cut out pas&shy;sion and ha&shy;tred, you will reach Sal&shy;va&shy;tion.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>371</sup>&#8239;Med&shy;i&shy;tate monk.  Be mind&shy;ful.  Do not di&shy;rect your mind to sen&shy;su&shy;al pleas&shy;ure.  Heed&shy;less, do not swal&shy;low the flam&shy;ing i&shy;ron ball lest you cry out when burn&shy;ing, <q>This is suf&shy;fer&shy;ing.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>372</sup>&#8239;There is no med&shy;i&shy;ta&shy;tion with&shy;out in&shy;sight.  There is no in&shy;sight with&shy;out med&shy;i&shy;ta&shy;tion.  He who has in&shy;sight and med&shy;i&shy;ta&shy;tion is near Sal&shy;va&shy;tion.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>373</sup>&#8239;A monk who has en&shy;tered his emp&shy;ty house, whose mind is tran&shy;quil, and who sees the law clear&shy;ly, feels a de&shy;light more than hu&shy;man.
    <sup>374</sup>&#8239;Once he has con&shy;sid&shy;ered the or&shy;i&shy;gin and de&shy;struc&shy;tion of the el&shy;e&shy;ments of the bod&shy;y, he finds hap&shy;pi&shy;ness and joy be&shy;long&shy;ing to those who know the im&shy;mor&shy;tal.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>375</sup>&#8239;This is the be&shy;gin&shy;ning for a wise monk: guarding the senses, con&shy;tent&shy;ment, re&shy;straint un&shy;der the law.
    <sup>376</sup>&#8239;He should have friends who are no&shy;ble, en&shy;er&shy;get&shy;ic, and pure. He should be friend&shy;ly, and skilled in con&shy;duct.  Then, hav&shy;ing much joy, he will put an end to suf&shy;fer&shy;ing.

<p>
    <sup>377</sup>&#8239;Shed pas&shy;sion and ha&shy;tred, O monks, as the jas&shy;mine plant sheds its with&shy;ered flow&shy;ers.
    <sup>378</sup>&#8239;That monk is called qui&shy;et whose bod&shy;y and speech and mind are calm, who is col&shy;lect&shy;ed, and who has purged the baits of the world.

    <sup>386</sup>&#8239;He who is mind&shy;ful, blame&shy;less, settled, du&shy;ti&shy;ful, with&shy;out pas&shy;sions, and who has at&shy;tained the highest goal, him I call a ho&shy;ly man.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>387</sup>&#8239;The sun shines by day, the moon shines by night, the war&shy;ri&shy;or shines in ar&shy;mor, the ho&shy;ly man shines in med&shy;i&shy;ta&shy;tion.  But the Awakened One shines with splen&shy;dor day and night.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>388</sup>&#8239;A man is called ho&shy;ly for discarding e&shy;vil, con&shy;tem&shy;pla&shy;tive for walk&shy;ing qui&shy;et&shy;ly, a pil&shy;grim for leav&shy;ing his own impurities.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>389</sup>&#8239;No one should at&shy;tack a ho&shy;ly man, but no ho&shy;ly man, if at&shy;tacked, should give in to his an&shy;ger.  Shame on him who at&shy;tacks a ho&shy;ly man, but more shame to him who gives in to his an&shy;ger.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>390</sup>&#8239;Noth&shy;ing is bet&shy;ter for a ho&shy;ly man than to hold his mind back from the pleas&shy;ures of life.  When all de&shy;sire to in&shy;jure has van&shy;ished, pain ceases.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>391</sup>&#8239;I call him a ho&shy;ly man who does not of&shy;fend in bod&shy;y, word, or mind, and is re&shy;strained on these three points.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>392</sup>&#8239;Re&shy;vere that teach&shy;er who has taught you the law as taught by the Bud&shy;dha, just as a ho&shy;ly man&shy;y re&shy;veres the sac&shy;ri&shy;fi&shy;cial fire.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>393</sup>&#8239;A man does not be&shy;come ho&shy;ly by his mat&shy;ted hair, by his fam&shy;i&shy;ly, or by birth.  He in whom there is truth and right&shy;eous&shy;ness, he is pure, he is a ho&shy;ly man.
    <sup>394</sup>&#8239;What use is mat&shy;ted hair, O fool?  What use is your coat of goat skins?  The tan&shy;gle is with&shy;in you, but you comb the out&shy;side.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>397</sup>&#8239;I call him a ho&shy;ly man who has cut eve&shy;ry fet&shy;ter, is fear&shy;less, in&shy;de&shy;pend&shy;ent and unshackled.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>399</sup>&#8239;I call him a ho&shy;ly man who, with&shy;out an&shy;ger, en&shy;dures in&shy;sult, im&shy;pris&shy;on&shy;ment, and beat&shy;ing, who has pa&shy;tience like the strength of an ar&shy;my.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>400</sup>&#8239;I call him a ho&shy;ly man who is free from an&shy;ger, du&shy;ti&shy;ful, vir&shy;tu&shy;ous, with&shy;out crav&shy;ing, sub&shy;dued, and who has re&shy;ceived his last bod&shy;y.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>401</sup>&#8239;I call him a ho&shy;ly man who does not cling to pleas&shy;ures, like wa&shy;ter on a lo&shy;tus leaf or a mus&shy;tard seed on the tip of a nee&shy;dle.
    <sup>402</sup>&#8239;I call him a ho&shy;ly man who, e&shy;ven here, dis&shy;cerns the end of his suf&shy;fer&shy;ing, has put down his bur&shy;den, and is unshackled.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>403</sup>&#8239;I call him a ho&shy;ly man who is wise, has deep un&shy;der&shy;stand&shy;ing, dis&shy;cerns the right and wrong path, and has reached the ul&shy;ti&shy;mate goal.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>404</sup>&#8239;I call him a ho&shy;ly man who keeps a&shy;loof from both laymen and as&shy;cet&shy;ic, who has no per&shy;ma&shy;nent home, and few de&shy;sires.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>405</sup>&#8239;I call him a ho&shy;ly man who re&shy;nounces vi&shy;o&shy;lence to&shy;wards all be&shy;ings, wheth&shy;er weak or strong, and nei&shy;ther kills nor causes oth&shy;ers to kill.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>407</sup>&#8239;I call him a ho&shy;ly man from whom pas&shy;sion and ha&shy;tred, pride and en&shy;vy have dropped like a mus&shy;tard seed from the tip of a nee&shy;dle.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>408</sup>&#8239;I call him a ho&shy;ly man who speaks true and in&shy;struc&shy;tive words, free from harsh&shy;ness, so that he of&shy;fends no one.
    <sup>409</sup>&#8239;I call him a ho&shy;ly man who on&shy;ly takes what is giv&shy;en to him, be it long or short, small or large, good or bad.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>412</sup>&#8239;I call him a ho&shy;ly man who, in this world, is a&shy;bove at&shy;tach&shy;ment to mer&shy;it and e&shy;vil, is with&shy;out grief, stain&shy;less, and pure.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>416</sup>&#8239;I call him a ho&shy;ly man who, leav&shy;ing all crav&shy;ing, trav&shy;els with&shy;out a home, and in whom all crav&shy;ing is ex&shy;tinct.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>417</sup>&#8239;I call him a ho&shy;ly man who, af&shy;ter leav&shy;ing all at&shy;tach&shy;ment to men, has ris&shy;en a&shy;bove all at&shy;tach&shy;ment to the gods, and is free from eve&shy;ry at&shy;tach&shy;ment.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>421</sup>&#8239;I call him a ho&shy;ly man who does not cling to past, pre&shy;sent, or fu&shy;ture, who has noth&shy;ing, who clings to noth&shy;ing.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>422</sup>&#8239;I call him a ho&shy;ly man, the fear&shy;less, the no&shy;ble, the he&shy;ro&shy;ic, the great sage, the con&shy;quer&shy;or, the pas&shy;sion&shy;less, the pure, the a&shy;wak&shy;ened.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>423</sup>&#8239;I call him a ho&shy;ly man who knows his for&shy;mer lives, who sees heav&shy;en and hell, has reached the end of births, is per&shy;fect in knowl&shy;edge, a sage, and who has mas&shy;tered all there is to mas&shy;ter.
