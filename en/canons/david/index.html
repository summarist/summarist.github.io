    <p>
    <sup>2:11</sup>&#8239;Serve the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> with fear and rejoice with trembling.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>4:4</sup>&#8239;In your anger, do not sin. Ponder in your heart on your bed and be still.
    <sup>5</sup>&#8239;Offer the sacrifices of righteousness and put your trust in the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>12:8</sup>&#8239;The wicked walk on every side when vileness is exalted among the children of men.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>15:1</sup>&#8239;<span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, who may sojourn in your tent? Who may dwell on your holy hill?
    <sup>2</sup>&#8239;He who walks with integrity and does what is right and speaks truth in his heart;
    <sup>3</sup>&#8239;who does not slander with his tongue and does no evil to his neighbor and does not take up a reproach against his friend;
    <sup>4</sup>&#8239;who despises a vile person but honors those who fear the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>; who keeps a promise even when it hurts and does not change;
    <sup>5</sup>&#8239;who does not loan out his money with interest and does not take a bribe against the innocent. He who does these things shall never be moved.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>18:25</sup>&#8239;The <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> shows mercy to the merciful.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>18:30</sup>&#8239;The word of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> proves true. He is a shield to all who take refuge in him.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>19:1</sup>&#8239;The heavens declare the glory of God and the skies show his handiwork.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>19:7</sup>&#8239;The law of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> is perfect, reviving the soul. The testimony of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> is trustworthy, making wise the simple.
    <sup>8</sup>&#8239;The precepts of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> are right, rejoicing the heart. The commandment of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> is pure, enlightening the eyes.
    <sup>9</sup>&#8239;The fear of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> is clean, enduring for ever. The laws of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> are true and righteous altogether.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>27:14</sup>&#8239;Wait for the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>. Be strong and let your heart take courage. Wait for the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>30:5</sup>&#8239;Weeping may last for a night, but joy comes in the morning.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>32:10</sup>&#8239;Many sorrows come to the wicked, but loving-kindness surrounds him who trusts in the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>33:6</sup>&#8239;By the word of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> the heavens were made and all their host by the breath of his mouth.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>34:13</sup>&#8239;Keep your tongue from evil and your lips from speaking deceit.
    <sup>14</sup>&#8239;Depart from evil and do good. Seek peace and pursue it.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>37:1</sup>&#8239;Fret not because of evildoers, and envy not wrongdoers.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>37:7</sup>&#8239;Be still before the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> and wait patiently for him. Fret not because of him who prospers in his way; because of him who carries out wicked schemes.
    <sup>8</sup>&#8239;Cease from anger and forsake wrath. Fret not&mdash;it leads only to evildoing.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>37:16</sup>&#8239;A little that the righteous has is better than the abundance of many wicked.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>37:21</sup>&#8239;The wicked borrows and does not pay back, but the righteous is generous and gives.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>39:1</sup>&#8239;I said, <q>I will guard my ways so that I may not sin with my tongue. I will muzzle my mouth while the wicked are in my presence.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>41:1</sup>&#8239;Blessed is he who considers the poor. The <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> will deliver him in the day of trouble.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>46:1</sup>&#8239;God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>46:10</sup>&#8239;Be still and know that I am God.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>49:16</sup>&#8239;Do not be afraid when one is made rich, when the splendor of his house increases.
    <sup>17</sup>&#8239;For when he dies he will carry nothing away. His glory will not descend after him.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>50:14</sup>&#8239;Offer to God a sacrifice of thanksgiving and pay your vows to the Most High
    <sup>15</sup>&#8239;and call on me in the day of trouble. I will deliver you and you will glorify me.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>55:22</sup>&#8239;Cast your burden on the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> and he will sustain you. He will never allow the righteous to be moved.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>82:3</sup>&#8239;Defend the poor and fatherless. Do justice to the afflicted and destitute.
    <sup>4</sup>&#8239;Res&shy;cue the poor and needy. Deliver them from the hand of the wicked.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>92:12</sup>&#8239;The righteous will flourish like the palm tree. He will grow like a cedar in Lebanon.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>96:2</sup>&#8239;Sing to the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, bless his name. Proclaim his salvation from day to day.
    <sup>3</sup>&#8239;De&shy;clare his glory among the nations, his marvellous deeds among all the peoples.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>100:1</sup>&#8239;Make a joyful noise to the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, all the earth.
    <sup>2</sup>&#8239;Serve the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> with gladness. Come before him with singing.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>102:17</sup>&#8239;The <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> regards the prayer of the destitute and does not despise their prayer.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>103:8</sup>&#8239;The <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> is merciful and gracious, slow to anger, abounding in loving-kindness.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>105:1</sup>&#8239;Oh give thanks to the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>. Call on his name. Make known his deeds among the peoples.
    <sup>2</sup>&#8239;Sing to him. Sing praises to him. Talk about all his marvelous deeds.
    <sup>3</sup>&#8239;Glory in his holy name. Let the hearts of those who seek the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> rejoice.
    <sup>4</sup>&#8239;Seek the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> and his strength. Seek his face continually.
    <sup>5</sup>&#8239;Re&shy;mem&shy;ber the wonders that he has done, his miracles and the judgments he has pronounced.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>106:1</sup>&#8239;Praise the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>. Oh give thanks to the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, for he is good; for his loving-kindness endures forever.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>111:10</sup>&#8239;The fear of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> is the beginning of wisdom. Those who obey his commandments have good understanding.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>112:1</sup>&#8239;Blessed is the man who fears the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, who delights greatly in his commandments.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>112:4</sup>&#8239;For the upright, light arises in the darkness. He is gracious, merciful and righteous.
    <sup>5</sup>&#8239;It is well with the man who deals generously and lends, who conducts his affairs with justice.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>118:8</sup>&#8239;It is better to take refuge in the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> than to put confidence in man.
    <sup>9</sup>&#8239;It is better to take refuge in the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> than to put confidence in princes.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>122:6</sup>&#8239;Pray for the peace of Jerusalem.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>127:1</sup>&#8239;Except the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> build the house, they labor in vain who build it.  Except the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> keep the city, the watchman stays awake in vain.
    <sup>2</sup>&#8239;It is vain for you to rise up early, to stay up late, to eat the bread of toil&mdash;for he gives sleep to his beloved.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>127:3</sup>&#8239;Behold, children are a heritage from the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> and the fruit of the womb is a reward.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>133:1</sup>&#8239;Behold, how good and pleasant it is for brothers to live together in unity.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>136:1</sup>&#8239;Oh give thanks to the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, for he is good. His loving-kindness endures for ever.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>146:3</sup>&#8239;Do not put your trust in princes or in the son of man, who cannot save.
