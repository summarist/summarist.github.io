    </div>
    <p>
    <sup>2:11</sup>&#8239;Serve <span class="small-caps">God</span> with fear and re&shy;joice with trembling.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>4:4</sup>&#8239;In your an&shy;ger, do not sin. Pon&shy;der in your heart on your bed and be still.
    <sup>5</sup>&#8239;Of&shy;fer the sac&shy;ri&shy;fices of right&shy;eous&shy;ness and put your trust in <span class="small-caps">God</span>.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>12:8</sup>&#8239;The wick&shy;ed walk on eve&shy;ry side when vile&shy;ness is ex&shy;alt&shy;ed a&shy;mong the chil&shy;dren of men.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>15:1</sup>&#8239;<span class="small-caps">God</span>, who may so&shy;journ in your tent? Who may dwell on your ho&shy;ly hill?
    <sup>2</sup>&#8239;He who walks with in&shy;teg&shy;ri&shy;ty and does what is right and speaks truth in his heart;
    <sup>3</sup>&#8239;who does not slan&shy;der with his tongue and does no e&shy;vil to his neigh&shy;bor and does not take up a re&shy;proach a&shy;gainst his friend;
    <sup>4</sup>&#8239;who des&shy;pises a vile per&shy;son but hon&shy;ors those who fear <span class="small-caps">God</span>; who keeps a prom&shy;ise e&shy;ven when it hurts and does not change;
    <sup>5</sup>&#8239;who does not loan out his mon&shy;ey with in&shy;ter&shy;est and does not take a bribe a&shy;gainst the in&shy;no&shy;cent. He who does these things shall nev&shy;er be moved.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>18:25</sup>&#8239;<span class="small-caps">God</span> shows mer&shy;cy to the mer&shy;ci&shy;ful.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>18:30</sup>&#8239;The word of <span class="small-caps">God</span> proves true. He is a shield to all who take ref&shy;uge in him.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>19:1</sup>&#8239;The heav&shy;ens de&shy;clare the glo&shy;ry of God and the skies show his hand&shy;i&shy;work.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>19:7</sup>&#8239;The law of <span class="small-caps">God</span> is per&shy;fect, re&shy;viv&shy;ing the soul. The tes&shy;ti&shy;mo&shy;ny of <span class="small-caps">God</span> is trust&shy;wor&shy;thy, mak&shy;ing wise the sim&shy;ple.
    <sup>8</sup>&#8239;The pre&shy;cepts of <span class="small-caps">God</span> are right, re&shy;joic&shy;ing the heart. The com&shy;mand&shy;ment of <span class="small-caps">God</span> is pure, enlightening the eyes.
    <sup>9</sup>&#8239;The fear of <span class="small-caps">God</span> is clean, en&shy;dur&shy;ing for ev&shy;er. The laws of <span class="small-caps">God</span> are true and right&shy;eous al&shy;to&shy;geth&shy;er.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>27:14</sup>&#8239;Wait for <span class="small-caps">God</span>. Be strong and let your heart take cour&shy;age. Wait for <span class="small-caps">God</span>.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>30:5</sup>&#8239;Weep&shy;ing may last for a night, but joy co&shy;mes in the morn&shy;ing.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>32:10</sup>&#8239;Man&shy;y sor&shy;rows come to the wick&shy;ed, but lov&shy;ing-kindness sur&shy;rounds him who trusts in <span class="small-caps">God</span>.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>33:6</sup>&#8239;By the word of <span class="small-caps">God</span> the heav&shy;ens were made and all their host by the breath of his mouth.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>34:13</sup>&#8239;Keep your tongue from e&shy;vil and your lips from speak&shy;ing de&shy;ceit.
    <sup>14</sup>&#8239;De&shy;part from e&shy;vil and do good. Seek peace and pur&shy;sue it.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>37:1</sup>&#8239;Fret not be&shy;cause of e&shy;vil&shy;do&shy;ers, and en&shy;vy not wrong&shy;do&shy;ers.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>37:7</sup>&#8239;Be still be&shy;fore <span class="small-caps">God</span> and wait pa&shy;tient&shy;ly for him. Fret not be&shy;cause of him who pros&shy;pers in his way; be&shy;cause of him who carries out wick&shy;ed schemes.
    <sup>8</sup>&#8239;Cease from an&shy;ger and for&shy;sake wrath. Fret not&mdash;it leads on&shy;ly to e&shy;vil&shy;do&shy;ing.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>37:16</sup>&#8239;A lit&shy;tle that the right&shy;eous has is bet&shy;ter than the a&shy;bun&shy;dance of man&shy;y wick&shy;ed.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>37:21</sup>&#8239;The wick&shy;ed bor&shy;rows and does not pay back, but the right&shy;eous is gen&shy;er&shy;ous and gives.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>39:1</sup>&#8239;I sa&shy;id, <q>I will guard my ways so that I may not sin with my tongue. I will muz&shy;zle my mouth while the wick&shy;ed are in my pres&shy;ence.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>41:1</sup>&#8239;Bless&shy;ed is he who con&shy;sid&shy;ers the poor. <span class="small-caps">God</span> will de&shy;liv&shy;er him in the day of trou&shy;ble.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>46:1</sup>&#8239;God is our ref&shy;uge and strength, a ver&shy;y pre&shy;sent help in trou&shy;ble.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>46:10</sup>&#8239;Be still and know that I am God.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>49:16</sup>&#8239;Do not be a&shy;fraid when one is made rich, when the splen&shy;dor of his house in&shy;creases.
    <sup>17</sup>&#8239;For when he dies he will car&shy;ry noth&shy;ing a&shy;way. His glo&shy;ry will not de&shy;scend af&shy;ter him.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>50:14</sup>&#8239;Of&shy;fer to God a sac&shy;ri&shy;fice of thanks&shy;giv&shy;ing and pay your vows to the Most High
    <sup>15</sup>&#8239;and call on me in the day of trou&shy;ble. I will de&shy;liv&shy;er you and you will glo&shy;ri&shy;fy me.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>55:22</sup>&#8239;Cast your bur&shy;den on <span class="small-caps">God</span> and he will sus&shy;tain you. He will nev&shy;er al&shy;low the right&shy;eous to be moved.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>82:3</sup>&#8239;De&shy;fend the poor and fa&shy;ther&shy;less. Do jus&shy;tice to the af&shy;flicted and des&shy;ti&shy;tute.
    <sup>4</sup>&#8239;Res&shy;cue the poor and need&shy;y. De&shy;liv&shy;er them from the hand of the wick&shy;ed.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>92:12</sup>&#8239;The right&shy;eous will flour&shy;ish like the palm tree. He will grow like a ce&shy;dar in Lebanon.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>96:2</sup>&#8239;Sing to <span class="small-caps">God</span>, bless his name. Pro&shy;claim his sal&shy;va&shy;tion from day to day.
    <sup>3</sup>&#8239;De&shy;clare his glo&shy;ry a&shy;mong the na&shy;tions, his mar&shy;vel&shy;lous deeds a&shy;mong all the peo&shy;ples.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>100:1</sup>&#8239;Make a joy&shy;ful noise to <span class="small-caps">God</span>, all the earth.
    <sup>2</sup>&#8239;Serve <span class="small-caps">God</span> with glad&shy;ness. Come be&shy;fore him with sing&shy;ing.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>102:17</sup>&#8239;<span class="small-caps">God</span> re&shy;gards the pray&shy;er of the des&shy;ti&shy;tute and does not de&shy;spise their pray&shy;er.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>103:8</sup>&#8239;<span class="small-caps">God</span> is mer&shy;ci&shy;ful and gra&shy;cious, slow to an&shy;ger, abounding in lov&shy;ing-kindness.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>105:1</sup>&#8239;Oh give thanks to <span class="small-caps">God</span>. Call on his name. Make known his deeds a&shy;mong the peo&shy;ples.
    <sup>2</sup>&#8239;Sing to him. Sing praises to him. Talk a&shy;bout all his mar&shy;vel&shy;ous deeds.
    <sup>3</sup>&#8239;Glo&shy;ry in his ho&shy;ly name. Let the hearts of those who seek <span class="small-caps">God</span> re&shy;joice.
    <sup>4</sup>&#8239;Seek <span class="small-caps">God</span> and his strength. Seek his face con&shy;tin&shy;u&shy;al&shy;ly.
    <sup>5</sup>&#8239;Re&shy;mem&shy;ber the won&shy;ders that he has done, his mir&shy;a&shy;cles and the judg&shy;ments he has pro&shy;nounced.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>106:1</sup>&#8239;Praise <span class="small-caps">God</span>. Oh give thanks to <span class="small-caps">God</span>, for he is good; for his lov&shy;ing-kindness en&shy;dures for&shy;ev&shy;er.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>111:10</sup>&#8239;The fear of <span class="small-caps">God</span> is the be&shy;gin&shy;ning of wis&shy;dom. Those who o&shy;bey his com&shy;mand&shy;ments have good un&shy;der&shy;stand&shy;ing.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>112:1</sup>&#8239;Bless&shy;ed is the man who fears <span class="small-caps">God</span>, who de&shy;lights great&shy;ly in his com&shy;mand&shy;ments.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>112:4</sup>&#8239;For the up&shy;right, light a&shy;rises in the dark&shy;ness. He is gra&shy;cious, mer&shy;ci&shy;ful and right&shy;eous.
    <sup>5</sup>&#8239;It is well with the man who deals gen&shy;er&shy;ous&shy;ly and lends, who con&shy;ducts his af&shy;fairs with jus&shy;tice.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>118:8</sup>&#8239;It is bet&shy;ter to take ref&shy;uge in <span class="small-caps">God</span> than to put con&shy;fi&shy;dence in man.
    <sup>9</sup>&#8239;It is bet&shy;ter to take ref&shy;uge in <span class="small-caps">God</span> than to put con&shy;fi&shy;dence in princes.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>122:6</sup>&#8239;Pray for the peace of Jerusalem.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>127:1</sup>&#8239;Ex&shy;cept <span class="small-caps">God</span> build the house, they la&shy;bor in vain who build it.  Ex&shy;cept <span class="small-caps">God</span> keep the cit&shy;y, the watch&shy;man stays a&shy;wake in vain.
    <sup>2</sup>&#8239;It is vain for you to rise up ear&shy;ly, to stay up late, to eat the bread of toil&mdash;for he gives sleep to his be&shy;lov&shy;ed.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>127:3</sup>&#8239;Be&shy;hold, chil&shy;dren are a her&shy;it&shy;age from <span class="small-caps">God</span> and the fruit of the womb is a re&shy;ward.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>133:1</sup>&#8239;Be&shy;hold, how good and pleas&shy;ant it is for broth&shy;ers to live to&shy;geth&shy;er in u&shy;ni&shy;ty.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>136:1</sup>&#8239;Oh give thanks to <span class="small-caps">God</span>, for he is good. His lov&shy;ing-kindness en&shy;dures for ev&shy;er.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>146:3</sup>&#8239;Do not put your trust in princes or in the son of man, who can&shy;not save.
