<p>
    <sup>1:1</sup>&#8239;I, Nephi, am mak&shy;ing a re&shy;cord of my pro&shy;ceed&shy;ings dur&shy;ing my life&shy;time.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>1:4</sup>&#8239;In the first year of the reign of Zed&shy;e&shy;ki&shy;ah king of Judah,
    <sup>18</sup>&#8239;God had shown my fa&shy;ther, Lehi, man&shy;y things a&shy;bout the de&shy;struc&shy;tion of Je&shy;ru&shy;sa&shy;lem. He went a&shy;mong the peo&shy;ple, and de&shy;clared to them what he had seen.
    <sup>20</sup>&#8239;When the peo&shy;ple heard these things, they were an&shy;gry with him, and sought his life.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:2</sup>&#8239;God com&shy;manded my fa&shy;ther in a dream that he should take his fam&shy;i&shy;ly, and de&shy;part in&shy;to the wil&shy;der&shy;ness.
    <sup>4</sup>&#8239;He left his house, land, gold, sil&shy;ver, and pre&shy;cious things, and took noth&shy;ing with him, ex&shy;cept his fam&shy;i&shy;ly, pro&shy;vi&shy;sions, and tents, and de&shy;part&shy;ed in&shy;to the wil&shy;der&shy;ness.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:11</sup>&#8239;La&shy;man and Lem&shy;uel, my old&shy;er broth&shy;ers, grumbled a&shy;gainst their fa&shy;ther, be&shy;cause he had led them out of Je&shy;ru&shy;sa&shy;lem, leav&shy;ing their land, gold, sil&shy;ver, and pre&shy;cious things. They sa&shy;id he had done this be&shy;cause of the fool&shy;ish im&shy;ag&shy;i&shy;na&shy;tions of his heart.
    <sup>13</sup>&#8239;They al&shy;so did not be&shy;lieve that Je&shy;ru&shy;sa&shy;lem could be de&shy;stroyed.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:16</sup>&#8239;I be&shy;lieved all that my fa&shy;ther had spo&shy;ken. There&shy;fore, I did not re&shy;bel a&shy;gainst him like my broth&shy;ers.
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>3:2</sup>&#8239;My fa&shy;ther sa&shy;id to me,
    <sup>3</sup>&#8239;<q>Laban has the re&shy;cord of the Jews, and it&#x02BC;s en&shy;graved on brass plates.
    <sup>4</sup>&#8239;There&shy;fore, God has com&shy;manded me that you and your broth&shy;ers should re&shy;turn to Je&shy;ru&shy;sa&shy;lem, go to Laban&#x02BC;s house, seek the rec&shy;ords, and bring them here in&shy;to the wil&shy;der&shy;ness.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>3:7</sup>&#8239;I sa&shy;id to my fa&shy;ther, <q>I&#x02BC;ll go and do what God has com&shy;manded, for I know that God gives no com&shy;mand&shy;ments un&shy;less he pre&shy;pares a way to ac&shy;com&shy;plish them.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>3:19</sup>&#8239;I sa&shy;id to my broth&shy;ers, <q>It&#x02BC;s wis&shy;dom in God that we should ob&shy;tain these rec&shy;ords, that we may pre&shy;serve for our chil&shy;dren
    <sup>20</sup>&#8239;the words spo&shy;ken by all the ho&shy;ly proph&shy;ets.</q>
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>3:23</sup>&#8239;We went up to the house of Laban.
    <sup>4:38</sup>&#8239;My broth&shy;ers and I took the brass plates, de&shy;part&shy;ed in&shy;to the wil&shy;der&shy;ness, and jour&shy;neyed to our fa&shy;ther&#x02BC;s tent.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>5:1</sup>&#8239;Af&shy;ter we had re&shy;turned to our fa&shy;ther, he was filled with joy, and al&shy;so my moth&shy;er was ver&shy;y glad.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>5:21</sup>&#8239;We had ob&shy;tained the rec&shy;ords which God had com&shy;manded us, and found that they had great val&shy;ue to us, be&shy;cause we could pre&shy;serve the com&shy;mand&shy;ments of God for our chil&shy;dren.
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>7:6</sup>&#8239;As we jour&shy;neyed in the wil&shy;der&shy;ness, La&shy;man and Lem&shy;uel
    <sup>16</sup>&#8239;were an&shy;gry with me, and tried to take a&shy;way my life,
    <sup>19</sup>&#8239;but some of our com&shy;pa&shy;ny plead with them, and they stopped try&shy;ing to take a&shy;way my life.
    <sup>21</sup>&#8239;I frank&shy;ly for&shy;gave them all that they had done, and we trav&shy;eled a&shy;gain on our jour&shy;ney.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>17:3</sup>&#8239;Thus we see that if the chil&shy;dren of men keep God&#x02BC;s com&shy;mand&shy;ments, he pro&shy;vides means for them to ac&shy;com&shy;plish the thing which he has com&shy;manded them.
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>17:5</sup>&#8239;We came to the land which we called Boun&shy;ti&shy;ful, be&shy;cause it had much fruit and wild hon&shy;ey. God had pre&shy;pared all these things that we might not per&shy;ish.
    <sup>6</sup>&#8239;We pitched our tents by the sea&shy;shore, and re&shy;joiced great&shy;ly.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>17:7</sup>&#8239;God sa&shy;id to me, Nephi,
    <sup>8</sup>&#8239;<q>You shall con&shy;struct a ship, af&shy;ter the man&shy;ner that I will show you, that I may car&shy;ry your peo&shy;ple a&shy;cross these wa&shy;ters.</q>
    <sup>15</sup>&#8239;There&shy;fore, I la&shy;bored to keep the com&shy;mand&shy;ments of God.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>17:17</sup>&#8239;When my broth&shy;ers saw that I was a&shy;bout to build a ship, they be&shy;gan to grum&shy;ble a&shy;gainst me, say&shy;ing, <q>Our broth&shy;er is a fool, for he thinks that he can build a ship, and cross these great wa&shy;ters.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>17:19</sup>&#8239;I was deep&shy;ly grieved be&shy;cause of the hard&shy;ness of their hearts. When they saw this they were glad, say&shy;ing, <q>We knew that you couldn&#x02BC;t con&shy;struct a ship, and that you lacked judg&shy;ment.
    <sup>20</sup>&#8239;You&#x02BC;re like our fa&shy;ther, led a&shy;way by the fool&shy;ish im&shy;ag&shy;i&shy;na&shy;tions of his heart. He has led us out of the land of Je&shy;ru&shy;sa&shy;lem, and we&#x02BC;ve wan&shy;dered in the wil&shy;der&shy;ness all these years.</q>
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>18:3</sup>&#8239;I, Nephi, of&shy;ten went up on the moun&shy;tain, and I of&shy;ten prayed to God.
    <sup>4</sup>&#8239;Af&shy;ter I had fin&shy;ished the ship, my broth&shy;ers saw that it was good, and they humbled them&shy;selves a&shy;gain be&shy;fore God.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>18:6</sup>&#8239;Af&shy;ter we had pre&shy;pared man&shy;y pro&shy;vi&shy;sions, we went in&shy;to the ship with our wives and our chil&shy;dren,
    <sup>8</sup>&#8239;and we put forth in&shy;to the sea.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>18:23</sup>&#8239;Af&shy;ter we had sailed for man&shy;y days we ar&shy;rived at the prom&shy;ised land.
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>19:1</sup>&#8239;I made plates of o&shy;re to en&shy;grave on them the re&shy;cord of my peo&shy;ple,
    <sup>5</sup>&#8239;to keep the more sa&shy;cred things for the in&shy;struc&shy;tion of my peo&shy;ple.
    <sup>7</sup>&#8239;The things which some men es&shy;teem to be of great worth, both to the bod&shy;y and soul, oth&shy;ers set at naught.
    <sup>9</sup>&#8239;The world, be&shy;cause of their in&shy;iq&shy;ui&shy;ty, will judge Jesus to be a thing of naught.
    <sup>18</sup>&#8239;I have writ&shy;ten these things that per&shy;haps I might per&shy;suade my peo&shy;ple to re&shy;mem&shy;ber God.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>22:23</sup>&#8239;For the time soon co&shy;mes that all churches which are built up to make a prof&shy;it, and to get pow&shy;er, and to be&shy;come pop&shy;u&shy;lar in the eyes of the world, must be brought low in the dust.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>22:31</sup>&#8239;If you are o&shy;be&shy;di&shy;ent to the com&shy;mand&shy;ments, and en&shy;dure to the end, you will be saved at the last day.
</p>


<h2 id="2-nephi">2 Nephi</h2>
<p>
    <sup>4:13</sup>&#8239;Not man&shy;y days af&shy;ter Lehi&#x02BC;s death, La&shy;man and Lem&shy;uel were an&shy;gry with me,
    <sup>5:2</sup>&#8239;so they sought to take a&shy;way my life.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>5:5</sup>&#8239;God warned me that I should de&shy;part from them, and flee in&shy;to the wil&shy;der&shy;ness a&shy;long with all those who would go with me.
    <sup>6</sup>&#8239;There&shy;fore, I took my fam&shy;i&shy;ly, and Sam, my old&shy;er broth&shy;er, and Jacob and Jo&shy;seph, my young&shy;er broth&shy;ers, and al&shy;so my sis&shy;ters, and their families. All those who went with me were those who be&shy;lieved in the warn&shy;ings and rev&shy;e&shy;la&shy;tions of God.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>5:7</sup>&#8239;We jour&shy;neyed in the wil&shy;der&shy;ness for man&shy;y days, and pitched our tents.
    <sup>10</sup>&#8239;We were care&shy;ful to keep the com&shy;mand&shy;ments of God in all things.
    <sup>11</sup>&#8239;We pros&shy;pered great&shy;ly, for we sowed seed, and reaped in a&shy;bun&shy;dance, and raised flocks, and herds, and an&shy;i&shy;mals of eve&shy;ry kind.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>5:14</sup>&#8239;I made man&shy;y swords, so that our enemies should not come up&shy;on us and de&shy;stroy us.
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>6:1</sup>&#8239;The words of Jacob, the broth&shy;er of Nephi:
</p>

<p>
    <sup>9:27</sup>&#8239;Woe to him that has all the com&shy;mand&shy;ments of God, and transgresses them, and wastes the days of his pro&shy;ba&shy;tion.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>9:28</sup>&#8239;Oh the van&shy;i&shy;ty, and fool&shy;ish&shy;ness of men! When they are learn&shy;ed they think they are wise, and they do not lis&shy;ten to God&#x02BC;s coun&shy;sel, for they set it a&shy;side, sup&shy;pos&shy;ing they know of them&shy;selves, there&shy;fore, their wis&shy;dom is fool&shy;ish&shy;ness and it does not prof&shy;it them.
    <sup>29</sup>&#8239;But to be learn&shy;ed is good if they lis&shy;ten to God&#x02BC;s coun&shy;sels.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>9:30</sup>&#8239;Woe to the rich, who de&shy;spise the poor, and per&shy;se&shy;cute the meek, and whose hearts are on their treas&shy;ures; there&shy;fore, their treas&shy;ure is their God.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>9:34</sup>&#8239;Woe to the li&shy;ar,
    <sup>35</sup>&#8239;to the mur&shy;der&shy;er who kills de&shy;lib&shy;er&shy;ate&shy;ly,
    <sup>36</sup>&#8239;and to those who com&shy;mit for&shy;ni&shy;ca&shy;tion.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>9:39</sup>&#8239;Re&shy;mem&shy;ber, the mind set on the flesh is death, and the mind set on the spir&shy;it is e&shy;ter&shy;nal life.
    <sup>45</sup>&#8239;Turn a&shy;way from your sins.
    <sup>46</sup>&#8239;Pre&shy;pare your souls for the day of judg&shy;ment.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>9:51</sup>&#8239;Do not spend mon&shy;ey on what has no val&shy;ue, nor your la&shy;bor on what can&shy;not sat&shy;is&shy;fy.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>10:23</sup>&#8239;Cheer up your hearts, and re&shy;mem&shy;ber that you are free to act for yourselves: to choose the way of ev&shy;er&shy;last&shy;ing death or the way of e&shy;ter&shy;nal life.
    <sup>24</sup>&#8239;There&shy;fore, rec&shy;on&shy;cile yourselves to the will of God, and not to the will of the flesh.
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>11:1</sup>&#8239;Jacob spoke man&shy;y more things to my peo&shy;ple, but I, Nephi, have on&shy;ly writ&shy;ten these.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>25:23</sup>&#8239;We la&shy;bor dil&shy;i&shy;gent&shy;ly to write, to per&shy;suade our chil&shy;dren, and al&shy;so our broth&shy;ers, to be&shy;lieve in Christ, and to be rec&shy;on&shy;ciled to God.
    <sup>26</sup>&#8239;We talk of Christ, we re&shy;joice in Christ, we preach of Christ, we proph&shy;e&shy;sy of Christ.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>26:21</sup>&#8239;There are man&shy;y churches built up which cause en&shy;vy, strife, and mal&shy;ice.
    <sup>22</sup>&#8239;The dev&shy;il leads them by the neck with a flax&shy;en cord un&shy;til he binds them with his strong cords for&shy;ev&shy;er.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>26:23</sup>&#8239;God does not work in dark&shy;ness.
    <sup>25</sup>&#8239;Does he say to any&shy;one, <q>De&shy;part from me?</q> No.
    <sup>26</sup>&#8239;Has he com&shy;manded any&shy;one to de&shy;part from the hous&shy;es of wor&shy;ship? No.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>26:29</sup>&#8239;He com&shy;mands that there shall be no priest&shy;crafts, which are when men preach and set them&shy;selves up as a light to the world, to make a prof&shy;it, and get praise of the world.
    <sup>30</sup>&#8239;God has for&shy;bid&shy;den this. There&shy;fore, he has com&shy;manded that all men should have love, and ex&shy;cept they have love they are noth&shy;ing.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>26:32</sup>&#8239;God has com&shy;manded men not to mur&shy;der, lie, steal, en&shy;vy, take his name in vain, have mal&shy;ice, con&shy;tend with one an&shy;oth&shy;er, or com&shy;mit for&shy;ni&shy;ca&shy;tion.
    <sup>33</sup>&#8239;None of these iniquities come from God, for he does good a&shy;mong the chil&shy;dren of men.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>28:3</sup>&#8239;One church will say to the oth&shy;er, <q>Be&shy;hold, I, I am God&#x02BC;s.</q> And the oth&shy;er churches will say, <q>I, I am God&#x02BC;s.</q> Thus will eve&shy;ry one say that has built up churches, and not to God.
    <sup>4</sup>&#8239;They will con&shy;tend with one an&shy;oth&shy;er, and their priests will con&shy;tend with one an&shy;oth&shy;er.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>28:8</sup>&#8239;Man&shy;y will say, <q>Eat, drink, and be mer&shy;ry, nev&shy;er&shy;the&shy;less fear God. He will jus&shy;ti&shy;fy in com&shy;mit&shy;ting a lit&shy;tle sin. Lie a lit&shy;tle, take ad&shy;van&shy;tage of one be&shy;cause of his words, dig a pit for your neigh&shy;bor. There is no harm in this. Do all these things, for to&shy;mor&shy;row we die. If we are guilt&shy;y, God will beat us with a few lashes, and at last we will be saved.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>28:12</sup>&#8239;Be&shy;cause of pride their churches have be&shy;come cor&shy;rupted.
    <sup>13</sup>&#8239;They rob the poor be&shy;cause of their fi&shy;ne sanc&shy;tu&shy;ar&shy;ies, and their fi&shy;ne cloth&shy;ing. They per&shy;se&shy;cute the meek and the poor in heart, be&shy;cause in their pride they have be&shy;come ar&shy;ro&shy;gant.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>28:16</sup>&#8239;Woe to those who turn a&shy;side the just for noth&shy;ing, and re&shy;vile a&shy;gainst what is good, and say that it has no worth!
    <sup>29</sup>&#8239;Woe to him who says, <q>We have re&shy;ceived the word of God, and we need no more of the word of God, for we have e&shy;nough!</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>28:30</sup>&#8239;God says, <q>To him who re&shy;ceives I will give more. From them who say, <q>We have e&shy;nough,</q> will be tak&shy;en a&shy;way what&shy;ev&shy;er they have.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>29:3</sup>&#8239;<q>Some will say, <q>We have a Bible, and there can&shy;not be any more Bible.</q>
    <sup>10</sup>&#8239;Be&shy;cause you have a Bible you don&#x02BC;t need to sup&shy;pose that it con&shy;tains all my words.
    <sup>11</sup>&#8239;For I com&shy;mand all men to write the words which I speak to them.</q>
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>30:17</sup>&#8239;There is noth&shy;ing se&shy;cret that will not be re&shy;vealed.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>32:8</sup>&#8239;Know that you must pray, for the e&shy;vil spir&shy;it teaches a man that he must not pray.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>33:10</sup>&#8239;Lis&shy;ten to these words and be&shy;lieve in Christ, for they teach all men to do good.
</p>


<h2 id="jacob">Jacob</h2>
<p>
    <sup>1:2</sup>&#8239;Nephi gave me, Jacob, a com&shy;mand&shy;ment to write a few of the most pre&shy;cious things.
    <sup>15</sup>&#8239;The peo&shy;ple be&shy;gan to grow hard in their hearts, and to in&shy;dulge some&shy;what in wick&shy;ed&shy;ness,
    <sup>17</sup>&#8239;there&shy;fore I gave them these words:
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<h2 id="alma">Al&shy;ma</h2>
<p>
    <sup>1:2</sup>&#8239;In the first year of Al&shy;ma&#x02BC;s reign in the judg&shy;ment seat, there was a man named Nehor
    <sup>3</sup>&#8239;who was preaching that eve&shy;ry priest and teach&shy;er should be&shy;come pop&shy;u&shy;lar, and should not la&shy;bor with his hands, but be sup&shy;ported by the peo&shy;ple.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>1:7</sup>&#8239;As he was preaching, Nehor be&shy;gan to con&shy;tend sharp&shy;ly with a man
    <sup>8</sup>&#8239;named Gid&shy;e&shy;on.
    <sup>9</sup>&#8239;Nehor drew his sword and killed Gid&shy;e&shy;on.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>1:10</sup>&#8239;Nehor was brought be&shy;fore Al&shy;ma, to be judged.
    <sup>12</sup>&#8239;Al&shy;ma sa&shy;id to him,
    <sup>14</sup>&#8239;<q>You are con&shy;demned to die, ac&shy;cord&shy;ing to the law.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>1:15</sup>&#8239;He suf&shy;fered a shame&shy;ful death,
    <sup>16</sup>&#8239;nev&shy;er&shy;the&shy;less, this did not stop priest&shy;craft from spreading through the land, for there were man&shy;y who loved the vain things of the world.
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>1:21</sup>&#8239;There was a strict law a&shy;mong the peo&shy;ple of the church that no one should per&shy;se&shy;cute those who did not be&shy;long to the church.
    <sup>27</sup>&#8239;And they im&shy;parted of their pos&shy;ses&shy;sions to the poor, and the need&shy;y, and the sick, and the af&shy;flicted; and they did not wear ex&shy;pen&shy;sive cloth&shy;ing, yet they were neat and come&shy;ly.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>1:29</sup>&#8239;Be&shy;cause of the stead&shy;i&shy;ness of the church they be&shy;came ver&shy;y rich, hav&shy;ing an a&shy;bun&shy;dance of eve&shy;ry&shy;thing they needed.
    <sup>30</sup>&#8239;In their pros&shy;per&shy;ous cir&shy;cum&shy;stances, they did not send a&shy;way any who were na&shy;ked, or hun&shy;gry, or sick.  They did not set their hearts on rich&shy;es, there&shy;fore they were gen&shy;er&shy;ous to all.
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>4:6</sup>&#8239;The peo&shy;ple of the church be&shy;gan to grow proud be&shy;cause of the great rich&shy;es they had ob&shy;tained by their dil&shy;i&shy;gence.  They were lifted up in their pride, for they be&shy;gan to wear ver&shy;y ex&shy;pen&shy;sive cloth&shy;ing.
    <sup>7</sup>&#8239;Now this caused Al&shy;ma much af&shy;flic&shy;tion.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>4:9</sup>&#8239;There be&shy;gan to be great con&shy;ten&shy;tions a&shy;mong the peo&shy;ple of the church. There was en&shy;vy, strife, mal&shy;ice, per&shy;se&shy;cu&shy;tion, and pride.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>4:15</sup>&#8239;Al&shy;ma, see&shy;ing the af&shy;flic&shy;tions, per&shy;se&shy;cu&shy;tions, and in&shy;e&shy;qual&shy;i&shy;ty, be&shy;gan to be ver&shy;y sorrowful.
    <sup>16</sup>&#8239;He se&shy;lected a wise man, and
    <sup>18</sup>&#8239;de&shy;liv&shy;ered the judg&shy;ment seat to him.
    <sup>19</sup>&#8239;He did this that he him&shy;self might go out a&shy;mong his peo&shy;ple to re&shy;mind them of their du&shy;ty, and to tear down all the pride, craft&shy;i&shy;ness, and con&shy;ten&shy;tion a&shy;mong them.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>4:20</sup>&#8239;And thus, Al&shy;ma de&shy;liv&shy;ered up the judg&shy;ment seat, and con&shy;fined him&shy;self whol&shy;ly to the priest&shy;hood of God.
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>5:2</sup>&#8239;This is what Al&shy;ma sa&shy;id to the peo&shy;ple of the church:
    <sup>14</sup>&#8239;<q>I ask you, have you ex&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;enced a might&shy;y change in your hearts?
    <sup>15</sup>&#8239;Do you look for&shy;ward and view this mor&shy;tal bod&shy;y raised in im&shy;mor&shy;tal&shy;i&shy;ty to stand be&shy;fore God to be judged ac&shy;cord&shy;ing to the deeds which have been done in the mor&shy;tal bod&shy;y?</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>5:17</sup>&#8239;<q>Do you im&shy;ag&shy;ine that you can lie to God in that day, and say, <q>God, our works have been right&shy;eous,</q> and that he will save you?</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>5:26</sup>&#8239;<q>If you have ex&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;enced a change of heart, can you feel so now?
    <sup>27</sup>&#8239;Have you walked, keep&shy;ing yourselves blame&shy;less be&shy;fore God? Could you say, if you were called to die at this time, that you have been sufficiently hum&shy;ble?
    <sup>28</sup>&#8239;Are your strip&shy;ped of pride? If not, you are not pre&shy;pared to meet God.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>5:30</sup>&#8239;<q>Is there one a&shy;mong you who mocks his broth&shy;er, or heaps per&shy;se&shy;cu&shy;tions on him?
    <sup>31</sup>&#8239;Woe to such a one, for he is not pre&shy;pared, and must re&shy;pent!</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>5:57</sup>&#8239;<q>All of you who de&shy;sire to fol&shy;low the voice of the good shep&shy;herd, come out from the wick&shy;ed, be sep&shy;a&shy;rate, and don&#x02BC;t tou&shy;ch their un&shy;clean things.</q>
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>6:8</sup>&#8239;Al&shy;ma de&shy;clared God&#x02BC;s word to the church which was in the val&shy;ley of Gid&shy;e&shy;on.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>7:2</sup>&#8239;<q>If I hadn&#x02BC;t giv&shy;en the judg&shy;ment seat to an&shy;oth&shy;er, to reign in my place, I could not have come at this time.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>7:15</sup>&#8239;<q>Lay a&shy;side eve&shy;ry sin which so eas&shy;i&shy;ly en&shy;tan&shy;gles you, which binds you down to de&shy;struc&shy;tion. Show God that you are will&shy;ing to re&shy;pent of your sins.

<p>
    <sup>8:1</sup>&#8239;Af&shy;ter teach&shy;ing the peo&shy;ple, Al&shy;ma re&shy;turned to his own house to rest from his la&shy;bors.

<p>
    <sup>4:18</sup>&#8239;In the six&shy;ty-second year of the reign of the judges,
    <sup>5:1</sup>&#8239;Nephi de&shy;liv&shy;ered the judg&shy;ment seat to Cezoram,
    <sup>4</sup>&#8239;for Nephi was wea&shy;ry be&shy;cause of the in&shy;iq&shy;ui&shy;ty of the peo&shy;ple. He gave up the judg&shy;ment seat to preach the word of God for the rest of his life, and his broth&shy;er Lehi al&shy;so.
    <sup>5</sup>&#8239;For they re&shy;mem&shy;bered what their fa&shy;ther Helaman had sa&shy;id to them:
</p>

<p>
    <sup>5:6</sup>&#8239;<q>My sons, de&shy;clare these words to the peo&shy;ple:
    <sup>12</sup>&#8239;Re&shy;mem&shy;ber that it is up&shy;on the rock of Christ that you must build your foun&shy;da&shy;tion; that when the dev&shy;il sends forth his might&shy;y winds, when all his hail and his might&shy;y storm beats up&shy;on you, it will have no pow&shy;er to dra&shy;g you down to the gulf of mis&shy;er&shy;y and end&shy;less woe, be&shy;cause of the rock on which you are built.</q>

<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>6:15</sup>&#8239;In the six&shy;ty-sixth year of the reign of the judges, Cezoram was mur&shy;dered.  His son, who had been ap&shy;point&shy;ed by the peo&shy;ple in his place, was al&shy;so mur&shy;dered.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>6:16</sup>&#8239;The peo&shy;ple grew ver&shy;y wick&shy;ed.
    <sup>17</sup>&#8239;For God had bless&shy;ed them so long with the rich&shy;es of the world that they be&shy;gan to set their hearts on their rich&shy;es. They be&shy;gan to seek for prof&shy;it that they might be lifted up one a&shy;bove an&shy;oth&shy;er. There&shy;fore they be&shy;gan to mur&shy;der, rob, and plun&shy;der, to get mon&shy;ey.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>6:18</sup>&#8239;Those mur&shy;der&shy;ers and plunderers were a band formed by Gadianton.
    <sup>22</sup>&#8239;They had signs, and se&shy;cret words to rec&shy;og&shy;nize a broth&shy;er who had en&shy;tered in&shy;to the cov&shy;e&shy;nant, that what&shy;ev&shy;er wick&shy;ed&shy;ness he did he should not be in&shy;jured by those who be&shy;longed to his band.
    <sup>23</sup>&#8239;Thus they might mur&shy;der, plun&shy;der, steal, and com&shy;mit for&shy;ni&shy;ca&shy;tion and all kinds of wick&shy;ed&shy;ness, con&shy;tra&shy;ry to the laws of their coun&shy;try and the laws of God.
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>7:4</sup>&#8239;Nephi saw the peo&shy;ple in a state of aw&shy;ful wick&shy;ed&shy;ness, and the Gadianton rob&shy;bers fill&shy;ing the judg&shy;ment seats, hav&shy;ing u&shy;surped the au&shy;thor&shy;i&shy;ty of the land;

</p>

<p>
    <sup>7:6</sup>&#8239;Now this great in&shy;iq&shy;ui&shy;ty had come up&shy;on the peo&shy;ple in on&shy;ly a few years.

    <sup>21</sup>&#8239;Be&shy;hold, it is to get mon&shy;ey, and to be praised of men.
    <sup>26</sup>&#8239;Woe will come to you be&shy;cause of that pride which you have al&shy;lowed to en&shy;ter your hearts, which has lifted you up be&shy;cause of your ver&shy;y great rich&shy;es!</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>8:25</sup>&#8239;<q>You have re&shy;jected the truth, and rebelled a&shy;gainst God.

    <sup>26</sup>&#8239;In on&shy;ly a few years, they be&shy;came a ver&shy;y great band of rob&shy;bers.
    <sup>32</sup>&#8239;They great&shy;ly fright&shy;ened the peo&shy;ple,
    <sup>33</sup>&#8239;for they killed man&shy;y, and car&shy;ried a&shy;way oth&shy;ers cap&shy;tive in&shy;to the wil&shy;der&shy;ness; es&shy;pe&shy;cial&shy;ly their wom&shy;en and their chil&shy;dren.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>12:1</sup>&#8239;And thus we can see the unsteadiness of the hearts of the chil&shy;dren of men.
    <sup>2</sup>&#8239;At the ver&shy;y time when God pros&shy;pers his peo&shy;ple, do&shy;ing all things for their wel&shy;fare and hap&shy;pi&shy;ness, then is the time that they hard&shy;en their hearts, and for&shy;get God, be&shy;cause of their ease, and ver&shy;y great pros&shy;per&shy;i&shy;ty.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>12:4</sup>&#8239;How fool&shy;ish, vain, and quick to do in&shy;iq&shy;ui&shy;ty, and how slow to do good, are the chil&shy;dren of men. How quick to set their hearts on the vain things of the world!
    <sup>5</sup>&#8239;How quick to be lifted up in pride; how quick to boast; and how slow to re&shy;mem&shy;ber God, and to lis&shy;ten to his guid&shy;ance. How slow to walk in wis&shy;dom&#x02BC;s paths!
</p>

<p>
    <sup>12:6</sup>&#8239;They ne&shy;glect God&#x02BC;s guid&shy;ance, and will not have him as their guide.

Your hearts swell with great pride, un&shy;to boasting, en&shy;vy, strife, mal&shy;ice, per&shy;se&shy;cu&shy;tion, mur&shy;der, and all man&shy;ner of in&shy;iq&shy;ui&shy;ty.</q>

</p>

<p>
    <sup>13:26</sup>&#8239;<q>You are worse than they. If a proph&shy;et co&shy;mes to you and de&shy;clares your sins and iniquities, you are an&shy;gry with him, and look for ways to de&shy;stroy him.

</p>

<p>
    <sup>13:27</sup>&#8239;<q>But if a man co&shy;mes to you and says, <q>Do this and there is no in&shy;iq&shy;ui&shy;ty. Walk af&shy;ter the pride of your eyes, and do what&shy;ev&shy;er your heart de&shy;sires,</q> you will say that he is a proph&shy;et.
    <sup>28</sup>&#8239;You will dress him in ex&shy;pen&shy;sive cloth&shy;ing, be&shy;cause he speaks flattering words, and he says that all is well.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>14:30</sup>&#8239;<q>Re&shy;mem&shy;ber that you are free. You are permitted to act for yourselves. God

<p>
    <sup>8:3</sup>&#8239;My fa&shy;ther was killed by our enemies, and I e&shy;ven re&shy;main a&shy;lone to write the sad tale of the de&shy;struc&shy;tion of my peo&shy;ple.  And wheth&shy;er they will slay me, I know not.
    <sup>5</sup>&#8239;All my kins&shy;folk hath been slain in bat&shy;tle, and I have not friends nor whith&shy;er to go.

    <sup>37</sup>&#8239;For ye do love mon&shy;ey, and your sub&shy;stance, and your fi&shy;ne ap&shy;par&shy;el, and the adorning of your churches, more than ye love the poor and the need&shy;y, the sick and the af&shy;flicted.

<p>
    <sup>7:1</sup>&#8239;I, Moroni, write a few of the words of my fa&shy;ther Mormon, for af&shy;ter this man&shy;ner did he speak un&shy;to the peo&shy;ple.
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>7:2</sup>&#8239;I, Mormon, speak un&shy;to you, my be&shy;lov&shy;ed breth&shy;ren.
    <sup>5</sup>&#8239;I re&shy;mem&shy;ber the word of God, which saith by their works ye shall know them; for if their works be good, then they are good al&shy;so.
    <sup>6</sup>&#8239;For God hath sa&shy;id, a man be&shy;ing e&shy;vil can&shy;not do that which is good; for if he offereth a gift, or prayeth un&shy;to God, ex&shy;cept he shall do it with re&shy;al in&shy;tent it profiteth him noth&shy;ing.
    <sup>7</sup>&#8239;For it is not counted un&shy;to him for right&shy;eous&shy;ness.
    <sup>8</sup>&#8239;For if a man be&shy;ing e&shy;vil giveth a gift, he do&shy;eth it grudg&shy;ing&shy;ly; where&shy;fore it is counted un&shy;to him the same as if he had re&shy;tained the gift; where&shy;fore he is counted e&shy;vil be&shy;fore God.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>7:9</sup>&#8239;Like&shy;wise al&shy;so is it counted e&shy;vil un&shy;to a man, if he shall pray and not with re&shy;al in&shy;tent of heart. It profiteth him noth&shy;ing, for God receiveth none such.
    <sup>10</sup>&#8239;Where&shy;fore, a man be&shy;ing e&shy;vil can&shy;not do that which is good.
    <sup>11</sup>&#8239;For be&shy;hold, a bit&shy;ter foun&shy;tain can&shy;not bring forth good wa&shy;ter; nei&shy;ther can a good foun&shy;tain bring forth bit&shy;ter wa&shy;ter.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>7:13</sup>&#8239;That which is of God inviteth and enticeth to do good con&shy;tin&shy;u&shy;al&shy;ly; where&shy;fore, eve&shy;ry thing which inviteth and enticeth to do good, and to love God, and to serve him, is in&shy;spired of God.
    <sup>14</sup>&#8239;Where&shy;fore, take heed that ye do not judge that which is e&shy;vil to be of God, or that which is good and of God to be of the dev&shy;il.
    <sup>18</sup>&#8239;See that ye do not judge wrong&shy;ful&shy;ly; for with that same judg&shy;ment which ye judge ye shall al&shy;so be judged.
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>7:44</sup>&#8239;If a man have not char&shy;i&shy;ty he is noth&shy;ing.
    <sup>45</sup>&#8239;Char&shy;i&shy;ty suffereth long, and is kind, and envieth not, and is not puffed up, seeketh not her own, is not eas&shy;i&shy;ly pro&shy;voked, thinketh no e&shy;vil, and rejoiceth not in in&shy;iq&shy;ui&shy;ty but rejoiceth in the truth, beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>7:46</sup>&#8239;Where&shy;fore, char&shy;i&shy;ty nev&shy;er faileth. Cleave un&shy;to char&shy;i&shy;ty, which is the great&shy;est of all, for all things must fail,
    <sup>47</sup>&#8239;but char&shy;i&shy;ty endureth for&shy;ev&shy;er; and who&shy;so is found pos&shy;sessed of it at the last day, it shall be well with him.
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>10:1</sup>&#8239;Now I, Moroni, write some&shy;what as seemeth me good.
    <sup>3</sup>&#8239;Be&shy;hold, I would ex&shy;hort you that when ye shall read these things, that ye would re&shy;mem&shy;ber how mer&shy;ci&shy;ful God hath been un&shy;to the chil&shy;dren of men, and pon&shy;der it in your hearts.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>10:8</sup>&#8239;I ex&shy;hort you that ye de&shy;ny not the gifts of God, for they are man&shy;y; and they come from the same God. There are dif&shy;fer&shy;ent ways that these gifts are ad&shy;min&shy;is&shy;tered;  but it is the same God who worketh all in all; and they are giv&shy;en to prof&shy;it men.
    <sup>9</sup>&#8239;To one is giv&shy;en, that he may teach the word of wis&shy;dom;
    <sup>10</sup>&#8239;And to an&shy;oth&shy;er, that he may teach the word of knowl&shy;edge.
    <sup>11</sup>&#8239;And to an&shy;oth&shy;er, ex&shy;ceed&shy;ing&shy;ly great faith; and to an&shy;oth&shy;er, the gifts of heal&shy;ing;
    <sup>12</sup>&#8239;And to an&shy;oth&shy;er, that he may work might&shy;y mir&shy;a&shy;cles;
    <sup>13</sup>&#8239;And to an&shy;oth&shy;er, that he may proph&shy;e&shy;sy con&shy;cern&shy;ing all things;
    <sup>14</sup>&#8239;And to an&shy;oth&shy;er, the be&shy;hold&shy;ing of an&shy;gels and ministering spir&shy;its;
    <sup>15</sup>&#8239;And to an&shy;oth&shy;er, all kinds of tongues;
    <sup>16</sup>&#8239;And to an&shy;oth&shy;er, the in&shy;ter&shy;pre&shy;ta&shy;tion of lan&shy;guages.
    <sup>17</sup>&#8239;And all these gifts come un&shy;to eve&shy;ry man sev&shy;er&shy;al&shy;ly, ac&shy;cord&shy;ing as he will.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>10:21</sup>&#8239;Ex&shy;cept ye have char&shy;i&shy;ty ye can in no&shy;wise be saved; nei&shy;ther can ye be saved if ye have not faith; nei&shy;ther can ye if ye have no hope.
    <sup>22</sup>&#8239;And if ye have no hope ye must needs be in de&shy;spair; and de&shy;spair com&shy;eth be&shy;cause of in&shy;iq&shy;ui&shy;ty.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>10:34</sup>&#8239;Now I bid un&shy;to all, fare&shy;well. I soon go to rest in the par&shy;a&shy;dise of God.
