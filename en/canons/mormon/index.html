    <sup>1:9</sup>&#8239;The word of the Lord was ver&shy;i&shy;fied, which he spake un&shy;to our fa&shy;thers, say&shy;ing that: <q>Inasmuch as ye will keep my com&shy;mand&shy;ments ye shall pros&shy;per in the land.</q>
</p>


<h2 id="omni">Om&shy;ni</h2>
<p>
    <sup>1:5</sup>&#8239;The more wick&shy;ed part of my peo&shy;ple were de&shy;stroyed.
    <sup>6</sup>&#8239;For God would not suf&shy;fer, af&shy;ter he had led them out of the land of Je&shy;ru&shy;sa&shy;lem and kept and pre&shy;served them from fall&shy;ing in&shy;to the hands of their enemies, yea, he would not suf&shy;fer that the words should not be ver&shy;i&shy;fied, which he spake un&shy;to our fa&shy;thers, say&shy;ing that: <q>Inasmuch as ye will not keep my com&shy;mand&shy;ments ye shall not pros&shy;per in the land.</q>
    <sup>7</sup>&#8239;Where&shy;fore, God did vis&shy;it them in great judg&shy;ment; nev&shy;er&shy;the&shy;less, he did spare the right&shy;eous that they should not per&shy;ish, but did de&shy;liv&shy;er them out of the hands of their enemies.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>1:25</sup>&#8239;There is noth&shy;ing which is good save it co&shy;mes from God; and that which is e&shy;vil com&shy;eth from the dev&shy;il.
    <sup>26</sup>&#8239;Of&shy;fer your whole souls as an of&shy;fer&shy;ing un&shy;to God, and con&shy;tin&shy;ue in fasting and praying, and en&shy;dure to the end; and as God liveth ye will be saved.
</p>


<h2 id="4-nephi">4 Nephi</h2>
<p>
    <sup>1:2</sup>&#8239;The peo&shy;ple were all con&shy;vert&shy;ed un&shy;to God, and there were no con&shy;ten&shy;tions and dis&shy;pu&shy;ta&shy;tions a&shy;mong them, and eve&shy;ry man did deal just&shy;ly one with an&shy;oth&shy;er.
    <sup>3</sup>&#8239;And they had all things com&shy;mon a&shy;mong them; there&shy;fore there were not rich and poor, bond and free, but they were all made free, and par&shy;tak&shy;ers of the heav&shy;en&shy;ly gift,
    <sup>4</sup>&#8239;and there still con&shy;tin&shy;ued to be peace in the land.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>1:15</sup>&#8239;There was no con&shy;ten&shy;tion in the land, be&shy;cause of the love of God which did dwell in the hearts of the peo&shy;ple.
    <sup>16</sup>&#8239;There were no en&shy;vy&shy;ings, nor strifes, nor tu&shy;mults, nor whore&shy;doms, nor ly&shy;ings, nor mur&shy;ders, nor an&shy;y man&shy;ner of las&shy;civ&shy;i&shy;ous&shy;ness. Sure&shy;ly there could not be a hap&shy;pi&shy;er peo&shy;ple a&shy;mong all the peo&shy;ple who had been cre&shy;at&shy;ed by the hand of God.
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>1:24</sup>&#8239;When one hun&shy;dred six&shy;ty-five years had pas&shy;sed, there be&shy;gan to be a&shy;mong them those who were lifted up in pride, such as the wear&shy;ing of cost&shy;ly ap&shy;par&shy;el, and all man&shy;ner of fi&shy;ne pearls, and of the fi&shy;ne things of the world.
    <sup>25</sup>&#8239;From that time forth, they did have their goods and their sub&shy;stance no more com&shy;mon a&shy;mong them.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>1:26</sup>&#8239;They be&shy;gan to be di&shy;vid&shy;ed in&shy;to clas&shy;ses; and they be&shy;gan to build up churches un&shy;to them&shy;selves to get gain.
    <sup>34</sup>&#8239;Thus they did dwin&shy;dle in un&shy;be&shy;lief and wick&shy;ed&shy;ness, from year to year.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>1:41</sup>&#8239;They did build up churches un&shy;to them&shy;selves, and a&shy;dorn them with all man&shy;ner of pre&shy;cious things.
    <sup>43</sup>&#8239;And al&shy;so they be&shy;gan to be proud in their hearts, be&shy;cause of their ex&shy;ceed&shy;ing rich&shy;es, and be&shy;come vain.
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>1:45</sup>&#8239;When nine&shy;ty-nine years had pas&shy;sed, the peo&shy;ple had be&shy;come ex&shy;ceed&shy;ing&shy;ly wick&shy;ed.
</p>


<h2 id="mormon">Mormon</h2>
<p>
    <sup>1:1</sup>&#8239;I, Mormon, make a re&shy;cord of the things which I have both seen and heard.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>1:2</sup>&#8239;Ammaron came un&shy;to me, (I be&shy;ing a&shy;bout ten years of age, and I be&shy;gan to be learn&shy;ed some&shy;what af&shy;ter the man&shy;ner of the learn&shy;ing of my peo&shy;ple) and Ammaron sa&shy;id un&shy;to me: <q>I per&shy;ceive that thou art a so&shy;ber child, and art quick to ob&shy;serve;
    <sup>3</sup>&#8239;There&shy;fore, when ye are a&shy;bout twen&shy;ty-four years old go to the place where I have de&shy;pos&shy;ited all the sa&shy;cred en&shy;grav&shy;ings con&shy;cern&shy;ing this peo&shy;ple.
    <sup>4</sup>&#8239;And be&shy;hold, ye shall take the en&shy;grav&shy;ings un&shy;to your&shy;self; and ye shall en&shy;grave all the things that ye have ob&shy;served con&shy;cern&shy;ing this peo&shy;ple.</q>
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>1:6</sup>&#8239;I, be&shy;ing e&shy;lev&shy;en years old, was car&shy;ried by my fa&shy;ther in&shy;to the land south&shy;ward.
    <sup>8</sup>&#8239;In this year there be&shy;gan to be a war in the land.
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>2:2</sup>&#8239;In my six&shy;teenth year I did go forth at the head of an ar&shy;my.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:10</sup>&#8239;The peo&shy;ple be&shy;gan to re&shy;pent of their in&shy;iq&shy;ui&shy;ty.
    <sup>12</sup>&#8239;When I saw their la&shy;men&shy;ta&shy;tion and their mourn&shy;ing and their sor&shy;row be&shy;fore God, my heart did be&shy;gin to re&shy;joice with&shy;in me, know&shy;ing the mercies and the long-suffering of God, there&shy;fore sup&shy;pos&shy;ing that he would be mer&shy;ci&shy;ful un&shy;to them that they would a&shy;gain be&shy;come a right&shy;eous peo&shy;ple.
    <sup>13</sup>&#8239;But be&shy;hold my joy was vain, for their sorrowing was not un&shy;to re&shy;pent&shy;ance, be&shy;cause of the good&shy;ness of God; but it was ra&shy;ther the sorrowing of the damned, be&shy;cause God would not al&shy;ways suf&shy;fer them to take hap&shy;pi&shy;ness in sin.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:18</sup>&#8239;Be&shy;hold, a con&shy;tin&shy;u&shy;al scene of wick&shy;ed&shy;ness and a&shy;bom&shy;i&shy;na&shy;tions has been be&shy;fore mine eyes ev&shy;er since I have been suf&shy;fi&shy;cient to be&shy;hold the ways of man.
    <sup>19</sup>&#8239;And wo is me be&shy;cause of their wick&shy;ed&shy;ness; for my heart has been filled with sor&shy;row be&shy;cause of their wick&shy;ed&shy;ness, all my days.
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>3:8</sup>&#8239;Our enemies did come down a&shy;gain to bat&shy;tle. And we did beat them a&shy;gain, and did slay a great num&shy;ber of them.
    <sup>9</sup>&#8239;The peo&shy;ple be&shy;gan to boast in their own strength, and be&shy;gan to swear be&shy;fore the heav&shy;ens that they would a&shy;venge them&shy;selves of the blood of their breth&shy;ren who had been slain by their enemies.
    <sup>10</sup>&#8239;They did swear by the heav&shy;ens that they would go up to bat&shy;tle a&shy;gainst their enemies, and would cut them off from the face of the land.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>3:11</sup>&#8239;I did utterly re&shy;fuse from this time forth to be a lead&shy;er of this peo&shy;ple, be&shy;cause of their wick&shy;ed&shy;ness and a&shy;bom&shy;i&shy;na&shy;tion.
    <sup>12</sup>&#8239;Not&shy;with&shy;stand&shy;ing their wick&shy;ed&shy;ness I had led them man&shy;y times to bat&shy;tle, and had loved them, ac&shy;cord&shy;ing to the love of God which was in me, with all my heart; nev&shy;er&shy;the&shy;less, it was with&shy;out faith, be&shy;cause of the hard&shy;ness of their hearts.
    <sup>13</sup>&#8239;And thrice have I de&shy;liv&shy;ered them out of the hands of their enemies, and they have re&shy;pented not of their sins.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>3:16</sup>&#8239;I utterly re&shy;fused to go up a&shy;gainst mine enemies; and I did stand as an i&shy;dle wit&shy;ness to man&shy;i&shy;fest un&shy;to the world the things which I saw and heard.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>4:5</sup>&#8239;Be&shy;hold, the judg&shy;ments of God will o&shy;ver&shy;take the wick&shy;ed; and it is by the wick&shy;ed that the wick&shy;ed are pun&shy;ished; for it is the wick&shy;ed that stir up the hearts of men un&shy;to blood&shy;shed.
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>4:9</sup>&#8239;And now there had been thou&shy;sands slain on both sides.
    <sup>11</sup>&#8239;And it is im&shy;pos&shy;si&shy;ble for the tongue to de&shy;scribe, or for man to write a per&shy;fect de&shy;scrip&shy;tion of the hor&shy;ri&shy;ble scene of the blood and car&shy;nage which was a&shy;mong the peo&shy;ple.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>4:23</sup>&#8239;And now, see&shy;ing that our enemies were a&shy;bout to o&shy;ver&shy;throw the land, there&shy;fore I did take up all the rec&shy;ords which Ammaron had hid.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>6:6</sup>&#8239;Be&shy;hold I, Mormon, be&shy;gan to be old; and know&shy;ing it to be the last strug&shy;gle of my peo&shy;ple, and hav&shy;ing been com&shy;manded of God that I should not suf&shy;fer the rec&shy;ords which had been hand&shy;ed down by our fa&shy;thers, which were sa&shy;cred, to fall in&shy;to the hands of our enemies (for they would de&shy;stroy them) there&shy;fore I hid in a hill all the rec&shy;ords which had been en&shy;trusted to me, save it were these few which I gave un&shy;to my son Moroni.
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>8:1</sup>&#8239;Be&shy;hold I, Moroni, do fin&shy;ish the re&shy;cord of my fa&shy;ther, Mormon.  I have but few things to write, which things I have been com&shy;manded by my fa&shy;ther.
    <sup>2</sup>&#8239;Af&shy;ter the great and tre&shy;men&shy;dous bat&shy;tle, be&shy;hold, those who had es&shy;caped in&shy;to the coun&shy;try south&shy;ward were hunt&shy;ed by our enemies, un&shy;til they were all de&shy;stroyed.
    <sup>3</sup>&#8239;And my fa&shy;ther al&shy;so was killed by them, and I e&shy;ven re&shy;main a&shy;lone to write the sad tale of the de&shy;struc&shy;tion of my peo&shy;ple.  And wheth&shy;er they will slay me, I know not.
    <sup>5</sup>&#8239;My fa&shy;ther hath been slain in bat&shy;tle, and all my kins&shy;folk, and I have not friends nor whith&shy;er to go; and how long God will suf&shy;fer that I may live I know not.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>8:12</sup>&#8239;Who&shy;so receiveth this re&shy;cord, and shall not con&shy;demn it be&shy;cause of the im&shy;per&shy;fec&shy;tions which are in it, the same shall know of greater things than these.
    <sup>19</sup>&#8239;For be&shy;hold, the same that judgeth rash&shy;ly shall be judged rash&shy;ly a&shy;gain; for ac&shy;cord&shy;ing to his works shall his wages be.
    <sup>20</sup>&#8239;Be&shy;hold what the scrip&shy;ture says, <q>Man shall not smite, nei&shy;ther shall he judge; for judg&shy;ment is mine, saith God, and venge&shy;ance is mine al&shy;so, and I will re&shy;pay.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>8:22</sup>&#8239;For the e&shy;ter&shy;nal pur&shy;poses of God shall roll on, un&shy;til all his prom&shy;ises shall be ful&shy;filled.
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>8:31</sup>&#8239;There shall be man&shy;y who will say, <q>Do this, or do that, and it mattereth not, for God will up&shy;hold such at the last day.</q> But wo un&shy;to such for they are in the gall of bit&shy;ter&shy;ness and in the bonds of in&shy;iq&shy;ui&shy;ty.
    <sup>32</sup>&#8239;Yea, there shall be churches built up that shall say, <q>Come un&shy;to me, and for your mon&shy;ey you shall be for&shy;giv&shy;en of your sins.</q>
    <sup>33</sup>&#8239;O ye wick&shy;ed and per&shy;verse and stiffnecked peo&shy;ple.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>8:36</sup>&#8239;And I know that ye do walk in the pride of your hearts, un&shy;to the wear&shy;ing of ver&shy;y fi&shy;ne ap&shy;par&shy;el, un&shy;to en&shy;vy&shy;ing, and strifes, and mal&shy;ice, and per&shy;se&shy;cu&shy;tions, and all man&shy;ner of iniquities.
    <sup>37</sup>&#8239;For be&shy;hold, ye do love mon&shy;ey, and your sub&shy;stance, and your fi&shy;ne ap&shy;par&shy;el, and the adorning of your churches, more than ye love the poor and the need&shy;y, the sick and the af&shy;flicted.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>8:39</sup>&#8239;Why do ye a&shy;dorn yourselves with that which hath no life, and yet suf&shy;fer the hun&shy;gry, and the need&shy;y, and the na&shy;ked, and the sick and the af&shy;flicted to pas&shy;s by you, and no&shy;tice them not?
</p>

<p>
    <sup>9:27</sup>&#8239;Doubt not, but be believing, and come un&shy;to God with all your heart, and work out your own sal&shy;va&shy;tion with fear and trembling be&shy;fore him.
    <sup>28</sup>&#8239;Be wise in the days of your pro&shy;ba&shy;tion; strip yourselves of all un&shy;clean&shy;ness; ask not, that ye may con&shy;sume it on your lusts, but ask with a firm&shy;ness un&shy;sha&shy;ken, that ye will yield to no temp&shy;ta&shy;tion, but that ye will serve the true and liv&shy;ing God.
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>9:31</sup>&#8239;Con&shy;demn me not be&shy;cause of mine im&shy;per&shy;fec&shy;tion, nei&shy;ther my fa&shy;ther, be&shy;cause of his im&shy;per&shy;fec&shy;tion, nei&shy;ther them who have writ&shy;ten be&shy;fore him; but ra&shy;ther give thanks un&shy;to God that he hath made man&shy;i&shy;fest un&shy;to you our im&shy;per&shy;fec&shy;tions, that ye may learn to be more wise than we have been.
</p>


<h2 id="moroni">Moroni</h2>
<p>
    <sup>7:1</sup>&#8239;I, Moroni, write a few of the words of my fa&shy;ther Mormon, for af&shy;ter this man&shy;ner did he speak un&shy;to the peo&shy;ple.
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>7:2</sup>&#8239;I, Mormon, speak un&shy;to you, my be&shy;lov&shy;ed breth&shy;ren.
    <sup>5</sup>&#8239;I re&shy;mem&shy;ber the word of God, which saith by their works ye shall know them; for if their works be good, then they are good al&shy;so.
    <sup>6</sup>&#8239;For be&shy;hold, God hath sa&shy;id, a man be&shy;ing e&shy;vil can&shy;not do that which is good; for if he offereth a gift, or prayeth un&shy;to God, ex&shy;cept he shall do it with re&shy;al in&shy;tent it profiteth him noth&shy;ing.
    <sup>7</sup>&#8239;For be&shy;hold, it is not counted un&shy;to him for right&shy;eous&shy;ness.
    <sup>8</sup>&#8239;For be&shy;hold, if a man be&shy;ing e&shy;vil giveth a gift, he do&shy;eth it grudg&shy;ing&shy;ly; where&shy;fore it is counted un&shy;to him the same as if he had re&shy;tained the gift; where&shy;fore he is counted e&shy;vil be&shy;fore God.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>7:9</sup>&#8239;Like&shy;wise al&shy;so is it counted e&shy;vil un&shy;to a man, if he shall pray and not with re&shy;al in&shy;tent of heart; yea, and it profiteth him noth&shy;ing, for God receiveth none such.
    <sup>10</sup>&#8239;Where&shy;fore, a man be&shy;ing e&shy;vil can&shy;not do that which is good.
    <sup>11</sup>&#8239;For be&shy;hold, a bit&shy;ter foun&shy;tain can&shy;not bring forth good wa&shy;ter; nei&shy;ther can a good foun&shy;tain bring forth bit&shy;ter wa&shy;ter.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>7:13</sup>&#8239;Be&shy;hold, that which is of God inviteth and enticeth to do good con&shy;tin&shy;u&shy;al&shy;ly; where&shy;fore, eve&shy;ry thing which inviteth and enticeth to do good, and to love God, and to serve him, is in&shy;spired of God.
    <sup>14</sup>&#8239;Where&shy;fore, take heed that ye do not judge that which is e&shy;vil to be of God, or that which is good and of God to be of the dev&shy;il.
    <sup>18</sup>&#8239;See that ye do not judge wrong&shy;ful&shy;ly; for with that same judg&shy;ment which ye judge ye shall al&shy;so be judged.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>7:23</sup>&#8239;God de&shy;clared un&shy;to proph&shy;ets that Christ should come.
    <sup>24</sup>&#8239;And be&shy;hold, there were di&shy;vers ways that he did man&shy;i&shy;fest things un&shy;to the chil&shy;dren of men, which were good.
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>7:44</sup>&#8239;If a man have not char&shy;i&shy;ty he is noth&shy;ing; where&shy;fore he must needs have char&shy;i&shy;ty.
    <sup>45</sup>&#8239;And char&shy;i&shy;ty suffereth long, and is kind, and envieth not, and is not puffed up, seeketh not her own, is not eas&shy;i&shy;ly pro&shy;voked, thinketh no e&shy;vil, and rejoiceth not in in&shy;iq&shy;ui&shy;ty but rejoiceth in the truth, beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>7:46</sup>&#8239;Where&shy;fore, my be&shy;lov&shy;ed breth&shy;ren, if ye have not char&shy;i&shy;ty, ye are noth&shy;ing, for char&shy;i&shy;ty nev&shy;er faileth. Where&shy;fore, cleave un&shy;to char&shy;i&shy;ty, which is the great&shy;est of all, for all things must fail,
    <sup>47</sup>&#8239;but char&shy;i&shy;ty endureth for&shy;ev&shy;er; and who&shy;so is found pos&shy;sessed of it at the last day, it shall be well with him.
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

    <sup>10:1</sup>&#8239;Now I, Moroni, write some&shy;what as seemeth me good.
    <sup>3</sup>&#8239;Be&shy;hold, I would ex&shy;hort you that when ye shall read these things, that ye would re&shy;mem&shy;ber how mer&shy;ci&shy;ful God hath been un&shy;to the chil&shy;dren of men, and pon&shy;der it in your hearts.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>10:8</sup>&#8239;I ex&shy;hort you, my breth&shy;ren, that ye de&shy;ny not the gifts of God, for they are man&shy;y; and they come from the same God.  And there are dif&shy;fer&shy;ent ways that these gifts are ad&shy;min&shy;is&shy;tered;  but it is the same God who worketh all in all; and they are giv&shy;en to prof&shy;it men.
    <sup>9</sup>&#8239;For be&shy;hold, to one is giv&shy;en, that he may teach the word of wis&shy;dom;
    <sup>10</sup>&#8239;And to an&shy;oth&shy;er, that he may teach the word of knowl&shy;edge.
    <sup>11</sup>&#8239;And to an&shy;oth&shy;er, ex&shy;ceed&shy;ing&shy;ly great faith; and to an&shy;oth&shy;er, the gifts of heal&shy;ing;
    <sup>12</sup>&#8239;And to an&shy;oth&shy;er, that he may work might&shy;y mir&shy;a&shy;cles;
    <sup>13</sup>&#8239;And to an&shy;oth&shy;er, that he may proph&shy;e&shy;sy con&shy;cern&shy;ing all things;
    <sup>14</sup>&#8239;And to an&shy;oth&shy;er, the be&shy;hold&shy;ing of an&shy;gels and ministering spir&shy;its;
    <sup>15</sup>&#8239;And to an&shy;oth&shy;er, all kinds of tongues;
    <sup>16</sup>&#8239;And to an&shy;oth&shy;er, the in&shy;ter&shy;pre&shy;ta&shy;tion of lan&shy;guages.
    <sup>17</sup>&#8239;And all these gifts come un&shy;to eve&shy;ry man sev&shy;er&shy;al&shy;ly, ac&shy;cord&shy;ing as he will.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>10:21</sup>&#8239;Ex&shy;cept ye have char&shy;i&shy;ty ye can in no&shy;wise be saved; nei&shy;ther can ye be saved if ye have not faith; nei&shy;ther can ye if ye have no hope.
    <sup>22</sup>&#8239;And if ye have no hope ye must needs be in de&shy;spair; and de&shy;spair com&shy;eth be&shy;cause of in&shy;iq&shy;ui&shy;ty.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>10:34</sup>&#8239;Now I bid un&shy;to all, fare&shy;well. I soon go to rest in the par&shy;a&shy;dise of God.
