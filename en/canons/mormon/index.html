<p>
    <sup>1:1</sup>&#8239;I, Nephi, am mak&shy;ing a re&shy;cord of my pro&shy;ceed&shy;ings dur&shy;ing my life&shy;time.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>1:4</sup>&#8239;In the first year of the reign of Zed&shy;e&shy;ki&shy;ah king of Judah,
    <sup>18</sup>&#8239;God had shown my fa&shy;ther, Lehi, man&shy;y things con&shy;cern&shy;ing the de&shy;struc&shy;tion of Je&shy;ru&shy;sa&shy;lem. He went a&shy;mong the peo&shy;ple, and de&shy;clared to them what he had seen.
    <sup>20</sup>&#8239;When the peo&shy;ple heard these things, they were an&shy;gry with him, and sought his life.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:2</sup>&#8239;God com&shy;manded my fa&shy;ther in a dream that he should take his fam&shy;i&shy;ly, and de&shy;part in&shy;to the wil&shy;der&shy;ness.
    <sup>4</sup>&#8239;He left his house, land, gold, sil&shy;ver, and pre&shy;cious things, and took noth&shy;ing with him, ex&shy;cept his fam&shy;i&shy;ly, pro&shy;vi&shy;sions, and tents, and de&shy;part&shy;ed in&shy;to the wil&shy;der&shy;ness.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:11</sup>&#8239;La&shy;man and Lem&shy;uel, my old&shy;er broth&shy;ers, grumbled a&shy;gainst their fa&shy;ther, be&shy;cause he had led them out of Je&shy;ru&shy;sa&shy;lem, leav&shy;ing their land, gold, sil&shy;ver, and pre&shy;cious things. They sa&shy;id he had done this be&shy;cause of the fool&shy;ish im&shy;ag&shy;i&shy;na&shy;tions of his heart.
    <sup>13</sup>&#8239;They al&shy;so did not be&shy;lieve that Je&shy;ru&shy;sa&shy;lem could be de&shy;stroyed.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:16</sup>&#8239;I be&shy;lieved all that my fa&shy;ther had spo&shy;ken. There&shy;fore, I did not re&shy;bel a&shy;gainst him like my broth&shy;ers.
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>3:2</sup>&#8239;My fa&shy;ther sa&shy;id to me,
    <sup>3</sup>&#8239;<q>Laban has the re&shy;cord of the Jews, and it&#x02BC;s en&shy;graved on brass plates.
    <sup>4</sup>&#8239;There&shy;fore, God has com&shy;manded me that you and your broth&shy;ers should re&shy;turn to Je&shy;ru&shy;sa&shy;lem, go to Laban&#x02BC;s house, seek the rec&shy;ords, and bring them here in&shy;to the wil&shy;der&shy;ness.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>3:7</sup>&#8239;I sa&shy;id to my fa&shy;ther, <q>I&#x02BC;ll go and do what God has com&shy;manded, for I know that God gives no com&shy;mand&shy;ments un&shy;less he pre&shy;pares a way to ac&shy;com&shy;plish them.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>3:19</sup>&#8239;I sa&shy;id to my broth&shy;ers, <q>It&#x02BC;s wis&shy;dom in God that we should ob&shy;tain these rec&shy;ords, that we may pre&shy;serve for our chil&shy;dren
    <sup>20</sup>&#8239;the words spo&shy;ken by all the ho&shy;ly proph&shy;ets.</q>
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>3:23</sup>&#8239;We went up to the house of Laban.
    <sup>4:38</sup>&#8239;My broth&shy;ers and I took the brass plates, de&shy;part&shy;ed in&shy;to the wil&shy;der&shy;ness, and jour&shy;neyed un&shy;to the tent of our fa&shy;ther.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>5:1</sup>&#8239;Af&shy;ter we had come down in&shy;to the wil&shy;der&shy;ness un&shy;to our fa&shy;ther, he was filled with joy, and al&shy;so my moth&shy;er was ex&shy;ceed&shy;ing&shy;ly glad.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>5:21</sup>&#8239;We had ob&shy;tained the rec&shy;ords which God had com&shy;manded us, and found that they were of great worth un&shy;to us, in&shy;so&shy;much that we could pre&shy;serve the com&shy;mand&shy;ments of God un&shy;to our chil&shy;dren.
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>7:6</sup>&#8239;As we jour&shy;neyed in the wil&shy;der&shy;ness, be&shy;hold La&shy;man and Lem&shy;uel
    <sup>16</sup>&#8239;were an&shy;gry with me, for they sought to take a&shy;way my life,
    <sup>19</sup>&#8239;but some of our com&shy;pa&shy;ny plead with them, and they did cease striving to take a&shy;way my life.
    <sup>21</sup>&#8239;I did frank&shy;ly for&shy;give them all that they had done, and we did a&shy;gain trav&shy;el on our jour&shy;ney.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>17:3</sup>&#8239;If the chil&shy;dren of men keep the com&shy;mand&shy;ments of God, he doth pro&shy;vide means where&shy;by they can ac&shy;com&shy;plish the thing which he has com&shy;manded them; where&shy;fore, he did pro&shy;vide means for us while we did so&shy;journ in the wil&shy;der&shy;ness.
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>17:5</sup>&#8239;We did come to the land which we called Boun&shy;ti&shy;ful, be&shy;cause of its much fruit and wild hon&shy;ey; and all these things were pre&shy;pared of God that we might not per&shy;ish.
    <sup>6</sup>&#8239;We did pitch our tents by the sea&shy;shore, and were ex&shy;ceed&shy;ing&shy;ly re&shy;joiced when we came to the sea&shy;shore.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>17:7</sup>&#8239;The voice of God came un&shy;to me, Nephi, say&shy;ing,
    <sup>8</sup>&#8239;<q>Thou shalt con&shy;struct a ship, af&shy;ter the man&shy;ner which I shall show thee, that I may car&shy;ry thy peo&shy;ple a&shy;cross these wa&shy;ters.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>17:15</sup>&#8239;Where&shy;fore, I, Nephi, did strive to keep the com&shy;mand&shy;ments of God.
    <sup>17</sup>&#8239;And when my breth&shy;ren saw that I was a&shy;bout to build a ship, they be&shy;gan to mur&shy;mur a&shy;gainst me, say&shy;ing, <q>Our broth&shy;er is a fool, for he thinketh that he can build a ship, and cross these great wa&shy;ters.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>17:19</sup>&#8239;I was ex&shy;ceed&shy;ing&shy;ly sorrowful be&shy;cause of the hard&shy;ness of their hearts. When they saw that I be&shy;gan to be sorrowful they were glad, say&shy;ing, <q>We knew that ye could not con&shy;struct a ship, and were lack&shy;ing in judg&shy;ment.
    <sup>20</sup>&#8239;Thou art like our fa&shy;ther, led a&shy;way by the fool&shy;ish im&shy;ag&shy;i&shy;na&shy;tions of his heart. He hath led us out of the land of Je&shy;ru&shy;sa&shy;lem, and we have wan&shy;dered in the wil&shy;der&shy;ness for these man&shy;y years.</q>
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>18:3</sup>&#8239;I, Nephi, did go in&shy;to the mount oft, and I did pray oft un&shy;to God.
    <sup>4</sup>&#8239;Af&shy;ter I had fin&shy;ished the ship, my breth&shy;ren be&shy;held that it was good, and they did hum&shy;ble them&shy;selves a&shy;gain be&shy;fore God.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>18:6</sup>&#8239;Af&shy;ter we had pre&shy;pared much pro&shy;vi&shy;sions, we did go down in&shy;to the ship with our wives and our chil&shy;dren,
    <sup>8</sup>&#8239;and we did put forth in&shy;to the sea.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>18:23</sup>&#8239;Af&shy;ter we had sailed for man&shy;y days we did ar&shy;rive at the prom&shy;ised land.
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>19:1</sup>&#8239;I did make plates of o&shy;re that I might engraven up&shy;on them the re&shy;cord of my peo&shy;ple.
    <sup>5</sup>&#8239;This I do that the more sa&shy;cred things may be kept for the knowl&shy;edge of my peo&shy;ple.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>19:7</sup>&#8239;The things which some men es&shy;teem to be of great worth, both to the bod&shy;y and soul, oth&shy;ers set at naught.
    <sup>9</sup>&#8239;The world, be&shy;cause of their in&shy;iq&shy;ui&shy;ty, shall judge Jesus to be a thing of naught.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>19:18</sup>&#8239;I have writ&shy;ten these things that per&shy;haps I might per&shy;suade my peo&shy;ple to re&shy;mem&shy;ber God.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>22:23</sup>&#8239;For the time speed&shy;i&shy;ly shall come that all churches which are built up to get gain, and all those who are built up to get pow&shy;er, and those who are built up to be&shy;come pop&shy;u&shy;lar in the eyes of the world, must be brought low in the dust.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>22:31</sup>&#8239;If ye shall be o&shy;be&shy;di&shy;ent to the com&shy;mand&shy;ments, and en&shy;dure to the end, ye shall be saved at the last day.
</p>


<h2 id="2-nephi">2 Nephi</h2>
<p>
    <sup>4:13</sup>&#8239;Not man&shy;y days af&shy;ter Lehi&#x02BC;s death, La&shy;man and Lem&shy;uel were an&shy;gry with me
    <sup>5:2</sup>&#8239;in&shy;so&shy;much that they did seek to take a&shy;way my life.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>5:5</sup>&#8239;God did warn me that I should de&shy;part from them and flee in&shy;to the wil&shy;der&shy;ness, and all those who would go with me.
    <sup>6</sup>&#8239;Where&shy;fore, I did take my fam&shy;i&shy;ly, and Sam, mine el&shy;der broth&shy;er, and Jacob and Jo&shy;seph, my young&shy;er breth&shy;ren, and al&shy;so my sis&shy;ters, and their families. All those who would go with me were those who be&shy;lieved in the warn&shy;ings and the rev&shy;e&shy;la&shy;tions of God.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>5:7</sup>&#8239;We did jour&shy;ney in the wil&shy;der&shy;ness for man&shy;y days, and we did pitch our tents.
    <sup>10</sup>&#8239;We did ob&shy;serve to keep the com&shy;mand&shy;ments of God in all things.
    <sup>11</sup>&#8239;And we did pros&shy;per ex&shy;ceed&shy;ing&shy;ly, for we did sow seed, and reap in a&shy;bun&shy;dance, and raise flocks, and herds, and an&shy;i&shy;mals of eve&shy;ry kind.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>5:14</sup>&#8239;I did make man&shy;y swords, lest by an&shy;y means our enemies should come up&shy;on us and de&shy;stroy us.
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>6:1</sup>&#8239;The words of Jacob, the broth&shy;er of Nephi:
</p>

<p>
    <sup>9:27</sup>&#8239;Wo un&shy;to him that has all the com&shy;mand&shy;ments of God, and that transgresseth them, and that wasteth the days of his pro&shy;ba&shy;tion.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>9:28</sup>&#8239;O the vainness, and the fool&shy;ish&shy;ness of men! When they are learn&shy;ed they think they are wise, and they heark&shy;en not un&shy;to the coun&shy;sel of God, for they set it a&shy;side, sup&shy;pos&shy;ing they know of them&shy;selves, where&shy;fore, their wis&shy;dom is fool&shy;ish&shy;ness and it profiteth them not.
    <sup>29</sup>&#8239;But to be learn&shy;ed is good if they heark&shy;en un&shy;to the coun&shy;sels of God.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>9:30</sup>&#8239;Wo un&shy;to the rich, who de&shy;spise the poor, and per&shy;se&shy;cute the meek, and their hearts are up&shy;on their treas&shy;ures; where&shy;fore, their treas&shy;ure is their God.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>9:34</sup>&#8239;Wo un&shy;to the li&shy;ar.
    <sup>35</sup>&#8239;Wo un&shy;to the mur&shy;der&shy;er who de&shy;lib&shy;er&shy;ate&shy;ly killeth.
    <sup>36</sup>&#8239;Wo un&shy;to them who com&shy;mit whore&shy;doms.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>9:39</sup>&#8239;Re&shy;mem&shy;ber, to be car&shy;nal&shy;ly-minded is death, and to be spiritually-minded is life e&shy;ter&shy;nal.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>9:45</sup>&#8239;Turn a&shy;way from your sins.
    <sup>46</sup>&#8239;Pre&shy;pare your souls for the day of judg&shy;ment.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>9:51</sup>&#8239;Do not spend mon&shy;ey for that which is of no worth, nor your la&shy;bor for that which can&shy;not sat&shy;is&shy;fy.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>10:23</sup>&#8239;Cheer up your hearts, and re&shy;mem&shy;ber that ye are free to act for yourselves: to choose the way of ev&shy;er&shy;last&shy;ing death or the way of e&shy;ter&shy;nal life.
    <sup>24</sup>&#8239;Where&shy;fore, rec&shy;on&shy;cile yourselves to the will of God, and not to the will of the flesh.
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>11:1</sup>&#8239;Jacob spake man&shy;y more things to my peo&shy;ple. Nev&shy;er&shy;the&shy;less, on&shy;ly these things have I, Nephi, writ&shy;ten.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>25:23</sup>&#8239;We la&shy;bor dil&shy;i&shy;gent&shy;ly to write, to per&shy;suade our chil&shy;dren, and al&shy;so our breth&shy;ren, to be&shy;lieve in Christ, and to be rec&shy;on&shy;ciled to God.
    <sup>26</sup>&#8239;And we talk of Christ, we re&shy;joice in Christ, we preach of Christ, we proph&shy;e&shy;sy of Christ.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>26:21</sup>&#8239;There are man&shy;y churches built up which cause en&shy;vy&shy;ings, and strifes, and mal&shy;ice.
    <sup>22</sup>&#8239;The dev&shy;il leadeth them by the neck with a flax&shy;en cord, un&shy;til he bindeth them with his strong cords for&shy;ev&shy;er.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>26:23</sup>&#8239;God worketh not in dark&shy;ness.
    <sup>25</sup>&#8239;Doth he cry un&shy;to an&shy;y, say&shy;ing, <q>De&shy;part from me?</q> I say un&shy;to you, Nay.
    <sup>26</sup>&#8239;Hath he com&shy;manded an&shy;y that they should de&shy;part out of the hous&shy;es of wor&shy;ship? Be&shy;hold, I say un&shy;to you, Nay.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>26:29</sup>&#8239;He commandeth that there shall be no priest&shy;crafts. For priest&shy;crafts are that men set them&shy;selves up for a light un&shy;to the world, that they may get gain and praise of the world.
    <sup>30</sup>&#8239;God hath for&shy;bid&shy;den this thing. Where&shy;fore, God hath giv&shy;en a com&shy;mand&shy;ment that all men should have char&shy;i&shy;ty, which char&shy;i&shy;ty is love, and ex&shy;cept they should have char&shy;i&shy;ty they were noth&shy;ing.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>26:32</sup>&#8239;God hath com&shy;manded that men should not mur&shy;der, lie, steal, take his name in vain, en&shy;vy, have mal&shy;ice, con&shy;tend one with an&shy;oth&shy;er, or com&shy;mit whore&shy;doms.
    <sup>33</sup>&#8239;For none of these iniquities come of God, for he do&shy;eth that which is good a&shy;mong the chil&shy;dren of men.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>28:3</sup>&#8239;The churches which are built up, and not un&shy;to God, the one shall say un&shy;to the oth&shy;er, <q>Be&shy;hold, I, I am God&#x02BC;s.</q> And the oth&shy;ers shall say, <q>I, I am God&#x02BC;s.</q> Thus shall eve&shy;ry one say that hath built up churches, and not un&shy;to God.
    <sup>4</sup>&#8239;They shall con&shy;tend one with an&shy;oth&shy;er, and their priests shall con&shy;tend one with an&shy;oth&shy;er.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>28:8</sup>&#8239;There shall be man&shy;y which shall say, <q>Eat, drink, and be mer&shy;ry, nev&shy;er&shy;the&shy;less fear God. He will jus&shy;ti&shy;fy in com&shy;mit&shy;ting a lit&shy;tle sin. Yea, lie a lit&shy;tle, take the ad&shy;van&shy;tage of one be&shy;cause of his words, dig a pit for thy neigh&shy;bor. There is no harm in this. Do all these things, for to&shy;mor&shy;row we die. If it so be that we are guilt&shy;y, God will beat us with a few stripes, and at last we shall be saved.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>28:12</sup>&#8239;Be&shy;cause of pride their churches have be&shy;come cor&shy;rupted.
    <sup>13</sup>&#8239;They rob the poor be&shy;cause of their fi&shy;ne sanc&shy;tu&shy;ar&shy;ies, and their fi&shy;ne cloth&shy;ing. They per&shy;se&shy;cute the meek and the poor in heart, be&shy;cause in their pride they are puffed up.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>28:16</sup>&#8239;Wo un&shy;to them that turn a&shy;side the just for a thing of naught, and re&shy;vile a&shy;gainst that which is good, and say that it is of no worth!
    <sup>29</sup>&#8239;Wo un&shy;to him that shall say, <q>We have re&shy;ceived the word of God, and we need no more of the word of God, for we have e&shy;nough!</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>28:30</sup>&#8239;For be&shy;hold, thus saith God, <q>Un&shy;to him that receiveth I will give more. From them that shall say, <q>We have e&shy;nough,</q> from them shall be tak&shy;en a&shy;way e&shy;ven that which they have.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>29:3</sup>&#8239;<q>Some shall say, <q>We have got a Bible, and there can&shy;not be an&shy;y more Bible.</q>
    <sup>10</sup>&#8239;Be&shy;cause that ye have a Bible ye need not sup&shy;pose that it con&shy;tains all my words.
    <sup>11</sup>&#8239;For I com&shy;mand all men, both in the east and in the west, and in the north, and in the south, and in the is&shy;lands of the sea, that they shall write the words which I speak un&shy;to them.</q>
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>2:12</sup>&#8239;Man&shy;y of you have be&shy;gun to search for gold, and for sil&shy;ver, and for all man&shy;ner of pre&shy;cious o&shy;res.
    <sup>13</sup>&#8239;And the hand of prov&shy;i&shy;dence hath smiled up&shy;on you most pleas&shy;ing&shy;ly, that you have ob&shy;tained man&shy;y rich&shy;es; and be&shy;cause some of you have ob&shy;tained more a&shy;bun&shy;dant&shy;ly than your breth&shy;ren ye are lifted up in the pride of your hearts be&shy;cause of the cost&shy;li&shy;ness of your ap&shy;par&shy;el, and per&shy;se&shy;cute your breth&shy;ren be&shy;cause ye sup&shy;pose that ye are bet&shy;ter than they. 
    <sup>14</sup>&#8239;Do ye sup&shy;pose that God justifieth you in this thing? Be&shy;hold, I say un&shy;to you, Nay. But he condemneth you, and if ye per&shy;sist in these things his judg&shy;ments must speed&shy;i&shy;ly come un&shy;to you.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:17</sup>&#8239;Think of your breth&shy;ren like un&shy;to yourselves, and be fa&shy;mil&shy;i&shy;ar with all and free with your sub&shy;stance, that they may be rich like un&shy;to you.

<p>
    <sup>1:2</sup>&#8239;In the first year of the reign of Al&shy;ma in the judg&shy;ment seat, there was a man named Nehor
    <sup>3</sup>&#8239;who was preaching that eve&shy;ry priest and teach&shy;er ought to be&shy;come pop&shy;u&shy;lar; and they ought not to la&shy;bor with their hands, but that they ought to be sup&shy;ported by the peo&shy;ple.

<p>
    <sup>1:7</sup>&#8239;As he was preaching, Nehor be&shy;gan to con&shy;tend sharp&shy;ly with a man.
    <sup>8</sup>&#8239;Now his name was Gid&shy;e&shy;on.
    <sup>9</sup>&#8239;Nehor drew his sword and slew Gid&shy;e&shy;on.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>1:10</sup>&#8239;Nehor was brought be&shy;fore Al&shy;ma, to be judged.

    <sup>15</sup>&#8239;He suf&shy;fered an ig&shy;no&shy;min&shy;i&shy;ous death,
    <sup>16</sup>&#8239;nev&shy;er&shy;the&shy;less, this did not end the spreading of priest&shy;craft through the land; for there were man&shy;y who loved the vain things of the world.
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>1:21</sup>&#8239;Now there was a strict law a&shy;mong the peo&shy;ple of the church that there should not an&shy;y man per&shy;se&shy;cute those that did not be&shy;long to the church.
    <sup>27</sup>&#8239;And they did im&shy;part of their sub&shy;stance to the poor, and the need&shy;y, and the sick, and the af&shy;flicted; and they did not wear cost&shy;ly ap&shy;par&shy;el, yet they were neat and come&shy;ly.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>1:29</sup>&#8239;Be&shy;cause of the stead&shy;i&shy;ness of the church they be&shy;gan to be ex&shy;ceed&shy;ing&shy;ly rich, hav&shy;ing a&shy;bun&shy;dance of all things what&shy;so&shy;ev&shy;er they stood in need.
    <sup>30</sup>&#8239;Thus, in their pros&shy;per&shy;ous cir&shy;cum&shy;stances, they did not send a&shy;way an&shy;y who were na&shy;ked, or that were hun&shy;gry, or that were sick.  They did not set their hearts up&shy;on rich&shy;es;  there&shy;fore they were lib&shy;er&shy;al to all.
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>4:6</sup>&#8239;In the eighth year of the reign of the judges, the peo&shy;ple of the church be&shy;gan to wax proud, be&shy;cause of their ex&shy;ceed&shy;ing rich&shy;es which they had ob&shy;tained by their in&shy;dus&shy;try; and they were lifted up in the pride of their eyes, for they be&shy;gan to wear ver&shy;y cost&shy;ly ap&shy;par&shy;el.
    <sup>7</sup>&#8239;Now this caused Al&shy;ma much af&shy;flic&shy;tion.

<p>
    <sup>4:9</sup>&#8239;There be&shy;gan to be great con&shy;ten&shy;tions a&shy;mong the peo&shy;ple of the church; yea, there were en&shy;vy&shy;ings, and strife, and mal&shy;ice, and per&shy;se&shy;cu&shy;tions, and pride.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>4:15</sup>&#8239;Al&shy;ma, see&shy;ing all their in&shy;e&shy;qual&shy;i&shy;ty, be&shy;gan to be ver&shy;y sorrowful.
    <sup>16</sup>&#8239;He se&shy;lected a wise man,
    <sup>17</sup>&#8239;whose name was Nephihah, and
    <sup>18</sup>&#8239;Al&shy;ma de&shy;liv&shy;ered the judg&shy;ment seat un&shy;to him.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>4:19</sup>&#8239;This he did that he him&shy;self might go forth a&shy;mong his peo&shy;ple to stir them up in re&shy;mem&shy;brance of their du&shy;ty, and that he might pull down all the pride and craft&shy;i&shy;ness and con&shy;ten&shy;tions which were a&shy;mong his peo&shy;ple.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>4:20</sup>&#8239;And thus in the ninth year of the reign of the judges, Al&shy;ma de&shy;liv&shy;ered up the judg&shy;ment seat, and con&shy;fined him&shy;self whol&shy;ly to the priest&shy;hood of God.

</p>

<p>
    <sup>5:17</sup>&#8239;<q>Do ye im&shy;ag&shy;ine that ye can lie un&shy;to God in that day, and say, <q>God, our works have been right&shy;eous works,</q> and that he will save you?</q>

    <sup>45</sup>&#8239;Char&shy;i&shy;ty suffereth long, and is kind, and envieth not, and is not puffed up, seeketh not her own, is not eas&shy;i&shy;ly pro&shy;voked, thinketh no e&shy;vil, and rejoiceth not in in&shy;iq&shy;ui&shy;ty but rejoiceth in the truth, beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>7:46</sup>&#8239;Where&shy;fore, char&shy;i&shy;ty nev&shy;er faileth. Cleave un&shy;to char&shy;i&shy;ty, which is the great&shy;est of all, for all things must fail,
    <sup>47</sup>&#8239;but char&shy;i&shy;ty endureth for&shy;ev&shy;er; and who&shy;so is found pos&shy;sessed of it at the last day, it shall be well with him.

    <sup>10:1</sup>&#8239;Now I, Moroni, write some&shy;what as seemeth me good.
    <sup>3</sup>&#8239;Be&shy;hold, I would ex&shy;hort you that when ye shall read these things, that ye would re&shy;mem&shy;ber how mer&shy;ci&shy;ful God hath been un&shy;to the chil&shy;dren of men, and pon&shy;der it in your hearts.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>10:8</sup>&#8239;I ex&shy;hort you that ye de&shy;ny not the gifts of God, for they are man&shy;y; and they come from the same God. There are dif&shy;fer&shy;ent ways that these gifts are ad&shy;min&shy;is&shy;tered;  but it is the same God who worketh all in all; and they are giv&shy;en to prof&shy;it men.
    <sup>9</sup>&#8239;To one is giv&shy;en, that he may teach the word of wis&shy;dom;
    <sup>10</sup>&#8239;And to an&shy;oth&shy;er, that he may teach the word of knowl&shy;edge.
    <sup>11</sup>&#8239;And to an&shy;oth&shy;er, ex&shy;ceed&shy;ing&shy;ly great faith; and to an&shy;oth&shy;er, the gifts of heal&shy;ing;
    <sup>12</sup>&#8239;And to an&shy;oth&shy;er, that he may work might&shy;y mir&shy;a&shy;cles;
    <sup>13</sup>&#8239;And to an&shy;oth&shy;er, that he may proph&shy;e&shy;sy con&shy;cern&shy;ing all things;
    <sup>14</sup>&#8239;And to an&shy;oth&shy;er, the be&shy;hold&shy;ing of an&shy;gels and ministering spir&shy;its;
    <sup>15</sup>&#8239;And to an&shy;oth&shy;er, all kinds of tongues;
    <sup>16</sup>&#8239;And to an&shy;oth&shy;er, the in&shy;ter&shy;pre&shy;ta&shy;tion of lan&shy;guages.
    <sup>17</sup>&#8239;And all these gifts come un&shy;to eve&shy;ry man sev&shy;er&shy;al&shy;ly, ac&shy;cord&shy;ing as he will.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>10:21</sup>&#8239;Ex&shy;cept ye have char&shy;i&shy;ty ye can in no&shy;wise be saved; nei&shy;ther can ye be saved if ye have not faith; nei&shy;ther can ye if ye have no hope.
    <sup>22</sup>&#8239;And if ye have no hope ye must needs be in de&shy;spair; and de&shy;spair com&shy;eth be&shy;cause of in&shy;iq&shy;ui&shy;ty.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>10:34</sup>&#8239;Now I bid un&shy;to all, fare&shy;well. I soon go to rest in the par&shy;a&shy;dise of God.
