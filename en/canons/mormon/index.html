    <sup>1:2</sup>&#8239;Nephi gave me, Jacob, a com&shy;mand&shy;ment that I should write a few of the things which I con&shy;sid&shy;er to be most pre&shy;cious.
    <sup>4</sup>&#8239;And if there were preaching which was sa&shy;cred, or rev&shy;e&shy;la&shy;tion which was great, or prophesying, that I should write the heads of them.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>1:15</sup>&#8239;And now the peo&shy;ple be&shy;gan to grow hard in their hearts, and in&shy;dulge them&shy;selves some&shy;what in wick&shy;ed prac&shy;tices, such as de&shy;sir&shy;ing man&shy;y wives and con&shy;cu&shy;bines.
    <sup>16</sup>&#8239;Yea, and they al&shy;so be&shy;gan to search much gold and sil&shy;ver, and be&shy;gan to be lifted up some&shy;what in pride.
    <sup>17</sup>&#8239;Where&shy;fore I, Jacob, gave un&shy;to them these words.
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>2:3</sup>&#8239;I this day am weighed down with much more de&shy;sire and anx&shy;i&shy;e&shy;ty for the wel&shy;fare of your souls than I have hith&shy;er&shy;to been.
    <sup>4</sup>&#8239;For be&shy;hold, as yet, ye have been o&shy;be&shy;di&shy;ent un&shy;to the word of God, which I have giv&shy;en un&shy;to you.
    <sup>5</sup>&#8239;But be&shy;hold, heark&shy;en ye un&shy;to me, and know that I can tell that ye are be&shy;gin&shy;ning to la&shy;bor in sin, which sin appeareth ver&shy;y a&shy;bom&shy;i&shy;na&shy;ble un&shy;to me, yea, and a&shy;bom&shy;i&shy;na&shy;ble un&shy;to God.
    <sup>7</sup>&#8239;And al&shy;so it grieveth me that I must use so much bold&shy;ness of speech con&shy;cern&shy;ing you, be&shy;fore your wives and your chil&shy;dren, man&shy;y of whose feel&shy;ings are ex&shy;ceed&shy;ing&shy;ly ten&shy;der and chaste and del&shy;i&shy;cate.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:12</sup>&#8239;Man&shy;y of you have be&shy;gun to search for gold, and for sil&shy;ver, and for all man&shy;ner of pre&shy;cious o&shy;res, in the which this land doth a&shy;bound most plen&shy;ti&shy;ful&shy;ly.
    <sup>13</sup>&#8239;And the hand of prov&shy;i&shy;dence hath smiled up&shy;on you most pleas&shy;ing&shy;ly, that you have ob&shy;tained man&shy;y rich&shy;es; and be&shy;cause some of you have ob&shy;tained more a&shy;bun&shy;dant&shy;ly than that of your breth&shy;ren ye are lifted up in the pride of your hearts be&shy;cause of the cost&shy;li&shy;ness of your ap&shy;par&shy;el, and per&shy;se&shy;cute your breth&shy;ren be&shy;cause ye sup&shy;pose that ye are bet&shy;ter than they.
    <sup>14</sup>&#8239;And now, my breth&shy;ren, do ye sup&shy;pose that God justifieth you in this thing? Be&shy;hold, I say un&shy;to you, Nay. But he condemneth you, and if ye per&shy;sist in these things his judg&shy;ments must speed&shy;i&shy;ly come un&shy;to you.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:17</sup>&#8239;Think of your breth&shy;ren like un&shy;to yourselves, and be fa&shy;mil&shy;i&shy;ar with all and free with your sub&shy;stance, that they may be rich like un&shy;to you.
    <sup>18</sup>&#8239;But be&shy;fore ye seek for rich&shy;es, seek ye for the king&shy;dom of God.
    <sup>19</sup>&#8239;And af&shy;ter ye have ob&shy;tained a hope in Christ ye shall ob&shy;tain rich&shy;es, if ye seek them; and ye will seek them for the in&shy;tent to do good &mdash; to clothe the na&shy;ked, and to feed the hun&shy;gry, and to lib&shy;er&shy;ate the cap&shy;tive, and ad&shy;min&shy;is&shy;ter re&shy;lief to the sick and the af&shy;flicted.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:20</sup>&#8239;And now, my breth&shy;ren, I have spo&shy;ken un&shy;to you con&shy;cern&shy;ing pride; and those of you which have af&shy;flicted your neigh&shy;bor, and per&shy;se&shy;cut&shy;ed him be&shy;cause ye were proud in your hearts of the things which God hath giv&shy;en you, what say ye of it?
    <sup>21</sup>&#8239;Do ye not sup&shy;pose that such things are a&shy;bom&shy;i&shy;na&shy;ble un&shy;to him who cre&shy;at&shy;ed all flesh? And the one be&shy;ing is as pre&shy;cious in his sight as the oth&shy;er.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:22</sup>&#8239;And now I make an end of speak&shy;ing un&shy;to you con&shy;cern&shy;ing this pride. And I must speak un&shy;to you con&shy;cern&shy;ing a grosser crime.
    <sup>23</sup>&#8239;For be&shy;hold, thus saith God: <q>This peo&shy;ple be&shy;gin to wax in in&shy;iq&shy;ui&shy;ty; they un&shy;der&shy;stand not the scrip&shy;tures, for they seek to ex&shy;cuse them&shy;selves in com&shy;mit&shy;ting whore&shy;doms, be&shy;cause of the things which were writ&shy;ten con&shy;cern&shy;ing David, and Solomon his son.
    <sup>24</sup>&#8239;Be&shy;hold, David and Solomon tru&shy;ly had man&shy;y wives and con&shy;cu&shy;bines, which thing was a&shy;bom&shy;i&shy;na&shy;ble be&shy;fore me.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:27</sup>&#8239;Where&shy;fore, my breth&shy;ren, hear me, and heark&shy;en to the word of God: <q>For there shall not an&shy;y man a&shy;mong you have save it be one wife; and con&shy;cu&shy;bines he shall have none;
    <sup>28</sup>&#8239;For I, the Lord God, de&shy;light in the chas&shy;ti&shy;ty of wom&shy;en. And whore&shy;doms are an a&shy;bom&shy;i&shy;na&shy;tion be&shy;fore me.
    <sup>30</sup>&#8239;For if I will raise up seed un&shy;to me, I will com&shy;mand my peo&shy;ple; oth&shy;er&shy;wise they shall heark&shy;en un&shy;to these things.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:31</sup>&#8239;<q>For be&shy;hold, I, God, have seen the sor&shy;row, and heard the mourn&shy;ing of the daugh&shy;ters of my peo&shy;ple be&shy;cause of the wick&shy;ed&shy;ness and a&shy;bom&shy;i&shy;na&shy;tions of their hus&shy;bands.
    <sup>32</sup>&#8239;And I will not suf&shy;fer that the cries of the fair daugh&shy;ters of this peo&shy;ple shall come up un&shy;to me a&shy;gainst the men of my peo&shy;ple,
    <sup>33</sup>&#8239;for they shall not com&shy;mit whore&shy;doms, like un&shy;to them of old.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:35</sup>&#8239;Ye have bro&shy;ken the hearts of your ten&shy;der wives, and lost the con&shy;fi&shy;dence of your chil&shy;dren, be&shy;cause of your bad ex&shy;am&shy;ples be&shy;fore them; and the sob&shy;bings of their hearts as&shy;cend up to God a&shy;gainst you.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>3:1</sup>&#8239;But be&shy;hold, I, Jacob, would speak un&shy;to you that are pure in heart. Look un&shy;to God with firm&shy;ness of mind, and pray un&shy;to him with ex&shy;ceed&shy;ing faith, and he will con&shy;sole you in your af&shy;flic&shy;tions.
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>4:8</sup>&#8239;Be&shy;hold, great and mar&shy;vel&shy;ous are the works of God. How un&shy;search&shy;a&shy;ble are the depths of the mys&shy;ter&shy;ies of him; and it is im&shy;pos&shy;si&shy;ble that man should find out all his ways. And no man knoweth of his ways save it be re&shy;vealed un&shy;to him; where&shy;fore, breth&shy;ren, de&shy;spise not the rev&shy;e&shy;la&shy;tions of God.
    <sup>10</sup>&#8239;Where&shy;fore, breth&shy;ren, seek not to coun&shy;sel God, but to take coun&shy;sel from his hand. For be&shy;hold, ye yourselves know that he counseleth in wis&shy;dom, and in jus&shy;tice, and in great mer&shy;cy, o&shy;ver all his works.
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>6:12</sup>&#8239;O be wise; what can I say more?
    <sup>13</sup>&#8239;Fi&shy;nal&shy;ly, I bid you fare&shy;well, un&shy;til I shall meet you be&shy;fore the pleas&shy;ing ba&shy;r of God.  A&shy;men.
    <sup>7:27</sup>&#8239;And I, Jacob, sa&shy;id un&shy;to my son Enos, <q>Take these plates.</q>
</p>


<h2 id="enos">Enos</h2>
<p>
    <sup>1:1</sup>&#8239;I, Enos, know&shy;ing my fa&shy;ther that he was a just man &mdash; for he taught me in his lan&shy;guage, and al&shy;so in the nur&shy;ture and ad&shy;mo&shy;ni&shy;tion of God ---
    <sup>3</sup>&#8239;I went to hunt beasts in the for&shy;ests; and the words which I had of&shy;ten heard my fa&shy;ther speak con&shy;cern&shy;ing e&shy;ter&shy;nal life, and the joy of the saints, sunk deep in&shy;to my heart.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>1:4</sup>&#8239;My soul hun&shy;gered; and I kneeled down be&shy;fore my Mak&shy;er, and I cried un&shy;to him in might&shy;y pray&shy;er and sup&shy;pli&shy;ca&shy;tion for mine own soul;
    <sup>5</sup>&#8239;And there came a voice un&shy;to me, say&shy;ing: <q>Enos, thy sins are for&shy;giv&shy;en thee, and thou shalt be bless&shy;ed.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>1:9</sup>&#8239;Now, it came to pas&shy;s that when I had heard these words I be&shy;gan to feel a de&shy;sire for the wel&shy;fare of my peo&shy;ple; where&shy;fore, I did pour out my whole soul un&shy;to God for them.
    <sup>19</sup>&#8239;And now it came to pas&shy;s that I, Enos, went a&shy;bout a&shy;mong my peo&shy;ple, prophesying of things to come, and tes&shy;ti&shy;fy&shy;ing of the things which I had heard and seen.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>1:26</sup>&#8239;I have de&shy;clared it in all my days, and have re&shy;joiced in it a&shy;bove that of the world.
    <sup>27</sup>&#8239;And I soon go to the place of my rest, which is with my Re&shy;deem&shy;er. And he will say un&shy;to me, <q>Come un&shy;to me, ye bless&shy;ed, there is a place pre&shy;pared for you in the man&shy;sions of my Fa&shy;ther.</q> A&shy;men.
</p>


<h2 id="jarom">Jarom</h2>
<p>
    <sup>1:9</sup>&#8239;The word of God was ver&shy;i&shy;fied, which he spake un&shy;to our fa&shy;thers, say&shy;ing that: <q>Inasmuch as ye will keep my com&shy;mand&shy;ments ye shall pros&shy;per in the land.</q>
</p>


<h2 id="omni">Om&shy;ni</h2>
<p>
    <sup>1:5</sup>&#8239;The more wick&shy;ed part of my peo&shy;ple were de&shy;stroyed.
    <sup>6</sup>&#8239;For God would not suf&shy;fer, af&shy;ter he had led them out of the land of Je&shy;ru&shy;sa&shy;lem and kept and pre&shy;served them from fall&shy;ing in&shy;to the hands of their enemies, yea, he would not suf&shy;fer that the words should not be ver&shy;i&shy;fied, which he spake un&shy;to our fa&shy;thers, say&shy;ing that: <q>Inasmuch as ye will not keep my com&shy;mand&shy;ments ye shall not pros&shy;per in the land.</q>
    <sup>7</sup>&#8239;Where&shy;fore, God did vis&shy;it them in great judg&shy;ment; nev&shy;er&shy;the&shy;less, he did spare the right&shy;eous that they should not per&shy;ish, but did de&shy;liv&shy;er them out of the hands of their enemies.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>1:25</sup>&#8239;There is noth&shy;ing which is good save it co&shy;mes from God; and that which is e&shy;vil com&shy;eth from the dev&shy;il.
    <sup>26</sup>&#8239;Of&shy;fer your whole souls as an of&shy;fer&shy;ing un&shy;to Christ, and con&shy;tin&shy;ue in fasting and praying, and en&shy;dure to the end; and as God liveth ye will be saved.
</p>


<h2 id="zeniff">Zeniff</h2>
<p>
<div class="centered"><em class="italic">Tak&shy;en from chap&shy;ters 9-24 of the Book of Mo&shy;si&shy;ah.</em></div>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>9:1</sup>&#8239;I, Zeniff, had a knowl&shy;edge of the land of our fa&shy;thers&#x02BC; first in&shy;her&shy;it&shy;ance.
    <sup>3</sup>&#8239;Be&shy;ing o&shy;ver-zealous to in&shy;her&shy;it the land of our fa&shy;thers, I col&shy;lect&shy;ed as man&shy;y as were de&shy;sir&shy;ous to go up to pos&shy;sess the land, and started on our jour&shy;ney in&shy;to the wil&shy;der&shy;ness to go up to the land.
    <sup>5</sup>&#8239;I went in&shy;to the cit&shy;y, in un&shy;to the king, that I might know if I might go in with my peo&shy;ple and pos&shy;sess the land in peace.
    <sup>6</sup>&#8239;He cov&shy;e&shy;nanted with me that I might pos&shy;sess the land.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>9:8</sup>&#8239;We be&shy;gan to build build&shy;ings, and to re&shy;pair the walls of the cit&shy;y,
    <sup>9</sup>&#8239;and to till the ground; and we did be&shy;gin to mul&shy;ti&shy;ply and pros&shy;per in the land.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>11:1</sup>&#8239;And now Zeniff con&shy;ferred the king&shy;dom up&shy;on Noah, one of his sons; there&shy;fore Noah be&shy;gan to reign in his stead; and he did not walk in the ways of his fa&shy;ther.
    <sup>2</sup>&#8239;For be&shy;hold, he did not keep the com&shy;mand&shy;ments of God, but he did walk af&shy;ter the de&shy;sires of his own heart. And he had man&shy;y wives and con&shy;cu&shy;bines.
    <sup>3</sup>&#8239;And he laid a tax of one fifth part of all the peo&shy;ple pos&shy;sessed.
    <sup>4</sup>&#8239;And all this did he take to sup&shy;port him&shy;self, and his wives and his con&shy;cu&shy;bines; and al&shy;so his priests, and their wives and their con&shy;cu&shy;bines; thus he had changed the af&shy;fairs of the king&shy;dom.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>11:20</sup>&#8239;There was a man whose name was Abinadi; and he went forth a&shy;mong the peo&shy;ple, and be&shy;gan to proph&shy;e&shy;sy, say&shy;ing: <q>Thus saith God, <q>Wo be un&shy;to this peo&shy;ple, for I have seen their a&shy;bom&shy;i&shy;na&shy;tions, and their wick&shy;ed&shy;ness, and their whore&shy;doms.
    <sup>21</sup>&#8239;And ex&shy;cept they re&shy;pent be&shy;hold, I will de&shy;liv&shy;er them in&shy;to the hands of their enemies; yea, and they shall be brought in&shy;to bond&shy;age.</q></q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>11:27</sup>&#8239;Now when king Noah had heard of the words which Abinadi had spo&shy;ken un&shy;to the peo&shy;ple, he was wroth; and he sa&shy;id: <q>Who is Abinadi, that I and my peo&shy;ple should be judged of him, or who is God, that shall bring up&shy;on my peo&shy;ple such great af&shy;flic&shy;tion?
    <sup>28</sup>&#8239;I com&shy;mand you to bring Abinadi hith&shy;er, that I may slay him.</q>
    <sup>29</sup>&#8239;The peo&shy;ple sought from that time for&shy;ward to take him.
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>12:1</sup>&#8239;Af&shy;ter the space of two years Abinadi came a&shy;mong the peo&shy;ple in dis&shy;guise, and they knew him not, and he be&shy;gan to proph&shy;e&shy;sy a&shy;mong them, say&shy;ing,
    <sup>2</sup>&#8239;<q>Thus saith God, <q>It shall come to pas&shy;s that this gen&shy;er&shy;a&shy;tion, be&shy;cause of their iniquities, shall be brought in&shy;to bond&shy;age.</q></q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>12:9</sup>&#8239;They were an&shy;gry with him; and they took him and car&shy;ried him bound be&shy;fore the king.
    <sup>17</sup>&#8239;King Noah caused that Abinadi should be cast in&shy;to pris&shy;on, and he com&shy;manded that the priests should gath&shy;er them&shy;selves to&shy;geth&shy;er.
    <sup>19</sup>&#8239;And the priests be&shy;gan to ques&shy;tion Abinadi, that they might cross him, but he an&shy;swered them bold&shy;ly, and with&shy;stood all their ques&shy;tions, to their a&shy;ston&shy;ish&shy;ment.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>12:25</sup>&#8239;And now Abinadi sa&shy;id un&shy;to them,
    <sup>27</sup>&#8239;<q>What teach ye this peo&shy;ple?</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>12:28</sup>&#8239;And they sa&shy;id: <q>We teach the law of Mo&shy;ses.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>12:29</sup>&#8239;He sa&shy;id un&shy;to them: <q>If ye teach the law of Mo&shy;ses why do ye not keep it? Why do ye set your hearts up&shy;on rich&shy;es? Why do ye com&shy;mit whore&shy;doms and spend your strength with har&shy;lots?</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>13:1</sup>&#8239;When the king had heard these words, he sa&shy;id un&shy;to his priests: <q>A&shy;way with this fel&shy;low, and slay him.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>13:2</sup>&#8239;And they at&shy;tempted to lay their hands on him; but he with&shy;stood them, and sa&shy;id un&shy;to them:
    <sup>3</sup>&#8239;<q>Tou&shy;ch me not, for I have not de&shy;liv&shy;ered the mes&shy;sage which God sent me to de&shy;liv&shy;er.
    <sup>4</sup>&#8239;Be&shy;cause I have told you the truth ye are an&shy;gry with me.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>15:26</sup>&#8239;<q>But be&shy;hold, and fear, and trem&shy;ble be&shy;fore God, for ye ought to trem&shy;ble; for God redeemeth none such that have wil&shy;ful&shy;ly rebelled a&shy;gainst him, that have known the com&shy;mand&shy;ments of God, and would not keep them.</q>
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>17:1</sup>&#8239;When Abinadi had fin&shy;ished these say&shy;ings, the king com&shy;manded that the priests should take him and cause that he should be put to death.

    <sup>17:2</sup>&#8239;There was one a&shy;mong them whose name was Al&shy;ma, and he was a young man, and he be&shy;lieved the words which Abinadi had spo&shy;ken; there&shy;fore he be&shy;gan to plead with the king that Abinadi might de&shy;part in peace.
    <sup>3</sup>&#8239;But the king was more wroth, and sent his serv&shy;ants af&shy;ter Al&shy;ma that they might slay him.
    <sup>4</sup>&#8239;But he fled from be&shy;fore them and hid him&shy;self that they found him not. And he be&shy;ing con&shy;cealed for man&shy;y days did write all the words which Abinadi had spo&shy;ken.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>17:5</sup>&#8239;The king caused that his guards should sur&shy;round Abinadi and take him.
    <sup>7</sup>&#8239;And he sa&shy;id un&shy;to him: <q>Abinadi, thou art wor&shy;thy of death.
    <sup>8</sup>&#8239;Thou shalt be put to death un&shy;less thou wilt re&shy;call all the words which thou hast spo&shy;ken e&shy;vil con&shy;cern&shy;ing me and my peo&shy;ple.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>17:9</sup>&#8239;Now Abinadi sa&shy;id un&shy;to him: <q>I will not re&shy;call the words which I have spo&shy;ken un&shy;to you con&shy;cern&shy;ing this peo&shy;ple, for they are true.
    <sup>10</sup>&#8239;Yea, and I will suf&shy;fer e&shy;ven un&shy;til death, and I will not re&shy;call my words, and they shall stand as a tes&shy;ti&shy;mo&shy;ny a&shy;gainst you.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>17:11</sup>&#8239;And now king Noah was a&shy;bout to re&shy;lease him, for he feared that the judg&shy;ments of God would come up&shy;on him.
    <sup>12</sup>&#8239;But the priests lifted up their voices say&shy;ing: <q>He has re&shy;viled the king.</q> There&shy;fore the king was stirred up in an&shy;ger a&shy;gainst him, and he de&shy;liv&shy;ered him up that he might be slain.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>17:13</sup>&#8239;They took him and bound him, and scourged his skin with fag&shy;ots, yea, e&shy;ven un&shy;to death.
    <sup>14</sup>&#8239;When the flames be&shy;gan to scorch him, he cried un&shy;to them, say&shy;ing:
    <sup>16</sup>&#8239;<q>Ye shall be af&shy;flicted with all man&shy;ner of dis&shy;eases be&shy;cause of your iniquities.
    <sup>17</sup>&#8239;Ye shall be smit&shy;ten on eve&shy;ry hand, and shall be driv&shy;en and scat&shy;tered to and fro.
    <sup>18</sup>&#8239;Ye shall be hunt&shy;ed, and tak&shy;en by the hand of your enemies, and then ye shall suf&shy;fer, as I suf&shy;fer, the pains of death by fire.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>17:20</sup>&#8239;When Abinadi had sa&shy;id these words, he fell, hav&shy;ing suf&shy;fered death by fire; yea, hav&shy;ing been put to death be&shy;cause he would not de&shy;ny the com&shy;mand&shy;ments of God, hav&shy;ing sealed the truth of his words by his death.

    <sup>18:1</sup>&#8239;Al&shy;ma, who had fled from the serv&shy;ants of king Noah went a&shy;bout pri&shy;vate&shy;ly a&shy;mong the peo&shy;ple, and be&shy;gan to teach the words of Abinadi.
    <sup>3</sup>&#8239;He taught them pri&shy;vate&shy;ly, that it might not come to the knowl&shy;edge of the king. And man&shy;y did be&shy;lieve his words.
    <sup>4</sup>&#8239;As man&shy;y as did be&shy;lieve him did go forth to a place which was in the bor&shy;ders of the land.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>18:8</sup>&#8239;He sa&shy;id un&shy;to them: <q>As ye are de&shy;sir&shy;ous to come in&shy;to the fold of God, and to be called his peo&shy;ple, and are will&shy;ing to bear one an&shy;oth&shy;er&#x02BC;s bur&shy;dens, that they may be light;

</p>

<p>
    <sup>18:11</sup>&#8239;When the peo&shy;ple had heard these words, they ex&shy;claimed: <q>This is the de&shy;sire of our hearts.</q>

</p>

<p>
    <sup>23:1</sup>&#8239;Now Al&shy;ma, hav&shy;ing been warned of God that the armies of king Noah would come up&shy;on them, and hav&shy;ing made it known to his peo&shy;ple, there&shy;fore they gath&shy;ered to&shy;geth&shy;er their flocks, and took of their grain, and de&shy;part&shy;ed in&shy;to the wil&shy;der&shy;ness be&shy;fore the armies of king Noah.
    <sup>3</sup>&#8239;And they fled eight days&#x02BC; jour&shy;ney in&shy;to the wil&shy;der&shy;ness.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>23:4</sup>&#8239;They came to a ver&shy;y beau&shy;ti&shy;ful and pleas&shy;ant land, a land of pure wa&shy;ter.

</p>

<p>
    <sup>23:6</sup>&#8239;The peo&shy;ple were de&shy;sir&shy;ous that Al&shy;ma should be their king, for he was be&shy;lov&shy;ed by his peo&shy;ple.
    <sup>7</sup>&#8239;But he sa&shy;id un&shy;to them: <q>Be&shy;hold, it is not ex&shy;pe&shy;di&shy;ent that we should have a king; for thus saith God: <q>Ye shall not es&shy;teem one flesh a&shy;bove an&shy;oth&shy;er, or one man shall not think him&shy;self a&shy;bove an&shy;oth&shy;er;</q> there&shy;fore I say un&shy;to you it is not ex&shy;pe&shy;di&shy;ent that ye should have a king.
    <sup>8</sup>&#8239;Nev&shy;er&shy;the&shy;less, if it were pos&shy;si&shy;ble that ye could al&shy;ways have just men to be your kings it would be well for you to have a king.
    <sup>9</sup>&#8239;But re&shy;mem&shy;ber the in&shy;iq&shy;ui&shy;ty of king Noah and his priests.
    <sup>12</sup>&#8239;Ye have been op&shy;pressed by king Noah, and have been in bond&shy;age to him and his priests.

</p>

<p>
    <sup>23:15</sup>&#8239;Thus did Al&shy;ma teach his peo&shy;ple, that eve&shy;ry man should love his neigh&shy;bor as him&shy;self, that there should be no con&shy;ten&shy;tion a&shy;mong them.

<p>
    <sup>1:2</sup>&#8239;In the first year of the reign of Al&shy;ma in the judg&shy;ment seat, there was a man brought be&shy;fore him to be judged, and his name was Nehor.
    <sup>3</sup>&#8239;He had gone a&shy;bout a&shy;mong the peo&shy;ple, preaching that eve&shy;ry priest and teach&shy;er ought to be&shy;come pop&shy;u&shy;lar; and they ought not to la&shy;bor with their hands, but that they ought to be sup&shy;ported by the peo&shy;ple.

    <sup>1:7</sup>&#8239;As he was go&shy;ing to preach to those who be&shy;lieved on his word, Nehor met a man and he be&shy;gan to con&shy;tend with him sharp&shy;ly, but the man with&shy;stood him, admonishing him with the words of God.
    <sup>8</sup>&#8239;Now the name of the man was Gid&shy;e&shy;on.
    <sup>9</sup>&#8239;Be&shy;cause Gid&shy;e&shy;on with&shy;stood him with the words of God Nehor was wroth with Gid&shy;e&shy;on, and drew his sword and be&shy;gan to smite him.

<p>
    <sup>1:10</sup>&#8239;Nehor was tak&shy;en by the peo&shy;ple of the church, and was brought be&shy;fore Al&shy;ma, to be judged ac&shy;cord&shy;ing to the crimes which he had com&shy;mit&shy;ted.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>1:12</sup>&#8239;Al&shy;ma sa&shy;id un&shy;to him: <q>Be&shy;hold, this is the first time that priest&shy;craft has been in&shy;tro&shy;duced a&shy;mong this peo&shy;ple. And be&shy;hold, thou art not on&shy;ly guilt&shy;y of priest&shy;craft, but hast en&shy;deav&shy;ored to en&shy;force it by the sword.

    <sup>16</sup>&#8239;Nev&shy;er&shy;the&shy;less, this did not put an end to the spreading of priest&shy;craft through the land; for there were man&shy;y who loved the vain things of the world, and they went forth preaching false doc&shy;trines for the sa&shy;ke of rich&shy;es and hon&shy;or.

</p>

<p>
    <sup>11:20</sup>&#8239;Now, it was for the sole pur&shy;pose to get gain, there&shy;fore, they did stir up the peo&shy;ple to riotings, and all man&shy;ner of dis&shy;turb&shy;ances and wick&shy;ed&shy;ness, that they might have more em&shy;ploy, that they might get mon&shy;ey ac&shy;cord&shy;ing to the suits which were brought be&shy;fore them; there&shy;fore they did stir up the peo&shy;ple a&shy;gainst Al&shy;ma and Am&shy;u&shy;lek.

    <sup>27:4</sup>&#8239;When Ammon and his breth&shy;ren saw this great work of de&shy;struc&shy;tion, they were moved with com&shy;pas&shy;sion, and they sa&shy;id un&shy;to the king,

    <sup>27:14</sup>&#8239;And they gath&shy;ered to&shy;geth&shy;er all their peo&shy;ple, and all their flocks and herds, and de&shy;part&shy;ed out of the land, and came in&shy;to the land of Zarahemla.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>27:21</sup>&#8239;The chief judge sent a proc&shy;la&shy;ma&shy;tion through&shy;out all the land, de&shy;sir&shy;ing the voice of the peo&shy;ple con&shy;cern&shy;ing the ad&shy;mit&shy;ting the peo&shy;ple of An&shy;ti-Nephi-Lehi.
    <sup>22</sup>&#8239;The voice of the peo&shy;ple came, say&shy;ing, <q>The land Jershon is the land which we will give un&shy;to our breth&shy;ren for an in&shy;her&shy;it&shy;ance.
    <sup>23</sup>&#8239;We will set our armies that we may pro&shy;tect our breth&shy;ren in the land Jershon; and this we do for our breth&shy;ren, on ac&shy;count of their fear to take up arms lest they should com&shy;mit sin.
    <sup>24</sup>&#8239;We will guard them from their enemies, on con&shy;di&shy;tion that they will give us a por&shy;tion of their sub&shy;stance to as&shy;sist us that we may main&shy;tain our armies.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>27:26</sup>&#8239;They went down in&shy;to the land of Jershon; and they were called the peo&shy;ple of Ammon; there&shy;fore they were dis&shy;tin&shy;guished by that name ev&shy;er af&shy;ter.
    <sup>27</sup>&#8239;They were dis&shy;tin&shy;guished for their zeal to&shy;wards God, and al&shy;so to&shy;wards men; for they were per&shy;fect&shy;ly hon&shy;est and up&shy;right in all things.
    <sup>28</sup>&#8239;And they did look up&shy;on shed&shy;ding the blood of their breth&shy;ren with the great&shy;est ab&shy;hor&shy;rence; and they nev&shy;er could be pre&shy;vailed up&shy;on to take up arms a&shy;gainst their breth&shy;ren.
    <sup>29</sup>&#8239;They would suf&shy;fer death in the most ag&shy;gra&shy;vat&shy;ing and distressing man&shy;ner be&shy;fore they would take the sword to smite them.

<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>29:2</sup>&#8239;I, Al&shy;ma, would de&shy;clare un&shy;to eve&shy;ry soul re&shy;pent&shy;ance, that they should re&shy;pent and come un&shy;to God, that there might not be more sor&shy;row up&shy;on all the face of the earth.
    <sup>5</sup>&#8239;I know that he that knoweth not good from e&shy;vil is blame&shy;less.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>29:8</sup>&#8239;God doth grant un&shy;to all na&shy;tions, of their own na&shy;tion and tongue, to teach his word, yea, in wis&shy;dom, all that he seeth fit that they should have.

<p>
    <sup>29:10</sup>&#8239;When I see man&shy;y of my breth&shy;ren tru&shy;ly pen&shy;i&shy;tent, then is my soul filled with joy; then do I re&shy;mem&shy;ber his mer&shy;ci&shy;ful arm which he ex&shy;tend&shy;ed to&shy;wards me.

    <sup>30:6</sup>&#8239;In the end of the sev&shy;en&shy;teenth year, there came a man in&shy;to the land of Zarahemla who be&shy;gan to preach a&shy;gainst the com&shy;ing of Christ.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>30:7</sup>&#8239;Now there was no law a&shy;gainst a man&#x02BC;s be&shy;lief.
    <sup>9</sup>&#8239;If a man de&shy;sired to serve God, it was his priv&shy;i&shy;lege; but if he did not be&shy;lieve in him there was no law to pun&shy;ish him.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>30:12</sup>&#8239;This man, whose name was Kor&shy;i&shy;hor, be&shy;gan to preach un&shy;to the peo&shy;ple that there should be no Christ.  And af&shy;ter this man&shy;ner did he preach, say&shy;ing,
    <sup>14</sup>&#8239;<q>These things which ye call prophecies, are fool&shy;ish tra&shy;di&shy;tions of your fa&shy;thers.
    <sup>15</sup>&#8239;Ye can&shy;not know of things which ye do not see.
    <sup>16</sup>&#8239;Ye say that ye see a re&shy;mis&shy;sion of your sins. But be&shy;hold, it is the ef&shy;fect of a fren&shy;zied mind; and this de&shy;range&shy;ment of your minds co&shy;mes be&shy;cause of the tra&shy;di&shy;tions of your fa&shy;thers, which lead you a&shy;way in&shy;to a be&shy;lief of things which are not so.</q>
    <sup>17</sup>&#8239;And man&shy;y more such things did he say un&shy;to them, tell&shy;ing them that what&shy;so&shy;ev&shy;er a man did was no crime.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>30:31</sup>&#8239;He did rise up in great swell&shy;ing words be&shy;fore Al&shy;ma, and did re&shy;vile a&shy;gainst the priests, ac&shy;cus&shy;ing them of lead&shy;ing a&shy;way the peo&shy;ple af&shy;ter the sil&shy;ly tra&shy;di&shy;tions of their fa&shy;thers, for the sa&shy;ke of glut&shy;ting on the la&shy;bors of the peo&shy;ple.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>30:32</sup>&#8239;Al&shy;ma sa&shy;id un&shy;to him, <q>Thou knowest that we do not glut our&shy;selves up&shy;on the la&shy;bors of this peo&shy;ple. I have la&shy;bored with mine own hands for my sup&shy;port.
    <sup>33</sup>&#8239;Not&shy;with&shy;stand&shy;ing the man&shy;y la&shy;bors which I have per&shy;formed in the church, I have nev&shy;er re&shy;ceived so much as one pen&shy;ny for my la&shy;bor; nei&shy;ther has an&shy;y of my breth&shy;ren.</q> 
    <sup>40</sup>&#8239;<q>What ev&shy;i&shy;dence have ye that there is no God?
    <sup>41</sup>&#8239;I have all things as a tes&shy;ti&shy;mo&shy;ny that these things are true.
    <sup>44</sup>&#8239;All things de&shy;note there is a God; yea, e&shy;ven the earth, and all things that are up&shy;on the face of it, and its mo&shy;tion, and al&shy;so all the plan&shy;ets which move in their reg&shy;u&shy;lar form.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>30:48</sup>&#8239;Kor&shy;i&shy;hor sa&shy;id un&shy;to him, <q>I do not be&shy;lieve that there is a God; and ex&shy;cept ye show me a sign, I will not be&shy;lieve.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>30:49</sup>&#8239;Al&shy;ma sa&shy;id un&shy;to him, <q>This will I give un&shy;to thee for a sign, that ye shall no more have ut&shy;ter&shy;ance.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>30:50</sup>&#8239;Now when Al&shy;ma had sa&shy;id these words, Kor&shy;i&shy;hor was struck dumb.
    <sup>52</sup>&#8239;Kor&shy;i&shy;hor put forth his hand and wrote, say&shy;ing: <q>I al&shy;ways knew that there was a God,
    <sup>53</sup>&#8239;but the dev&shy;il hath de&shy;ceived me, and I have taught his words. I taught them be&shy;cause they were pleas&shy;ing un&shy;to the car&shy;nal mind; and I taught them, in&shy;so&shy;much that I be&shy;lieved that they were true.</q>
    <sup>58</sup>&#8239;And Kor&shy;i&shy;hor did go a&shy;bout from house to house, begging food for his sup&shy;port.
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>31:1</sup>&#8239;Af&shy;ter the end of Kor&shy;i&shy;hor, Al&shy;ma re&shy;ceived tid&shy;ings that Zoram was lead&shy;ing the hearts of the peo&shy;ple to bow down to i&shy;dols.
    <sup>5</sup>&#8239;And now, as the preaching of the word had a great ten&shy;den&shy;cy to lead the peo&shy;ple to do that which was just &mdash; yea, it had had more pow&shy;er&shy;ful ef&shy;fect up&shy;on the minds of the peo&shy;ple than the sword, or an&shy;y&shy;thing else which had hap&shy;pened un&shy;to them &mdash; there&shy;fore Al&shy;ma thought it was ex&shy;pe&shy;di&shy;ent that they should try the vir&shy;tue of the word of God.
    <sup>7</sup>&#8239;There&shy;fore he went a&shy;mong the Zoramites, to preach un&shy;to them the word.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>32:2</sup>&#8239;Af&shy;ter much la&shy;bor a&shy;mong them, they be&shy;gan to have suc&shy;cess a&shy;mong the poor class of peo&shy;ple; for be&shy;hold, they were cast out of the syn&shy;a&shy;gogues be&shy;cause of the coarse&shy;ness of their ap&shy;par&shy;el.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>32:5</sup>&#8239;One a&shy;mong them sa&shy;id, <q>They have cast us out of our syn&shy;a&shy;gogues and we have no place to wor&shy;ship our God. What shall we do?</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>32:6</sup>&#8239;When Al&shy;ma heard this, he be&shy;held that their af&shy;flic&shy;tions had tru&shy;ly humbled them and that they were in a prep&shy;a&shy;ra&shy;tion to hear the word.
    <sup>7</sup>&#8239;There&shy;fore he sa&shy;id un&shy;to them,
    <sup>10</sup>&#8239;<q>Do ye sup&shy;pose that ye can&shy;not wor&shy;ship God save it be in your syn&shy;a&shy;gogues on&shy;ly?
    <sup>11</sup>&#8239;Do ye sup&shy;pose that ye must wor&shy;ship God on&shy;ly once in a week?</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>32:12</sup>&#8239;<q>It is well that ye are cast out of your syn&shy;a&shy;gogues, that ye may be hum&shy;ble, and that ye may learn wis&shy;dom.
    <sup>22</sup>&#8239;God is mer&shy;ci&shy;ful un&shy;to all who be&shy;lieve on his word.
    <sup>23</sup>&#8239;He imparteth his word un&shy;to men, yea, wom&shy;en al&shy;so. Now this is not all; lit&shy;tle chil&shy;dren do have words giv&shy;en un&shy;to them man&shy;y times which con&shy;found the wise and the learn&shy;ed.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>32:28</sup>&#8239;<q>We will com&shy;pare the word un&shy;to a seed. If ye give place, that a seed may be planted in your heart, ye will be&shy;gin to say with&shy;in yourselves, <q>It is a good seed, for it beginneth to en&shy;light&shy;en my un&shy;der&shy;stand&shy;ing.</q></q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>32:33</sup>&#8239;<q>Be&shy;cause ye have tried the ex&shy;per&shy;i&shy;ment, and planted the seed,
    <sup>34</sup>&#8239;ye know that the word hath sprouted up, that your un&shy;der&shy;stand&shy;ing doth be&shy;gin to be en&shy;light&shy;ened, and your mind doth be&shy;gin to ex&shy;pand.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>32:37</sup>&#8239;<q>As the tree beginneth to grow, ye will say: <q>Let us nour&shy;ish it with great care, that it may bring forth fruit.</q>
    <sup>38</sup>&#8239;But if ye ne&shy;glect the tree, and take no thought for its nour&shy;ish&shy;ment, it with&shy;ers a&shy;way.
    <sup>39</sup>&#8239;Now, this is not be&shy;cause the seed was not good, nei&shy;ther is it be&shy;cause the fruit there&shy;of would not be de&shy;sir&shy;a&shy;ble; but it is be&shy;cause ye will not nour&shy;ish the tree.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>33:2</sup>&#8239;Al&shy;ma sa&shy;id un&shy;to them, <q>Ye have sa&shy;id that ye could not wor&shy;ship God be&shy;cause ye are cast out of your syn&shy;a&shy;gogues.  But ye do great&shy;ly err.
    <sup>3</sup>&#8239;Do ye re&shy;mem&shy;ber what Zenos, the proph&shy;et of old, has sa&shy;id con&shy;cern&shy;ing pray&shy;er?
    <sup>4</sup>&#8239;He sa&shy;id, <q>Thou art mer&shy;ci&shy;ful, O God, for thou hast heard my pray&shy;er, e&shy;ven when I was in the wil&shy;der&shy;ness,
    <sup>5</sup>&#8239;and when I did cry un&shy;to thee in my field.

</p>

<p>
    <sup>34:28</sup>&#8239;<q>Do not sup&shy;pose that this is all; if ye turn a&shy;way the need&shy;y, and the na&shy;ked, and vis&shy;it not the sick and af&shy;flicted, and im&shy;part of your sub&shy;stance, if ye have, to those who stand in need, your pray&shy;er is vain, and availeth you noth&shy;ing, and ye are hyp&shy;o&shy;crites.

    <sup>5</sup>&#8239;For they re&shy;mem&shy;bered the words which their fa&shy;ther Helaman spake un&shy;to them:
</p>

<p>
    <sup>5:6</sup>&#8239;<q>My sons, I de&shy;sire that ye should re&shy;mem&shy;ber to keep the com&shy;mand&shy;ments of God; and that ye should de&shy;clare un&shy;to the peo&shy;ple these words;

</p>

<p>
    <sup>5:14</sup>&#8239;They did re&shy;mem&shy;ber his words, and there&shy;fore they went forth to teach the word of God a&shy;mong all the peo&shy;ple.

    <sup>6:7</sup>&#8239;There was peace in all the land, in&shy;so&shy;much that the peo&shy;ple did go in&shy;to what&shy;so&shy;ev&shy;er part of the land they would.

<p>
    <sup>6:11</sup>&#8239;There were al&shy;so cu&shy;ri&shy;ous workmen, who did work all kinds of o&shy;re and did re&shy;fine it.
    <sup>12</sup>&#8239;They did raise grain in a&shy;bun&shy;dance, and they did raise man&shy;y flocks and herds.
    <sup>13</sup>&#8239;They did toil and spin, and make cloth of eve&shy;ry kind to clothe their na&shy;ked&shy;ness. And thus the six&shy;ty-fourth year did pas&shy;s a&shy;way in peace.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>6:15</sup>&#8239;In the six&shy;ty-sixth year of the reign of the judges, Cezoram was mur&shy;dered.  His son, who had been ap&shy;point&shy;ed by the peo&shy;ple in his stead, was al&shy;so mur&shy;dered.

<p>
    <sup>6:18</sup>&#8239;Those mur&shy;der&shy;ers and plunderers were a band who had been formed by Gadianton.
    <sup>22</sup>&#8239;They did have signs, and se&shy;cret words that they might dis&shy;tin&shy;guish a broth&shy;er who had en&shy;tered in&shy;to the cov&shy;e&shy;nant, that what&shy;so&shy;ev&shy;er wick&shy;ed&shy;ness he should do he should not be in&shy;jured by those who did be&shy;long to his band.
    <sup>23</sup>&#8239;Thus they might mur&shy;der, and plun&shy;der, and steal, and com&shy;mit whore&shy;doms and all man&shy;ner of wick&shy;ed&shy;ness, con&shy;tra&shy;ry to the laws of their coun&shy;try and al&shy;so the laws of God.

</p>

<p>
    <sup>8:25</sup>&#8239;<q>Ye have re&shy;jected the truth, and rebelled a&shy;gainst God. In&shy;stead of lay&shy;ing up for yourselves treas&shy;ures in heav&shy;en, where noth&shy;ing doth cor&shy;rupt, ye are heap&shy;ing up for yourselves wrath a&shy;gainst the day of judg&shy;ment.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>10:17</sup>&#8239;He did go forth, from mul&shy;ti&shy;tude to mul&shy;ti&shy;tude, de&shy;clar&shy;ing the word of God, e&shy;ven un&shy;til he had de&shy;clared it un&shy;to all the peo&shy;ple.

<p>
    <sup>11:1</sup>&#8239;In the sev&shy;en&shy;ty-second year of the reign of the judges, the con&shy;ten&shy;tions did in&shy;crease, in&shy;so&shy;much that there were wars through&shy;out all the land.
    <sup>2</sup>&#8239;This war did last all that year, and in the sev&shy;en&shy;ty-third year.

<p>
    <sup>11:5</sup>&#8239;And so it was done, ac&shy;cord&shy;ing to the words of Nephi, and there was a great fam&shy;ine up&shy;on the land.

    <sup>6</sup>&#8239;And this work of de&shy;struc&shy;tion did al&shy;so con&shy;tin&shy;ue in the sev&shy;en&shy;ty-fifth year. For the earth was smit&shy;ten that it was dry, and did not yield forth grain in the sea&shy;son of grain.

<p>
    <sup>11:7</sup>&#8239;The peo&shy;ple saw that they were a&shy;bout to per&shy;ish, and they be&shy;gan to re&shy;mem&shy;ber God, and the words of Nephi.

<p>
    <sup>11:9</sup>&#8239;Nephi saw that the peo&shy;ple had re&shy;pented and did hum&shy;ble them&shy;selves. He cried a&shy;gain un&shy;to God, say&shy;ing,

    <sup>1:4</sup>&#8239;In the nine&shy;ty-second year, the prophecies of the proph&shy;ets be&shy;gan to be ful&shy;filled.
    <sup>5</sup>&#8239;But there were some who be&shy;gan to say that the time was past for the words to be ful&shy;filled, which were spo&shy;ken by Samuel.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>1:9</sup>&#8239;There was a day set a&shy;part by the un&shy;be&shy;liev&shy;ers, that all those who be&shy;lieved should be put to death ex&shy;cept the sign should come to pas&shy;s, which had been giv&shy;en by Samuel the proph&shy;et.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>1:10</sup>&#8239;When Nephi, the son of Nephi, saw this wick&shy;ed&shy;ness, his heart was ex&shy;ceed&shy;ing&shy;ly sorrowful.
    <sup>11</sup>&#8239;He went out and bowed him&shy;self down up&shy;on the earth, and cried to God.
    <sup>12</sup>&#8239;And the voice of God came un&shy;to him say&shy;ing,
    <sup>13</sup>&#8239;<q>Be of good cheer; for on this night shall the sign be giv&shy;en.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>1:15</sup>&#8239;And the words which came un&shy;to Nephi were ful&shy;filled.
    <sup>26</sup>&#8239;And thus the nine&shy;ty-second year did pas&shy;s a&shy;way.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>1:27</sup>&#8239;The nine&shy;ty-third year did pas&shy;s a&shy;way in peace, save it were for the Gadianton rob&shy;bers, who did com&shy;mit man&shy;y mur&shy;ders, and did do much slaugh&shy;ter a&shy;mong the peo&shy;ple.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>1:28</sup>&#8239;In the nine&shy;ty-fourth year the rob&shy;bers be&shy;gan to in&shy;crease in great de&shy;gree.
    <sup>29</sup>&#8239;And there was much sor&shy;row a&shy;mong the peo&shy;ple; for be&shy;hold, they had man&shy;y chil&shy;dren who did join those Gadianton rob&shy;bers.
    <sup>30</sup>&#8239;And thus the peo&shy;ple be&shy;gan to de&shy;crease as to their faith and right&shy;eous&shy;ness, be&shy;cause of the wick&shy;ed&shy;ness of the ris&shy;ing gen&shy;er&shy;a&shy;tion.
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>2:3</sup>&#8239;The peo&shy;ple be&shy;gan to wax strong in wick&shy;ed&shy;ness and a&shy;bom&shy;i&shy;na&shy;tions.
    <sup>4</sup>&#8239;And thus did pas&shy;s a&shy;way the nine&shy;ty-sixth, nine&shy;ty-seventh, nine&shy;ty-eighth, and nine&shy;ty-ninth years.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:7</sup>&#8239;Nine years had pas&shy;sed a&shy;way since the sign was giv&shy;en that Christ should come in&shy;to the world.
    <sup>8</sup>&#8239;The peo&shy;ple be&shy;gan to reck&shy;on their time from when the sign was giv&shy;en, or from the com&shy;ing of Christ; there&shy;fore, nine years had pas&shy;sed a&shy;way.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:10</sup>&#8239;The peo&shy;ple did still re&shy;main in wick&shy;ed&shy;ness; and thus pas&shy;sed a&shy;way the tenth and e&shy;lev&shy;enth year in in&shy;iq&shy;ui&shy;ty.
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>2:11</sup>&#8239;In the thir&shy;teenth year the Gadianton rob&shy;bers had be&shy;come so nu&shy;mer&shy;ous, and did slay so man&shy;y of the peo&shy;ple, that all the peo&shy;ple
    <sup>12</sup>&#8239;were com&shy;pelled, for the safe&shy;ty of their lives and their wom&shy;en and their chil&shy;dren, to take up arms a&shy;gainst those Gadianton rob&shy;bers, to main&shy;tain their free&shy;dom and their lib&shy;er&shy;ty.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:17</sup>&#8239;In the four&shy;teenth year, the peo&shy;ple did gain some ad&shy;van&shy;tage of the rob&shy;bers.
    <sup>18</sup>&#8239;In the fif&shy;teenth year, be&shy;cause of the wick&shy;ed&shy;ness of the peo&shy;ple, and their man&shy;y con&shy;ten&shy;tions and dis&shy;sen&shy;sions, the Gadianton rob&shy;bers did gain man&shy;y ad&shy;van&shy;tages o&shy;ver them.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>3:22</sup>&#8239;In the sev&shy;en&shy;teenth year, the peo&shy;ple had tak&shy;en their flocks, and their herds, and their grain, and all their sub&shy;stance, and did march forth to the place which had been ap&shy;point&shy;ed that they should gath&shy;er them&shy;selves to&shy;geth&shy;er, to de&shy;fend them&shy;selves a&shy;gainst their enemies.
    <sup>25</sup>&#8239;And they did for&shy;ti&shy;fy them&shy;selves a&shy;gainst their enemies.
    <sup>26</sup>&#8239;And they did make weap&shy;ons of war of eve&shy;ry kind.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>4:1</sup>&#8239;In the eight&shy;eenth year, armies of rob&shy;bers be&shy;gan to take pos&shy;ses&shy;sion of the lands which had been de&shy;sert&shy;ed by the peo&shy;ple, and the cit&shy;ies which had been left des&shy;o&shy;late.
    <sup>4</sup>&#8239;There&shy;fore, there was no chance for the rob&shy;bers to plun&shy;der and to ob&shy;tain food. The peo&shy;ple had re&shy;served for them&shy;selves pro&shy;vi&shy;sions, that they might sub&shy;sist for the space of sev&shy;en years, in the which time they did hope to de&shy;stroy the rob&shy;bers.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>4:18</sup>&#8239;Be&shy;hold, it was im&shy;pos&shy;si&shy;ble for the rob&shy;bers to lay siege sufficiently long to have an&shy;y ef&shy;fect up&shy;on the peo&shy;ple, be&shy;cause of their much pro&shy;vi&shy;sion which they had laid up in store,
    <sup>19</sup>&#8239;And be&shy;cause of the scant&shy;i&shy;ness of pro&shy;vi&shy;sions a&shy;mong the rob&shy;bers,
    <sup>20</sup>&#8239;they were a&shy;bout to per&shy;ish with hun&shy;ger.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>4:27</sup>&#8239;There were man&shy;y thou&shy;sands who did yield them&shy;selves up pris&shy;on&shy;ers, and the re&shy;main&shy;der of them were slain.
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>5:7</sup>&#8239;And thus had the twen&shy;ty-second, twen&shy;ty-third, twen&shy;ty-fourth, and twen&shy;ty-fifth years pas&shy;sed a&shy;way.
    <sup>8</sup>&#8239;And there had man&shy;y things tran&shy;spired which, in the eyes of some, would be great and mar&shy;vel&shy;ous; nev&shy;er&shy;the&shy;less, they can&shy;not all be writ&shy;ten in this book.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>6:1</sup>&#8239;The peo&shy;ple did all re&shy;turn to their own lands in the twen&shy;ty-sixth year, eve&shy;ry man with his fam&shy;i&shy;ly, his flocks and his herds, and all things what&shy;so&shy;ev&shy;er did be&shy;long un&shy;to them.
    <sup>2</sup>&#8239;They had not eat&shy;en up all their pro&shy;vi&shy;sions; there&shy;fore they did take with them all that they had not de&shy;voured, of all their grain, and their gold, and their sil&shy;ver, and they did re&shy;turn to their own lands and their pos&shy;ses&shy;sions.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>6:3</sup>&#8239;They granted un&shy;to those rob&shy;bers who had en&shy;tered in&shy;to a cov&shy;e&shy;nant to keep the peace, lands, that they might have, with their la&shy;bors, where&shy;with to sub&shy;sist up&shy;on; and thus they did es&shy;tab&shy;lish peace in all the land.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>6:4</sup>&#8239;They be&shy;gan a&shy;gain to pros&shy;per; and the twen&shy;ty-seventh year pas&shy;sed a&shy;way, and there was great or&shy;der in the land.
    <sup>5</sup>&#8239;There was noth&shy;ing in all the land to hin&shy;der the peo&shy;ple from prospering con&shy;tin&shy;u&shy;al&shy;ly, ex&shy;cept they should fall in&shy;to trans&shy;gres&shy;sion.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>6:7</sup>&#8239;There were man&shy;y cit&shy;ies built a&shy;new, and there were man&shy;y old cit&shy;ies re&shy;paired.
    <sup>8</sup>&#8239;There were man&shy;y roads made, which led from cit&shy;y to cit&shy;y.
    <sup>9</sup>&#8239;And thus pas&shy;sed a&shy;way the twen&shy;ty-eighth year, and the peo&shy;ple had con&shy;tin&shy;u&shy;al peace.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>6:10</sup>&#8239;In the twen&shy;ty-ninth year there be&shy;gan to be some dis&shy;put&shy;ings a&shy;mong the peo&shy;ple; and some were lifted up un&shy;to pride and boastings be&shy;cause of their ex&shy;ceed&shy;ing&shy;ly great rich&shy;es, yea, e&shy;ven un&shy;to great per&shy;se&shy;cu&shy;tions.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>6:12</sup>&#8239;The peo&shy;ple be&shy;gan to be dis&shy;tin&shy;guished by ranks, ac&shy;cord&shy;ing to their rich&shy;es and their chances for learn&shy;ing, yea, some were ig&shy;no&shy;rant be&shy;cause of their pov&shy;er&shy;ty, and oth&shy;ers did re&shy;ceive great learn&shy;ing be&shy;cause of their rich&shy;es.
    <sup>14</sup>&#8239;And thus there be&shy;came a great in&shy;e&shy;qual&shy;i&shy;ty in all the land, in&shy;so&shy;much that the church be&shy;gan to be bro&shy;ken up.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>6:15</sup>&#8239;Now the cause of this in&shy;iq&shy;ui&shy;ty was this: the peo&shy;ple were puffing up with pride, seek&shy;ing for pow&shy;er, and au&shy;thor&shy;i&shy;ty, and rich&shy;es, and the vain things of the world.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>6:17</sup>&#8239;In the thir&shy;ti&shy;eth year, the peo&shy;ple were in a state of aw&shy;ful wick&shy;ed&shy;ness.
    <sup>18</sup>&#8239;They did not sin ig&shy;no&shy;rant&shy;ly, for they knew the will of God, for it had been taught un&shy;to them. They did wil&shy;ful&shy;ly re&shy;bel a&shy;gainst God.
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>6:20</sup>&#8239;There be&shy;gan to be men in&shy;spired from heav&shy;en and sent forth, preaching of the sins and iniquities of the peo&shy;ple, and tes&shy;ti&shy;fy&shy;ing un&shy;to them con&shy;cern&shy;ing the death, suf&shy;fer&shy;ings, and res&shy;ur&shy;rec&shy;tion of Christ.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>6:23</sup>&#8239;Now there were man&shy;y of those who tes&shy;ti&shy;fied of the things pertaining to Christ who were tak&shy;en and put to death se&shy;cret&shy;ly by the judges.
    <sup>24</sup>&#8239;This was con&shy;tra&shy;ry to the laws of the land,
    <sup>25</sup>&#8239;there&shy;fore a com&shy;plaint came up to the gov&shy;er&shy;nor of the land, a&shy;gainst these judges.
    <sup>26</sup>&#8239;They were tak&shy;en be&shy;fore the judge to be judged ac&shy;cord&shy;ing to the law.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>6:27</sup>&#8239;Those judges had man&shy;y friends and kin&shy;dreds who did gath&shy;er them&shy;selves to&shy;geth&shy;er

    <sup>7:1</sup>&#8239;In the thir&shy;ti&shy;eth year, they did mur&shy;der the chief judge of the land.
    <sup>2</sup>&#8239;And the peo&shy;ple were di&shy;vid&shy;ed one a&shy;gainst an&shy;oth&shy;er.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>7:14</sup>&#8239;In the thir&shy;ty-first year the peo&shy;ple di&shy;vid&shy;ed in&shy;to tribes, eve&shy;ry man ac&shy;cord&shy;ing to his fam&shy;i&shy;ly.  They had come to an a&shy;gree&shy;ment that they would not go to war one with an&shy;oth&shy;er, or tres&shy;pass a&shy;gainst an&shy;oth&shy;er, in&shy;so&shy;much that in some de&shy;gree they had peace in the land; nev&shy;er&shy;the&shy;less, their hearts were turned from God, and they did stone the proph&shy;ets and did cast them out from a&shy;mong them.

</p>

<p>
    <sup>8:5</sup>&#8239;In the thir&shy;ty-fourth year, there a&shy;rose a great storm, such an one as nev&shy;er had been known in all the land.
    <sup>12</sup>&#8239;The whole face of the land was changed, be&shy;cause of the tem&shy;pest and the whirl&shy;winds and the ex&shy;ceed&shy;ing&shy;ly great quak&shy;ing of the whole earth.
    <sup>14</sup>&#8239;Man&shy;y great and no&shy;ta&shy;ble cit&shy;ies were shak&shy;en till the build&shy;ings had fall&shy;en to the earth, and the in&shy;hab&shy;it&shy;ants were slain, and the places were left des&shy;o&shy;late.

<p>
    <sup>8:19</sup>&#8239;When the storm, and the quak&shy;ings of the earth did cease, then be&shy;hold, there was dark&shy;ness up&shy;on the face of the land.
    <sup>22</sup>&#8239;There was not an&shy;y light seen, nei&shy;ther fire, nor glim&shy;mer, nei&shy;ther the sun, nor the moon, nor the stars, for so great were the mists of dark&shy;ness which were up&shy;on the face of the land.

<p>
    <sup>10:12</sup>&#8239;It was the more right&shy;eous part of the peo&shy;ple who were saved, and it was they who re&shy;ceived the proph&shy;ets and stoned them not; and it was they who had not shed the blood of the saints, who were spared.

<p>
    <sup>11:3</sup>&#8239;While they were thus con&shy;vers&shy;ing one with an&shy;oth&shy;er, they heard a voice as if it came out of heav&shy;en.

    <sup>10:19</sup>&#8239;Lib al&shy;so did that which was good in the sight of God.  In the days of Lib the poi&shy;son&shy;ous ser&shy;pents were de&shy;stroyed. Lib al&shy;so be&shy;came a great hunt&shy;er.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>10:29</sup>&#8239;Lib be&shy;gat Hearthom.
    <sup>30</sup>&#8239;Hearthom reigned in the stead of his fa&shy;ther. When Hearthom had reigned twen&shy;ty-four years, the king&shy;dom was tak&shy;en a&shy;way from him. He served man&shy;y years in cap&shy;tiv&shy;i&shy;ty.
    <sup>31</sup>&#8239;His pos&shy;ter&shy;i&shy;ty lived in cap&shy;tiv&shy;i&shy;ty for five gen&shy;er&shy;a&shy;tions, and he had a de&shy;scend&shy;ant Com.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>10:32</sup>&#8239;Com drew a&shy;way half of the king&shy;dom. He reigned o&shy;ver the half of the king&shy;dom for&shy;ty-two years. He went to bat&shy;tle a&shy;gainst the king, and ob&shy;tained pow&shy;er o&shy;ver the re&shy;main&shy;der of the king&shy;dom.

<p>
    <sup>11:1</sup>&#8239;There came al&shy;so in the days of Com man&shy;y proph&shy;ets, and prophesied of the de&shy;struc&shy;tion of that great peo&shy;ple ex&shy;cept they should re&shy;pent.
    <sup>2</sup>&#8239;The proph&shy;ets were re&shy;jected by the peo&shy;ple, and they fled un&shy;to Com for pro&shy;tec&shy;tion, for the peo&shy;ple sought to de&shy;stroy them.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>11:4</sup>&#8239;Com lived to a good old age, and be&shy;gat Shiblom; and Shiblom reigned in his stead. The broth&shy;er of Shiblom rebelled a&shy;gainst him, and there be&shy;gan to be an ex&shy;ceed&shy;ing&shy;ly great war in the land.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>11:5</sup>&#8239;The broth&shy;er of Shiblom caused that all the proph&shy;ets who prophesied of the de&shy;struc&shy;tion of the peo&shy;ple should be put to death.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>11:7</sup>&#8239;There be&shy;gan to be wars and con&shy;ten&shy;tions in the land, and al&shy;so man&shy;y fam&shy;ines and pes&shy;ti&shy;lences, in&shy;so&shy;much that there was a great de&shy;struc&shy;tion. All this came to pas&shy;s in the days of Shiblom.
    <sup>8</sup>&#8239;And the peo&shy;ple be&shy;gan to re&shy;pent of their in&shy;iq&shy;ui&shy;ty.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>11:9</sup>&#8239;Shiblom was slain, and his son Seth was brought in&shy;to cap&shy;tiv&shy;i&shy;ty, and did dwell in cap&shy;tiv&shy;i&shy;ty all his days.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>11:10</sup>&#8239;Ahah, his son, did ob&shy;tain the king&shy;dom, and did all man&shy;ner of in&shy;iq&shy;ui&shy;ty in his days, by which he did cause the shed&shy;ding of much blood. Few were his days.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>11:11</sup>&#8239;Ethem, be&shy;ing a de&shy;scend&shy;ant of Ahah, did ob&shy;tain the king&shy;dom; and he al&shy;so did that which was wick&shy;ed in his days.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>11:12</sup>&#8239;In the days of Ethem there came man&shy;y proph&shy;ets, and prophesied a&shy;gain un&shy;to the peo&shy;ple.
    <sup>13</sup>&#8239;The peo&shy;ple har&shy;dened their hearts, and would not heark&shy;en un&shy;to their words. The proph&shy;ets mourned and with&shy;drew from a&shy;mong the peo&shy;ple.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>11:14</sup>&#8239;Mo&shy;ron, son of Ethem, did reign in his stead. Mo&shy;ron did that which was wick&shy;ed be&shy;fore God.

<h2 id="moroni">Moroni</h2>
<p>
    <sup>7:1</sup>&#8239;I, Moroni, write a few of the words of my fa&shy;ther Mormon, for af&shy;ter this man&shy;ner did he speak un&shy;to the peo&shy;ple.
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>7:2</sup>&#8239;I, Mormon, speak un&shy;to you, my be&shy;lov&shy;ed breth&shy;ren.
    <sup>5</sup>&#8239;I re&shy;mem&shy;ber the word of God, which saith by their works ye shall know them; for if their works be good, then they are good al&shy;so.
    <sup>6</sup>&#8239;For be&shy;hold, God hath sa&shy;id, a man be&shy;ing e&shy;vil can&shy;not do that which is good; for if he offereth a gift, or prayeth un&shy;to God, ex&shy;cept he shall do it with re&shy;al in&shy;tent it profiteth him noth&shy;ing.
    <sup>7</sup>&#8239;For be&shy;hold, it is not counted un&shy;to him for right&shy;eous&shy;ness.
    <sup>8</sup>&#8239;For be&shy;hold, if a man be&shy;ing e&shy;vil giveth a gift, he do&shy;eth it grudg&shy;ing&shy;ly; where&shy;fore it is counted un&shy;to him the same as if he had re&shy;tained the gift; where&shy;fore he is counted e&shy;vil be&shy;fore God.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>7:9</sup>&#8239;Like&shy;wise al&shy;so is it counted e&shy;vil un&shy;to a man, if he shall pray and not with re&shy;al in&shy;tent of heart; yea, and it profiteth him noth&shy;ing, for God receiveth none such.
    <sup>10</sup>&#8239;Where&shy;fore, a man be&shy;ing e&shy;vil can&shy;not do that which is good.
    <sup>11</sup>&#8239;For be&shy;hold, a bit&shy;ter foun&shy;tain can&shy;not bring forth good wa&shy;ter; nei&shy;ther can a good foun&shy;tain bring forth bit&shy;ter wa&shy;ter.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>7:13</sup>&#8239;Be&shy;hold, that which is of God inviteth and enticeth to do good con&shy;tin&shy;u&shy;al&shy;ly; where&shy;fore, eve&shy;ry thing which inviteth and enticeth to do good, and to love God, and to serve him, is in&shy;spired of God.
    <sup>14</sup>&#8239;Where&shy;fore, take heed that ye do not judge that which is e&shy;vil to be of God, or that which is good and of God to be of the dev&shy;il.
    <sup>18</sup>&#8239;See that ye do not judge wrong&shy;ful&shy;ly; for with that same judg&shy;ment which ye judge ye shall al&shy;so be judged.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>7:23</sup>&#8239;God de&shy;clared un&shy;to proph&shy;ets that Christ should come.
    <sup>24</sup>&#8239;And be&shy;hold, there were di&shy;vers ways that he did man&shy;i&shy;fest things un&shy;to the chil&shy;dren of men, which were good.
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>7:44</sup>&#8239;If a man have not char&shy;i&shy;ty he is noth&shy;ing; where&shy;fore he must needs have char&shy;i&shy;ty.
    <sup>45</sup>&#8239;And char&shy;i&shy;ty suffereth long, and is kind, and envieth not, and is not puffed up, seeketh not her own, is not eas&shy;i&shy;ly pro&shy;voked, thinketh no e&shy;vil, and rejoiceth not in in&shy;iq&shy;ui&shy;ty but rejoiceth in the truth, beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>7:46</sup>&#8239;Where&shy;fore, my be&shy;lov&shy;ed breth&shy;ren, if ye have not char&shy;i&shy;ty, ye are noth&shy;ing, for char&shy;i&shy;ty nev&shy;er faileth. Where&shy;fore, cleave un&shy;to char&shy;i&shy;ty, which is the great&shy;est of all, for all things must fail,
    <sup>47</sup>&#8239;but char&shy;i&shy;ty endureth for&shy;ev&shy;er; and who&shy;so is found pos&shy;sessed of it at the last day, it shall be well with him.
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>10:1</sup>&#8239;Now I, Moroni, write some&shy;what as seemeth me good.
    <sup>3</sup>&#8239;Be&shy;hold, I would ex&shy;hort you that when ye shall read these things, that ye would re&shy;mem&shy;ber how mer&shy;ci&shy;ful God hath been un&shy;to the chil&shy;dren of men, and pon&shy;der it in your hearts.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>10:8</sup>&#8239;I ex&shy;hort you, my breth&shy;ren, that ye de&shy;ny not the gifts of God, for they are man&shy;y; and they come from the same God.  And there are dif&shy;fer&shy;ent ways that these gifts are ad&shy;min&shy;is&shy;tered;  but it is the same God who worketh all in all; and they are giv&shy;en to prof&shy;it men.
    <sup>9</sup>&#8239;For be&shy;hold, to one is giv&shy;en, that he may teach the word of wis&shy;dom;
    <sup>10</sup>&#8239;And to an&shy;oth&shy;er, that he may teach the word of knowl&shy;edge.
    <sup>11</sup>&#8239;And to an&shy;oth&shy;er, ex&shy;ceed&shy;ing&shy;ly great faith; and to an&shy;oth&shy;er, the gifts of heal&shy;ing;
    <sup>12</sup>&#8239;And to an&shy;oth&shy;er, that he may work might&shy;y mir&shy;a&shy;cles;
    <sup>13</sup>&#8239;And to an&shy;oth&shy;er, that he may proph&shy;e&shy;sy con&shy;cern&shy;ing all things;
    <sup>14</sup>&#8239;And to an&shy;oth&shy;er, the be&shy;hold&shy;ing of an&shy;gels and ministering spir&shy;its;
    <sup>15</sup>&#8239;And to an&shy;oth&shy;er, all kinds of tongues;
    <sup>16</sup>&#8239;And to an&shy;oth&shy;er, the in&shy;ter&shy;pre&shy;ta&shy;tion of lan&shy;guages.
    <sup>17</sup>&#8239;And all these gifts come un&shy;to eve&shy;ry man sev&shy;er&shy;al&shy;ly, ac&shy;cord&shy;ing as he will.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>10:21</sup>&#8239;Ex&shy;cept ye have char&shy;i&shy;ty ye can in no&shy;wise be saved; nei&shy;ther can ye be saved if ye have not faith; nei&shy;ther can ye if ye have no hope.
    <sup>22</sup>&#8239;And if ye have no hope ye must needs be in de&shy;spair; and de&shy;spair com&shy;eth be&shy;cause of in&shy;iq&shy;ui&shy;ty.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>10:34</sup>&#8239;Now I bid un&shy;to all, fare&shy;well. I soon go to rest in the par&shy;a&shy;dise of God.
