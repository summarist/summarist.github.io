    <sup>1:1</sup>&#8239;Con&shy;fu&shy;cius said, <q>Isn&#x02BC;t it a pleas&shy;ure to learn some&shy;thing, then to ap&shy;ply it at the right time?  Isn&#x02BC;t it a joy to have friends come from a&shy;far?  Isn&#x02BC;t he a su&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;or man who takes no of&shy;fense when his mer&shy;its are ig&shy;nored?</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>1:2</sup>&#8239;Mas&shy;ter You said, <q>A su&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;or man works on the root, for once the root is es&shy;tab&shy;lished, the Way will grow from it.  Isn&#x02BC;t re&shy;spect for par&shy;ents and el&shy;ders the root of be&shy;nev&shy;o&shy;lence?</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>1:3</sup>&#8239;Con&shy;fu&shy;cius said, <q>Cun&shy;ning words and an in&shy;gra&shy;ti&shy;at&shy;ing ap&shy;pear&shy;ance rare&shy;ly ac&shy;com&shy;pa&shy;ny be&shy;nev&shy;o&shy;lence.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>1:4</sup>&#8239;Mas&shy;ter Zeng said, <q>Each day I ex&shy;am&shy;ine my&shy;self on three points. When deal&shy;ing on be&shy;half of oth&shy;ers, have I been loy&shy;al?  In my in&shy;ter&shy;ac&shy;tions with friends, have I been trust&shy;wor&shy;thy?  Have I prac&shy;tised what I was taught?</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>1:5</sup>&#8239;Con&shy;fu&shy;cius said, <q>The Way to guide a state of a thou&shy;sand char&shy;i&shy;ots: be at&shy;ten&shy;tive to busi&shy;ness and trust&shy;wor&shy;thy; be fru&shy;gal in ex&shy;pend&shy;i&shy;tures and love your fel&shy;low men; on&shy;ly mo&shy;bi&shy;lize the com&shy;mon peo&shy;ple at the prop&shy;er time of year.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>1:6</sup>&#8239;Con&shy;fu&shy;cius said, <q>A young man should re&shy;spect his par&shy;ents at home, re&shy;spect his el&shy;ders a&shy;broad, say lit&shy;tle but be trust&shy;wor&shy;thy, love the peo&shy;ple at large but be in&shy;ti&shy;mate with the be&shy;nev&shy;o&shy;lent. If he still has en&shy;er&shy;gy to spare, let him stud&shy;y lit&shy;er&shy;a&shy;ture.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>1:7</sup>&#8239;Zixia said, <q>Oth&shy;ers may say that a man is un&shy;ed&shy;u&shy;cat&shy;ed, but I call him ed&shy;u&shy;cat&shy;ed if he val&shy;ues vir&shy;tue more than beau&shy;ty, ex&shy;erts his ut&shy;most when serv&shy;ing his par&shy;ents, of&shy;fers his whole per&shy;son when serv&shy;ing his lord, and is trust&shy;wor&shy;thy when speak&shy;ing with friends.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>1:10</sup>&#8239;Ziqin asked Zigong, <q>When our Mas&shy;ter ar&shy;rives in a coun&shy;try, he al&shy;ways learns a&shy;bout its gov&shy;ern&shy;ment.  Does he seek out this in&shy;for&shy;ma&shy;tion or is it giv&shy;en to him?</q>  Zigong replied, <q>Our Mas&shy;ter ob&shy;tains it by be&shy;ing cor&shy;dial, up&shy;right, re&shy;spect&shy;ful, fru&shy;gal, and def&shy;er&shy;en&shy;tial. Our Mas&shy;ter seeks it dif&shy;fer&shy;ent&shy;ly than oth&shy;er men do.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>1:14</sup>&#8239;Con&shy;fu&shy;cius said, <q>A su&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;or man seeks nei&shy;ther a full stom&shy;ach nor com&shy;fort&shy;a&shy;ble lodg&shy;ings.  He is dil&shy;i&shy;gent in his ac&shy;tions but cau&shy;tious in his speech.  He as&shy;so&shy;ci&shy;ates with those who know the Way in or&shy;der to be put right.  Such a man may be said to love learn&shy;ing.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>1:15</sup>&#8239;Zigong asked, <q>What do you think of the say&shy;ing, <q>Poor with&shy;out grov&shy;el&shy;ing, rich with&shy;out ar&shy;ro&shy;gance</q>?</q> The Mas&shy;ter replied, <q>Not bad, but bet&shy;ter still, <q>Poor but enjoying the Way, rich but lov&shy;ing pro&shy;pri&shy;e&shy;ty.</q></q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>1:16</sup>&#8239;Con&shy;fu&shy;cius said, <q>Don&#x02BC;t wor&shy;ry that men don&#x02BC;t rec&shy;og&shy;nize your mer&shy;its; wor&shy;ry that you don&#x02BC;t rec&shy;og&shy;nize theirs.</q>

<p>
    <sup>2:1</sup>&#8239;Con&shy;fu&shy;cius said, <q>He who gov&shy;erns by vir&shy;tue is like the North Star: it stays in its place while all the oth&shy;er stars pay hom&shy;age to it.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:3</sup>&#8239;Con&shy;fu&shy;cius said, <q>Lead the peo&shy;ple with e&shy;dicts, keep them or&shy;der&shy;ly with pun&shy;ish&shy;ments: they will e&shy;vade the pun&shy;ish&shy;ment and have no sense of shame.  Lead them with vir&shy;tue, keep them or&shy;der&shy;ly with pro&shy;pri&shy;e&shy;ty: they will have a sense of shame and or&shy;der them&shy;selves.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:6</sup>&#8239;Meng Wubo asked a&shy;bout fil&shy;ial pi&shy;e&shy;ty. Con&shy;fu&shy;cius said, <q>Give your par&shy;ents noth&shy;ing to wor&shy;ry a&shy;bout oth&shy;er than ill&shy;ness.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:7</sup>&#8239;Ziyou asked a&shy;bout fil&shy;ial pi&shy;e&shy;ty. Con&shy;fu&shy;cius said, <q>Now&shy;a&shy;days fil&shy;ial pi&shy;e&shy;ty on&shy;ly means be&shy;ing a&shy;ble to feed your par&shy;ents.  But e&shy;ven dogs and hors&shy;es re&shy;ceive this much care.  With&shy;out re&shy;spect, what&#x02BC;s the dif&shy;fer&shy;ence?</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:8</sup>&#8239;Zixia asked a&shy;bout fil&shy;ial pi&shy;e&shy;ty. Con&shy;fu&shy;cius said, <q>It&#x02BC;s the ex&shy;pres&shy;sion on your face that&#x02BC;s dif&shy;fi&shy;cult to man&shy;age.  It&#x02BC;s not fil&shy;ial pi&shy;e&shy;ty mere&shy;ly for the young to shoul&shy;der the bur&shy;den when there is work to do, and to de&shy;fer to their el&shy;ders when there is wine and food a&shy;vail&shy;a&shy;ble.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:10</sup>&#8239;Con&shy;fu&shy;cius said, <q>Look at the means a man em&shy;ploys.  Ob&shy;serve his mo&shy;tives. Ex&shy;am&shy;ine what gives him com&shy;fort.  How can a man con&shy;ceal his char&shy;ac&shy;ter?</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:11</sup>&#8239;Con&shy;fu&shy;cius said, <q>If a man learns the new by reviewing the old, he is wor&shy;thy to be a teach&shy;er.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:13</sup>&#8239;Zigong asked a&shy;bout the su&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;or man. Con&shy;fu&shy;cius said, <q>He acts be&shy;fore he speaks, and then speaks ac&shy;cord&shy;ing to his ac&shy;tions.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:14</sup>&#8239;Con&shy;fu&shy;cius said, <q>A su&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;or man is in&shy;clu&shy;sive and not par&shy;ti&shy;san.  An in&shy;fe&shy;ri&shy;or man is par&shy;ti&shy;san and not in&shy;clu&shy;sive.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:15</sup>&#8239;Con&shy;fu&shy;cius said, <q>Learn&shy;ing with&shy;out think&shy;ing is a waste.  Think&shy;ing with&shy;out learn&shy;ing is dan&shy;ger&shy;ous.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:17</sup>&#8239;Con&shy;fu&shy;cius said, <q>Knowl&shy;edge is to know when you know some&shy;thing, and to know when you don&#x02BC;t.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:18</sup>&#8239;Zizhang was stud&shy;y&shy;ing in or&shy;der to get an of&shy;fi&shy;cial po&shy;si&shy;tion. Con&shy;fu&shy;cius said, <q>If you lis&shy;ten much, put a&shy;side what is doubt&shy;ful, and speak cau&shy;tious&shy;ly a&shy;bout the rest, you will make few mis&shy;takes.  If you ob&shy;serve much, put a&shy;side what is per&shy;i&shy;lous, and act cau&shy;tious&shy;ly on the rest, you will have few re&shy;grets.  Few mis&shy;takes in speech, few re&shy;grets in ac&shy;tion: an of&shy;fi&shy;cial po&shy;si&shy;tion will fol&shy;low.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:19</sup>&#8239;Duke A&shy;i asked, <q>What should I do so that the peo&shy;ple fol&shy;low me?</q> Con&shy;fu&shy;cius said, <q>If you raise up the straight and place them o&shy;ver the crook&shy;ed, the peo&shy;ple will fol&shy;low you.  If you raise up the crook&shy;ed and place them o&shy;ver the straight, the peo&shy;ple will not fol&shy;low you.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:20</sup>&#8239;Ji Kangzi asked, <q>How can I en&shy;cour&shy;age the peo&shy;ple to be re&shy;spect&shy;ful, loy&shy;al, and dil&shy;i&shy;gent?</q>  Con&shy;fu&shy;cius said, <q>Ap&shy;proach them with dig&shy;ni&shy;ty then they will be re&shy;spect&shy;ful.  Be fil&shy;ial and kind then they will be loy&shy;al.  Raise up the good and in&shy;struct the in&shy;com&shy;pe&shy;tent then they will be dil&shy;i&shy;gent.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:21</sup>&#8239;Some&shy;one asked Con&shy;fu&shy;cius, <q>Why don&#x02BC;t you en&shy;gage in gov&shy;ern&shy;ment?</q> Con&shy;fu&shy;cius said, <q>The Book of Doc&shy;u&shy;ments says, <q>Just by be&shy;ing fil&shy;ial and be&shy;ing friend&shy;ly to your broth&shy;ers you will have an ef&shy;fect on gov&shy;ern&shy;ment.</q>  Since this is al&shy;so en&shy;gag&shy;ing in gov&shy;ern&shy;ment, why do I need to <q>en&shy;gage in gov&shy;ern&shy;ment</q>?</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:22</sup>&#8239;Con&shy;fu&shy;cius said, <q>I don&#x02BC;t know what to do with an un&shy;trust&shy;wor&shy;thy man. How can you pull a wag&shy;on that&#x02BC;s mis&shy;sing its yoke pin?</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:24</sup>&#8239;Con&shy;fu&shy;cius said, <q>To sac&shy;ri&shy;fice to an&shy;ces&shy;tral spir&shy;its oth&shy;er than your own is flat&shy;ter&shy;y.  To see what is right and not to do it is a lack of cour&shy;age.</q>
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>3:3</sup>&#8239;Con&shy;fu&shy;cius said, <q>If a man is not be&shy;nev&shy;o&shy;lent, what can he do with pro&shy;pri&shy;e&shy;ty?</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>3:4</sup>&#8239;Con&shy;fu&shy;cius said, <q>In rit&shy;u&shy;al, pre&shy;fer fru&shy;gal&shy;i&shy;ty to ex&shy;trav&shy;a&shy;gance.  In fu&shy;ner&shy;als, pre&shy;fer grief to for&shy;mal&shy;i&shy;ty.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>3:7</sup>&#8239;Con&shy;fu&shy;cius said, <q>A su&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;or man is not com&shy;pet&shy;i&shy;tive. If he must com&shy;pete, let it be at ar&shy;cher&shy;y.  He as&shy;cends to his po&shy;si&shy;tion and bows in def&shy;er&shy;ence.  Af&shy;ter&shy;wards, he de&shy;scends and drinks a sa&shy;lute.  E&shy;ven in com&shy;pe&shy;ti&shy;tion he is a su&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;or man.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>3:12</sup>&#8239;Con&shy;fu&shy;cius said, <q>If I don&#x02BC;t par&shy;tic&shy;i&shy;pate in a sac&shy;ri&shy;fice, it&#x02BC;s as if I have not sacrificed at all.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>3:15</sup>&#8239;When Con&shy;fu&shy;cius en&shy;tered the Grand Tem&shy;ple, he asked ques&shy;tions a&shy;bout eve&shy;ry&shy;thing. Some&shy;one re&shy;marked, <q>Who says that Con&shy;fu&shy;cius knows a&shy;bout rit&shy;u&shy;al? When visiting the Grand Tem&shy;ple, he asked ques&shy;tions a&shy;bout eve&shy;ry&shy;thing.</q> Con&shy;fu&shy;cius, hear&shy;ing this, said, <q>This is the rit&shy;u&shy;al.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>3:21</sup>&#8239;Con&shy;fu&shy;cius said, <q>Don&#x02BC;t ex&shy;plain a&shy;way what is al&shy;read&shy;y done.  Don&#x02BC;t ar&shy;gue a&shy;gainst what is al&shy;read&shy;y ac&shy;com&shy;plished.  Don&#x02BC;t as&shy;sign blame for what is al&shy;read&shy;y past.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>3:26</sup>&#8239;Con&shy;fu&shy;cius said, <q>Hold&shy;ing a high po&shy;si&shy;tion with&shy;out tol&shy;er&shy;ance, per&shy;form&shy;ing rit&shy;u&shy;al with&shy;out rev&shy;er&shy;ence, joining a fu&shy;ner&shy;al with&shy;out grief: how can I look at such things?</q>
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>4:1</sup>&#8239;Con&shy;fu&shy;cius said, <q>It is be&shy;nev&shy;o&shy;lence that makes a neigh&shy;bor&shy;hood beau&shy;ti&shy;ful. How can a man be con&shy;sid&shy;ered wise if he chooses not to re&shy;side a&shy;mong be&shy;nev&shy;o&shy;lence?</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>4:2</sup>&#8239;Con&shy;fu&shy;cius said, <q>Those who lack be&shy;nev&shy;o&shy;lence can en&shy;dure nei&shy;ther ad&shy;ver&shy;si&shy;ty nor en&shy;joy&shy;ment for long. The be&shy;nev&shy;o&shy;lent are con&shy;tent with be&shy;nev&shy;o&shy;lence. The wise cul&shy;ti&shy;vate be&shy;nev&shy;o&shy;lence for its ad&shy;van&shy;tage.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>4:4</sup>&#8239;Con&shy;fu&shy;cius said, <q>If you set your heart on be&shy;nev&shy;o&shy;lence, you will be free from evil.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>4:5</sup>&#8239;Con&shy;fu&shy;cius said, <q>All men de&shy;sire wealth and hon&shy;or, but if they are ob&shy;tained by not fol&shy;low&shy;ing the Way, they should not be kept. All men hate pov&shy;er&shy;ty and dis&shy;grace, but if they can&#x02BC;t be a&shy;voided by fol&shy;low&shy;ing the Way, they should not be a&shy;voided.  If a su&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;or man a&shy;ban&shy;dons be&shy;nev&shy;o&shy;lence, how is he wor&shy;thy of that name?  A su&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;or man nev&shy;er leaves be&shy;nev&shy;o&shy;lence e&shy;ven for the space of a sin&shy;gle meal.  In mo&shy;ments of haste, he acts ac&shy;cord&shy;ing to it.  In times of dif&shy;fi&shy;cul&shy;ty, he acts ac&shy;cord&shy;ing to it.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>4:6</sup>&#8239;Con&shy;fu&shy;cius said, <q>One who re&shy;al&shy;ly loves be&shy;nev&shy;o&shy;lence puts noth&shy;ing a&shy;bove it. One who re&shy;al&shy;ly hates what is not be&shy;nev&shy;o&shy;lent would not al&shy;low it to ap&shy;proach him.  Has any&shy;one de&shy;vot&shy;ed all his strength to be&shy;nev&shy;o&shy;lence for a sin&shy;gle day?  I hav&shy;en&#x02BC;t seen any&shy;one who lacked the strength to do so.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>4:7</sup>&#8239;Con&shy;fu&shy;cius said, <q>Peo&shy;ple make er&shy;rors ac&shy;cord&shy;ing to the type of per&shy;son they are.  Ob&shy;serve their er&shy;rors and you can know their de&shy;gree of be&shy;nev&shy;o&shy;lence.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>4:9</sup>&#8239;Con&shy;fu&shy;cius said, <q>A gen&shy;tle&shy;man who sets his heart on the Way, but is a&shy;shamed of poor clothes and poor food, is not worth en&shy;gag&shy;ing in dis&shy;cus&shy;sion.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>4:10</sup>&#8239;Con&shy;fu&shy;cius said, <q>When a su&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;or man deals with the world he is not in&shy;var&shy;i&shy;a&shy;bly for or a&shy;gainst any&shy;thing.  He sides with what is right.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>4:11</sup>&#8239;Con&shy;fu&shy;cius said, <q>A su&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;or man cherishes vir&shy;tue; an in&shy;fe&shy;ri&shy;or man cherishes land.  A su&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;or man cherishes jus&shy;tice; an in&shy;fe&shy;ri&shy;or man cherishes fa&shy;vors.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>4:12</sup>&#8239;Con&shy;fu&shy;cius said, <q>One who acts out of per&shy;son&shy;al prof&shy;it in&shy;curs much re&shy;sent&shy;ment.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>4:14</sup>&#8239;Con&shy;fu&shy;cius said, <q>Don&#x02BC;t wor&shy;ry that you have no po&shy;si&shy;tion; wor&shy;ry a&shy;bout what it takes to mer&shy;it one.  Don&#x02BC;t wor&shy;ry that no one knows you; seek to be worth know&shy;ing.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>4:16</sup>&#8239;Con&shy;fu&shy;cius said, <q>A su&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;or man un&shy;der&shy;stands what is right.  An in&shy;fe&shy;ri&shy;or man un&shy;der&shy;stands per&shy;son&shy;al prof&shy;it.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>4:17</sup>&#8239;Con&shy;fu&shy;cius said, <q>When you see a wor&shy;thy man, think of be&shy;com&shy;ing his e&shy;qual; when you see an un&shy;wor&shy;thy man, look with&shy;in and ex&shy;am&shy;ine your&shy;self.</q>

I can&#x02BC;t hope to meet a tru&shy;ly good man, but I would be con&shy;tent to meet a stead&shy;fast man.  It is hard to be stead&shy;fast when noth&shy;ing pre&shy;tends to be some&shy;thing, emp&shy;ti&shy;ness pre&shy;tends to be full&shy;ness, and pov&shy;er&shy;ty pre&shy;tends to be com&shy;fort.</q>

<p>
    <sup>7:27</sup>&#8239;Con&shy;fu&shy;cius fished with a line, but didn&#x02BC;t use a net.  He hunt&shy;ed, but didn&#x02BC;t shoot roosting birds.

<p>
    <sup>7:28</sup>&#8239;Con&shy;fu&shy;cius said, <q>There may be those who can act with&shy;out knowl&shy;edge, but I am not one of them.  I hear much, se&shy;lect what is good, and fol&shy;low it.  I see much, and re&shy;mem&shy;ber it.  This is the sec&shy;ond lev&shy;el of knowl&shy;edge.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>7:29</sup>&#8239;Con&shy;fu&shy;cius said, <q>To ap&shy;prove of a man&#x02BC;s vis&shy;it does not mean ap&shy;prov&shy;ing of what he does af&shy;ter he leaves.  Why be so se&shy;vere?  When a man purifies him&shy;self to ap&shy;proach me, I ap&shy;prove of his pu&shy;ri&shy;ty with&shy;out en&shy;dors&shy;ing his past or his fu&shy;ture.</q>

<p>
    <sup>7:34</sup>&#8239;Con&shy;fu&shy;cius said, <q>How would I dare claim to be be&shy;nev&shy;o&shy;lent or a sage? Rath&shy;er, it may be said that I strive for them with&shy;out flag&shy;ging, and teach oth&shy;ers with&shy;out wea&shy;ri&shy;ness.</q>

    <sup>8:2</sup>&#8239;Con&shy;fu&shy;cius said, <q>Cour&shy;te&shy;sy with&shy;out pro&shy;pri&shy;e&shy;ty is tire&shy;some.
