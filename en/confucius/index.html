    <sup>1:1</sup>&#8239;The Mas&shy;ter said, &#x02BC;Is it not pleas&shy;ant to learn with a con&shy;stant per&shy;se&shy;ver&shy;ance and ap&shy;pli&shy;ca&shy;tion?  &#x02BC;Is it not de&shy;light&shy;ful to have friends com&shy;ing from dis&shy;tant quar&shy;ters?&#x02BC; &#x02BC;Is he not a man of com&shy;plete vir&shy;tue, who feels no dis&shy;com&shy;po&shy;sure though men may take no note of him?&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>1:2</sup>&#8239;The phi&shy;los&shy;o&shy;pher Yu said, &#x02BC;They are few who, be&shy;ing fil&shy;ial and fra&shy;ter&shy;nal, are fond of offending a&shy;gainst their su&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;ors.  There have been none, who, not lik&shy;ing to of&shy;fend a&shy;gainst their su&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;ors, have been fond of stir&shy;ring up con&shy;fu&shy;sion.  &#x02BC;The su&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;or man bends his at&shy;ten&shy;tion to what is rad&shy;i&shy;cal.  That be&shy;ing es&shy;tab&shy;lished, all prac&shy;ti&shy;cal cours&shy;es nat&shy;u&shy;ral&shy;ly grow up. Fil&shy;ial pi&shy;e&shy;ty and fra&shy;ter&shy;nal sub&shy;mis&shy;sion!-- are they not the root of all be&shy;nev&shy;o&shy;lent ac&shy;tions?&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>1:3</sup>&#8239;The Mas&shy;ter said, &#x02BC;Fine words and an in&shy;sin&shy;u&shy;at&shy;ing ap&shy;pear&shy;ance are sel&shy;dom as&shy;so&shy;ci&shy;at&shy;ed with true vir&shy;tue.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>1:4</sup>&#8239;The phi&shy;los&shy;o&shy;pher Tsang said, &#x02BC;I dai&shy;ly ex&shy;am&shy;ine my&shy;self on three points:-- wheth&shy;er, in transacting busi&shy;ness for oth&shy;ers, I may have been not faith&shy;ful;-- wheth&shy;er, in in&shy;ter&shy;course with friends, I may have been not sin&shy;cere;-- wheth&shy;er I may have not mas&shy;tered and prac&shy;tised the in&shy;struc&shy;tions of my teach&shy;er.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>1:5</sup>&#8239;The Mas&shy;ter said, To rule a coun&shy;try of a thou&shy;sand char&shy;i&shy;ots, there must be rev&shy;er&shy;ent at&shy;ten&shy;tion to busi&shy;ness, and sin&shy;cer&shy;i&shy;ty; e&shy;con&shy;o&shy;my in ex&shy;pend&shy;i&shy;ture, and love for men; and the em&shy;ploy&shy;ment of the peo&shy;ple at the prop&shy;er sea&shy;sons.&#x02BC; 
    <sup>6</sup>&#8239;The Mas&shy;ter said, &#x02BC;A youth, when at home, should be fil&shy;ial, and, a&shy;broad, re&shy;spect&shy;ful to his el&shy;ders. He should be ear&shy;nest and truth&shy;ful. He should o&shy;ver&shy;flow in love to all, and cul&shy;ti&shy;vate the friend&shy;ship of the good. When he has time and op&shy;por&shy;tu&shy;ni&shy;ty, af&shy;ter the per&shy;for&shy;mance of these things, he should em&shy;ploy them in po&shy;lite stud&shy;ies.&#x02BC; 
    <sup>7</sup>&#8239;Tsze-hsia said, &#x02BC;If a man with&shy;draws his mind from the love of beau&shy;ty, and applies it as sin&shy;cere&shy;ly to the love of the vir&shy;tu&shy;ous; if, in serv&shy;ing his par&shy;ents, he can ex&shy;ert his ut&shy;most strength;  if, in serv&shy;ing his prince, he can de&shy;vote his life; if, in his in&shy;ter&shy;course with his friends, his words are sin&shy;cere:-- al&shy;though men say that he has not learn&shy;ed, I will cer&shy;tain&shy;ly say that he has.&#x02BC; 
    <sup>8</sup>&#8239;The Mas&shy;ter said, &#x02BC;If the schol&shy;ar be not gra&shy;ve, he will not call forth any ven&shy;er&shy;a&shy;tion, and his learn&shy;ing will not be sol&shy;id.  &#x02BC;Hold faith&shy;ful&shy;ness and sin&shy;cer&shy;i&shy;ty as first prin&shy;ci&shy;ples.  &#x02BC;Have no friends not e&shy;qual to your&shy;self.  &#x02BC;When you have faults, do not fear to a&shy;ban&shy;don them.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>1:9</sup>&#8239;The phi&shy;los&shy;o&shy;pher Tsang said, &#x02BC;Let there be a care&shy;ful at&shy;ten&shy;tion to per&shy;form the fu&shy;ner&shy;al rites to par&shy;ents, and let them be fol&shy;lowed when long gone with the ceremonies of sac&shy;ri&shy;fice;-- then the vir&shy;tue of the peo&shy;ple will re&shy;sume its prop&shy;er ex&shy;cel&shy;lence.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>1:10</sup>&#8239;Tsze-ch&#x02BC;in asked Tsze-kung, say&shy;ing, &#x02BC;When our mas&shy;ter co&shy;mes to any coun&shy;try, he does not fail to learn all a&shy;bout its gov&shy;ern&shy;ment. Does he ask his in&shy;for&shy;ma&shy;tion? or is it giv&shy;en to him?&#x02BC; Tsze-kung said, &#x02BC;Our mas&shy;ter is be&shy;nign, up&shy;right, cour&shy;te&shy;ous, tem&shy;per&shy;ate, and com&shy;plai&shy;sant, and thus he gets his in&shy;for&shy;ma&shy;tion. The mas&shy;ter&#x02BC;s mode of asking in&shy;for&shy;ma&shy;tion!-- is it not dif&shy;fer&shy;ent from that of oth&shy;er men?&#x02BC; 
    <sup>11</sup>&#8239;The Mas&shy;ter said, &#x02BC;While a man&#x02BC;s fa&shy;ther is a&shy;live, look at the bent of his will; when his fa&shy;ther is dead, look at his con&shy;duct.  If for three years he does not al&shy;ter from the way of his fa&shy;ther, he may be called fil&shy;ial.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>1:12</sup>&#8239;The phi&shy;los&shy;o&shy;pher Yu said, &#x02BC;In practising the rules of pro&shy;pri&shy;e&shy;ty, a nat&shy;u&shy;ral ease is to be prized. In the ways pre&shy;scribed by the an&shy;cient kings, this is the ex&shy;cel&shy;lent qual&shy;i&shy;ty, and in things small and great we fol&shy;low them.  &#x02BC;Yet it is not to be ob&shy;served in all cases. If one, know&shy;ing how such ease should be prized, man&shy;i&shy;fests it, with&shy;out reg&shy;u&shy;lat&shy;ing it by the rules of pro&shy;pri&shy;e&shy;ty, this like&shy;wise is not to be done.&#x02BC; 
    <sup>13</sup>&#8239;The phi&shy;los&shy;o&shy;pher Yu said, &#x02BC;When a&shy;gree&shy;ments are made ac&shy;cord&shy;ing to what is right, what is spo&shy;ken can be made good.  When re&shy;spect is shown ac&shy;cord&shy;ing to what is prop&shy;er, one keeps far from shame and dis&shy;grace. When the parties up&shy;on whom a man leans are prop&shy;er per&shy;sons to be in&shy;ti&shy;mate with, he can make them his guides and mas&shy;ters.&#x02BC; 
    <sup>14</sup>&#8239;The Mas&shy;ter said, &#x02BC;He who aims to be a man of com&shy;plete vir&shy;tue in his food does not seek to grat&shy;i&shy;fy his ap&shy;pe&shy;tite, nor in his dwell&shy;ing place does he seek the ap&shy;pli&shy;ances of ease; he is ear&shy;nest in what he is do&shy;ing, and care&shy;ful in his speech; he fre&shy;quents the com&shy;pa&shy;ny of men of prin&shy;ci&shy;ple that he may be rec&shy;ti&shy;fied:-- such a per&shy;son may be said in&shy;deed to love to learn.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>1:15</sup>&#8239;Tsze-kung said, &#x02BC;What do you pro&shy;nounce con&shy;cern&shy;ing the poor man who yet does not flat&shy;ter, and the rich man who is not proud?&#x02BC; The Mas&shy;ter replied, &#x02BC;They will do; but they are not e&shy;qual to him, who, though poor, is yet cheer&shy;ful, and to him, who, though rich, loves the rules of pro&shy;pri&shy;e&shy;ty.&#x02BC; Tsze-kung replied, &#x02BC;It is said in the Book of Po&shy;et&shy;ry, "As you cut and then file, as you carve and then pol&shy;ish."-- The mean&shy;ing is the same, I ap&shy;pre&shy;hend, as that which you have just ex&shy;pressed.&#x02BC; The Mas&shy;ter said, &#x02BC;With one like Ts&#x02BC;ze, I can be&shy;gin to talk a&shy;bout the odes. I told him one point, and he knew its prop&shy;er se&shy;quence.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>1:16</sup>&#8239;The Mas&shy;ter said, &#x02BC;I will not be af&shy;flicted at men&#x02BC;s not know&shy;ing me; I will be af&shy;flicted that I do not know men.&#x02BC;
</p>


<h2 id="book-2">Book 2</h2>
<p>
    <sup>2:1</sup>&#8239;The Mas&shy;ter said, &#x02BC;He who ex&shy;er&shy;cises gov&shy;ern&shy;ment by means of his vir&shy;tue may be com&shy;pared to the north po&shy;lar star, which keeps its place and all the stars turn to&shy;wards it.&#x02BC; 
    <sup>2</sup>&#8239;The Mas&shy;ter said, &#x02BC;In the Book of Po&shy;et&shy;ry are three hun&shy;dred pieces, but the de&shy;sign of them all may be em&shy;braced in one sen&shy;tence-- "Having no de&shy;praved thoughts."&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:3</sup>&#8239;The Mas&shy;ter said, &#x02BC;If the peo&shy;ple be led by laws, and u&shy;ni&shy;form&shy;i&shy;ty sought to be giv&shy;en them by pun&shy;ish&shy;ments, they will try to a&shy;void the pun&shy;ish&shy;ment, but have no sense of shame.  &#x02BC;If they be led by vir&shy;tue, and u&shy;ni&shy;form&shy;i&shy;ty sought to be giv&shy;en them by the rules of pro&shy;pri&shy;e&shy;ty, they will have the sense of shame, and more&shy;o&shy;ver will be&shy;come good.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:4</sup>&#8239;The Mas&shy;ter said, &#x02BC;At fif&shy;teen, I had my mind bent on learn&shy;ing.  &#x02BC;At thir&shy;ty, I stood firm.  &#x02BC;At for&shy;ty, I had no doubts.  &#x02BC;At fif&shy;ty, I knew the de&shy;crees of Heav&shy;en.  &#x02BC;At six&shy;ty, my ear was an o&shy;be&shy;di&shy;ent or&shy;gan for the re&shy;cep&shy;tion of truth.  &#x02BC;At sev&shy;en&shy;ty, I could fol&shy;low what my heart de&shy;sired, with&shy;out transgressing what was right.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:5</sup>&#8239;Mang I asked what fil&shy;ial pi&shy;e&shy;ty was. The Mas&shy;ter said, &#x02BC;It is not be&shy;ing dis&shy;o&shy;be&shy;di&shy;ent.&#x02BC; Soon af&shy;ter, as Fan Ch&#x02BC;ih was driv&shy;ing him, the Mas&shy;ter told him, say&shy;ing, &#x02BC;Mang-sun asked me what fil&shy;ial pi&shy;e&shy;ty was, and I an&shy;swered him,-- "not be&shy;ing dis&shy;o&shy;be&shy;di&shy;ent."&#x02BC; Fan Ch&#x02BC;ih said, &#x02BC;What did you mean?&#x02BC; The Mas&shy;ter replied, &#x02BC;That par&shy;ents, when a&shy;live, be served ac&shy;cord&shy;ing to pro&shy;pri&shy;e&shy;ty; that, when dead, they should be bur&shy;ied ac&shy;cord&shy;ing to pro&shy;pri&shy;e&shy;ty; and that they should be sacrificed to ac&shy;cord&shy;ing to pro&shy;pri&shy;e&shy;ty.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:6</sup>&#8239;Mang Wu asked what fil&shy;ial pi&shy;e&shy;ty was. The Mas&shy;ter said, &#x02BC;Parents are anx&shy;ious lest their chil&shy;dren should be sick.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:7</sup>&#8239;Tsze-yu asked what fil&shy;ial pi&shy;e&shy;ty was. The Mas&shy;ter said, &#x02BC;The fil&shy;ial pi&shy;e&shy;ty of now-a-days means the sup&shy;port of one&#x02BC;s par&shy;ents. But dogs and hors&shy;es like&shy;wise are a&shy;ble to do some&shy;thing in the way of sup&shy;port;-- with&shy;out rev&shy;er&shy;ence, what is there to dis&shy;tin&shy;guish the one sup&shy;port giv&shy;en from the oth&shy;er?&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:8</sup>&#8239;Tsze-hsia asked what fil&shy;ial pi&shy;e&shy;ty was. The Mas&shy;ter said, &#x02BC;The dif&shy;fi&shy;cul&shy;ty is with the coun&shy;te&shy;nance. If, when their el&shy;ders have any trou&shy;ble&shy;some af&shy;fairs, the young take the toil of them, and if, when the young have wine and food, they set them be&shy;fore their el&shy;ders, is THIS to be con&shy;sid&shy;ered fil&shy;ial pi&shy;e&shy;ty?&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:9</sup>&#8239;The Mas&shy;ter said, &#x02BC;I have talked with Hui for a whole day, and he has not made any ob&shy;jec&shy;tion to any&shy;thing I said;-- as if he were stu&shy;pid. He has re&shy;tired, and I have ex&shy;am&shy;ined his con&shy;duct when a&shy;way from me, and found him a&shy;ble to il&shy;lus&shy;trate my teach&shy;ings.  Hui!-- He is not stu&shy;pid.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:10</sup>&#8239;The Mas&shy;ter said, &#x02BC;See what a man does.  &#x02BC;Mark his mo&shy;tives. &#x02BC;Examine in what things he rests.  &#x02BC;How can a man con&shy;ceal his char&shy;ac&shy;ter?  How can a man con&shy;ceal his char&shy;ac&shy;ter?&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:11</sup>&#8239;The Mas&shy;ter said, &#x02BC;If a man keeps cherishing his old knowl&shy;edge, so as con&shy;tin&shy;u&shy;al&shy;ly to be ac&shy;quir&shy;ing new, he may be a teach&shy;er of oth&shy;ers.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:12</sup>&#8239;The Mas&shy;ter said, &#x02BC;The ac&shy;com&shy;plished schol&shy;ar is not a u&shy;ten&shy;sil.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:13</sup>&#8239;Tsze-kung asked what con&shy;sti&shy;tut&shy;ed the su&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;or man. The Mas&shy;ter said, &#x02BC;He acts be&shy;fore he speaks, and af&shy;ter&shy;wards speaks ac&shy;cord&shy;ing to his ac&shy;tions.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:14</sup>&#8239;The Mas&shy;ter said, &#x02BC;The su&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;or man is cath&shy;o&shy;lic and no par&shy;ti&shy;san. The mean man is par&shy;ti&shy;san and not cath&shy;o&shy;lic.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:15</sup>&#8239;The Mas&shy;ter said, &#x02BC;Learning with&shy;out thought is la&shy;bour lost; thought with&shy;out learn&shy;ing is per&shy;i&shy;lous.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:16</sup>&#8239;The Mas&shy;ter said, &#x02BC;The stud&shy;y of strange doc&shy;trines is in&shy;ju&shy;ri&shy;ous in&shy;deed!&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:17</sup>&#8239;The Mas&shy;ter said, &#x02BC;Yu, shall I teach you what knowl&shy;edge is? When you know a thing, to hold that you know it;  and when you do not know a thing, to al&shy;low that you do not know it;-- this is knowl&shy;edge.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:18</sup>&#8239;Tsze-chang was learn&shy;ing with a view to of&shy;fi&shy;cial e&shy;mol&shy;u&shy;ment.  The Mas&shy;ter said, &#x02BC;Hear much and put a&shy;side the points of which you stand in doubt, while you speak cau&shy;tious&shy;ly at the same time of the oth&shy;ers:-- then you will af&shy;ford few oc&shy;ca&shy;sions for blame.  See much and put a&shy;side the things which seem per&shy;i&shy;lous, while you are cau&shy;tious at the same time in car&shy;ry&shy;ing the oth&shy;ers in&shy;to prac&shy;tice:-- then you will have few oc&shy;ca&shy;sions for re&shy;pent&shy;ance. When one gives few oc&shy;ca&shy;sions for blame in his words, and few oc&shy;ca&shy;sions for re&shy;pent&shy;ance in his con&shy;duct, he is in the way to get e&shy;mol&shy;u&shy;ment.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:19</sup>&#8239;The Duke A&shy;i asked, say&shy;ing, &#x02BC;What should be done in or&shy;der to se&shy;cure the sub&shy;mis&shy;sion of the peo&shy;ple?&#x02BC; Confucius replied, &#x02BC;Advance the up&shy;right and set a&shy;side the crook&shy;ed, then the peo&shy;ple will sub&shy;mit. Ad&shy;vance the crook&shy;ed and set a&shy;side the up&shy;right, then the peo&shy;ple will not sub&shy;mit.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:20</sup>&#8239;Chi K&#x02BC;ang asked how to cause the peo&shy;ple to rev&shy;er&shy;ence their rul&shy;er, to be faith&shy;ful to him, and to go on to nerve them&shy;selves to vir&shy;tue. The Mas&shy;ter said, &#x02BC;Let him pre&shy;side o&shy;ver them with grav&shy;i&shy;ty;-- then they will rev&shy;er&shy;ence him. Let him be fil&shy;ial and kind to all;-- then they will be faith&shy;ful to him. Let him ad&shy;vance the good and teach the in&shy;com&shy;pe&shy;tent;-- then they will ea&shy;ger&shy;ly seek to be vir&shy;tu&shy;ous.&#x02BC;

    <sup>2:21</sup>&#8239;Some one ad&shy;dressed Confucius, say&shy;ing, &#x02BC;Sir, why are you not en&shy;gaged in the gov&shy;ern&shy;ment?&#x02BC; The Mas&shy;ter said, &#x02BC;What does the Shu-ching say of fil&shy;ial pi&shy;e&shy;ty?-- "You are fil&shy;ial, you dis&shy;charge your broth&shy;er&shy;ly duties. These qualities are dis&shy;played in gov&shy;ern&shy;ment." This then al&shy;so con&shy;sti&shy;tutes the ex&shy;er&shy;cise of gov&shy;ern&shy;ment. Why must there be THAT-- mak&shy;ing one be in the gov&shy;ern&shy;ment?&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:22</sup>&#8239;The Mas&shy;ter said, &#x02BC;I do not know how a man with&shy;out truthfulness is to get on. How can a large car&shy;riage be made to go with&shy;out the cross-bar for yok&shy;ing the ox&shy;en to, or a small car&shy;riage with&shy;out the ar&shy;range&shy;ment for yok&shy;ing the hors&shy;es?&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:23</sup>&#8239;Tsze-chang asked wheth&shy;er the af&shy;fairs of ten ages af&shy;ter could be known.  Confucius said, &#x02BC;The Yin dyn&shy;as&shy;ty fol&shy;lowed the reg&shy;u&shy;la&shy;tions of the Hsia: where&shy;in it took from or added to them may be known. The Chau dyn&shy;as&shy;ty has fol&shy;lowed the reg&shy;u&shy;la&shy;tions of Yin: where&shy;in it took from or added to them may be known. Some oth&shy;er may fol&shy;low the Chau, but though it should be at the dis&shy;tance of a hun&shy;dred ages, its af&shy;fairs may be known.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:24</sup>&#8239;The Mas&shy;ter said, &#x02BC;For a man to sac&shy;ri&shy;fice to a spir&shy;it which does not be&shy;long to him is flat&shy;ter&shy;y.  &#x02BC;To see what is right and not to do it is want of cour&shy;age.&#x02BC;

    <sup>3:1</sup>&#8239;Confucius said of the head of the Chi fam&shy;i&shy;ly, who had eight rows of pan&shy;to&shy;mimes in his ar&shy;e&shy;a, &#x02BC;If he can bear to do this, what may he not bear to do?&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>3:2</sup>&#8239;The three families used the YUNG ode, while the ves&shy;sels were be&shy;ing re&shy;moved, at the con&shy;clu&shy;sion of the sac&shy;ri&shy;fice. The Mas&shy;ter said, &#x02BC;"Assisting are the prin&shy;ces;-- the son of heav&shy;en looks pro&shy;found and gra&shy;ve:"-- what ap&shy;pli&shy;ca&shy;tion can these words have in the hall of the three families?&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>3:3</sup>&#8239;The Mas&shy;ter said, &#x02BC;If a man be with&shy;out the vir&shy;tues prop&shy;er to hu&shy;man&shy;i&shy;ty, what has he to do with the rites of pro&shy;pri&shy;e&shy;ty?

</p>

<p>
    <sup>3:4</sup>&#8239;Lin Fang asked what was the first thing to be at&shy;tended to in ceremonies.  The Mas&shy;ter said, &#x02BC;A great ques&shy;tion in&shy;deed!  &#x02BC;In fes&shy;tive ceremonies, it is bet&shy;ter to be spar&shy;ing than ex&shy;trav&shy;a&shy;gant. In the ceremonies of mourn&shy;ing, it is bet&shy;ter that there be deep sor&shy;row than a min&shy;ute at&shy;ten&shy;tion to ob&shy;ser&shy;vances.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>3:5</sup>&#8239;The Mas&shy;ter said, &#x02BC;The rude tribes of the east and north have their prin&shy;ces, and are not like the States of our great land which are with&shy;out them.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>3:6</sup>&#8239;The chief of the Chi fam&shy;i&shy;ly was a&shy;bout to sac&shy;ri&shy;fice to the T&#x02BC;ai moun&shy;tain. The Mas&shy;ter said to Zan Yu, &#x02BC;Can you not save him from this?&#x02BC; He an&shy;swered, &#x02BC;I can&shy;not.&#x02BC; Confucius said, &#x02BC;Alas! will you say that the T&#x02BC;ai moun&shy;tain is not so dis&shy;cern&shy;ing as Lin Fang?&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>3:7</sup>&#8239;The Mas&shy;ter said, &#x02BC;The stu&shy;dent of vir&shy;tue has no con&shy;ten&shy;tions. If it be said he can&shy;not a&shy;void them, shall this be in ar&shy;cher&shy;y? But he bows com&shy;plai&shy;sant&shy;ly to his com&shy;pet&shy;i&shy;tors; thus he as&shy;cends the hall, de&shy;scends, and ex&shy;acts the for&shy;feit of drink&shy;ing. In his con&shy;ten&shy;tion, he is still the Chun-tsze.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>3:8</sup>&#8239;Tsze-hsia asked, say&shy;ing, &#x02BC;What is the mean&shy;ing of the pas&shy;sage-- "The pret&shy;ty dim&shy;ples of her art&shy;ful smile! The well- de&shy;fined black and white of her eye! The plain ground for the colours?"&#x02BC; The Mas&shy;ter said, &#x02BC;The busi&shy;ness of lay&shy;ing on the colours fol&shy;lows (the prep&shy;a&shy;ra&shy;tion of) the plain ground.&#x02BC; &#x02BC;Ceremonies then are a sub&shy;se&shy;quent thing?&#x02BC; The Mas&shy;ter said, &#x02BC;It is Shang who can bring out my mean&shy;ing. Now I can be&shy;gin to talk a&shy;bout the odes with him.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>3:9</sup>&#8239;The Mas&shy;ter said, &#x02BC;I could de&shy;scribe the ceremonies of the Hsia dyn&shy;as&shy;ty, but Chi can&shy;not sufficiently at&shy;test my words. I could de&shy;scribe the ceremonies of the Yin dyn&shy;as&shy;ty, but Sung can&shy;not sufficiently at&shy;test my words. (They can&shy;not do so) be&shy;cause of the in&shy;suf&shy;fi&shy;cien&shy;cy of their re&shy;cords and wise men. If those were suf&shy;fi&shy;cient, I could ad&shy;duce them in sup&shy;port of my words.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>3:10</sup>&#8239;The Mas&shy;ter said, &#x02BC;At the great sac&shy;ri&shy;fice, af&shy;ter the pouring out of the li&shy;ba&shy;tion, I have no wish to look on.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>3:11</sup>&#8239;Some one asked the mean&shy;ing of the great sac&shy;ri&shy;fice.  The Mas&shy;ter said, &#x02BC;I do not know. He who knew its mean&shy;ing would find it as eas&shy;y to gov&shy;ern the king&shy;dom as to look on this;-- point&shy;ing to his palm.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>3:12</sup>&#8239;He sacrificed to the dead, as if they were pres&shy;ent. He sacrificed to the spir&shy;its, as if the spir&shy;its were pres&shy;ent.  The Mas&shy;ter said, &#x02BC;I con&shy;sid&shy;er my not be&shy;ing pres&shy;ent at the sac&shy;ri&shy;fice, as if I did not sac&shy;ri&shy;fice.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>3:13</sup>&#8239;Wang-sun Chia asked, say&shy;ing, &#x02BC;What is the mean&shy;ing of the say&shy;ing, "It is bet&shy;ter to pay court to the fur&shy;nace than to the south-west cor&shy;ner?"&#x02BC; The Mas&shy;ter said, &#x02BC;Not so. He who of&shy;fends a&shy;gainst Heav&shy;en has none to whom he can pray.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>3:14</sup>&#8239;The Mas&shy;ter said, &#x02BC;Chau had the ad&shy;van&shy;tage of view&shy;ing the two past dynasties. How com&shy;plete and el&shy;e&shy;gant are its reg&shy;u&shy;la&shy;tions! I fol&shy;low Chau.&#x02BC;

<p>
    <sup>3:15</sup>&#8239;The Mas&shy;ter, when he en&shy;tered the grand tem&shy;ple, asked a&shy;bout eve&shy;ry&shy;thing. Some one said, &#x02BC;Who will say that the son of the man of Tsau knows the rules of pro&shy;pri&shy;e&shy;ty! He has en&shy;tered the grand tem&shy;ple and asks a&shy;bout eve&shy;ry&shy;thing.&#x02BC; The Mas&shy;ter heard the re&shy;mark, and said, &#x02BC;This is a rule of pro&shy;pri&shy;e&shy;ty.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>3:16</sup>&#8239;The Mas&shy;ter said, &#x02BC;In ar&shy;cher&shy;y it is not go&shy;ing through the leath&shy;er which is the prin&shy;ci&shy;pal thing;-- be&shy;cause peo&shy;ple&#x02BC;s strength is not e&shy;qual. This was the old way.&#x02BC;

    <sup>3:17</sup>&#8239;Tsze-kung wished to do a&shy;way with the of&shy;fer&shy;ing of a sheep con&shy;nect&shy;ed with the in&shy;au&shy;gu&shy;ra&shy;tion of the first day of each month. The Mas&shy;ter said, &#x02BC;Ts&#x02BC;ze, you love the sheep; I love the cer&shy;e&shy;mo&shy;ny.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>3:18</sup>&#8239;The Mas&shy;ter said, &#x02BC;The full ob&shy;serv&shy;ance of the rules of pro&shy;pri&shy;e&shy;ty in serv&shy;ing one&#x02BC;s prince is ac&shy;counted by peo&shy;ple to be flat&shy;ter&shy;y.&#x02BC;

<p>
    <sup>3:19</sup>&#8239;The Duke Ting asked how a prince should em&shy;ploy his min&shy;is&shy;ters, and how min&shy;is&shy;ters should serve their prince.  Confucius replied, &#x02BC;A prince should em&shy;ploy his min&shy;is&shy;ter ac&shy;cord&shy;ing to ac&shy;cord&shy;ing to the rules of pro&shy;pri&shy;e&shy;ty; min&shy;is&shy;ters should serve their prince with faith&shy;ful&shy;ness.&#x02BC;

<p>
    <sup>3:20</sup>&#8239;The Mas&shy;ter said, &#x02BC;The Kwan Tsu is ex&shy;pres&shy;sive of en&shy;joy&shy;ment with&shy;out be&shy;ing li&shy;cen&shy;tious, and of grief with&shy;out be&shy;ing hurt&shy;ful&shy;ly ex&shy;ces&shy;sive.&#x02BC;

<p>
    <sup>3:21</sup>&#8239;The Duke A&shy;i asked Tsai Wo a&shy;bout the al&shy;tars of the spir&shy;its of the land. Tsai Wo replied, &#x02BC;The Hsia sov&shy;er&shy;eign planted the pine tree a&shy;bout them; the men of the Yin planted the cy&shy;press;  and the men of the Chau planted the chest&shy;nut tree, mean&shy;ing there&shy;by to cause the peo&shy;ple to be in awe.&#x02BC; When the Mas&shy;ter heard it, he said, &#x02BC;Things that are done, it is need&shy;less to speak a&shy;bout; things that have had their course, it is need&shy;less to re&shy;mon&shy;strate a&shy;bout; things that are past, it is need&shy;less to blame.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>3:22</sup>&#8239;The Mas&shy;ter said, &#x02BC;Small in&shy;deed was the ca&shy;pac&shy;i&shy;ty of Kwan Chung!&#x02BC; Some one said, &#x02BC;Was Kwan Chung par&shy;si&shy;mo&shy;ni&shy;ous?&#x02BC; &#x02BC;Kwan,&#x02BC; was the re&shy;ply, &#x02BC;had the San Kwei, and his of&shy;fic&shy;ers per&shy;formed no dou&shy;ble duties; how can he be con&shy;sid&shy;ered par&shy;si&shy;mo&shy;ni&shy;ous?&#x02BC; &#x02BC;Then, did Kwan Chung know the rules of pro&shy;pri&shy;e&shy;ty?&#x02BC; The Mas&shy;ter said, &#x02BC;The prin&shy;ces of States have a screen intercepting the view at their gates. Kwan had like&shy;wise a screen at his gate. The prin&shy;ces of States on any friend&shy;ly meet&shy;ing be&shy;tween two of them, had a stand on which to place their in&shy;verted cups. Kwan had al&shy;so such a stand. If Kwan knew the rules of pro&shy;pri&shy;e&shy;ty, who does not know them?&#x02BC;

<p>
    <sup>3:23</sup>&#8239;The Mas&shy;ter instructing the grand mu&shy;sic-master of Lu said, &#x02BC;How to play mu&shy;sic may be known.

The king&shy;dom has long been with&shy;out the prin&shy;ci&shy;ples of truth and right; Heav&shy;en is go&shy;ing to use your mas&shy;ter as a bell with its wood&shy;en tongue.&#x02BC;

    <sup>4:1</sup>&#8239;The Mas&shy;ter said, &#x02BC;It is vir&shy;tu&shy;ous man&shy;ners which con&shy;sti&shy;tute the ex&shy;cel&shy;lence of a neigh&shy;bor&shy;hood. If a man in selecting a res&shy;i&shy;dence, do not fix on one where such pre&shy;vail, how can he be wise?&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>4:2</sup>&#8239;The Mas&shy;ter said, &#x02BC;Those who are with&shy;out vir&shy;tue can&shy;not a&shy;bide long ei&shy;ther in a con&shy;di&shy;tion of pov&shy;er&shy;ty and hard&shy;ship, or in a con&shy;di&shy;tion of en&shy;joy&shy;ment.

</p>

<p>
    <sup>4:5</sup>&#8239;The Mas&shy;ter said, &#x02BC;Riches and honours are what men de&shy;sire. If it can&shy;not be ob&shy;tained in the prop&shy;er way, they should not be held. Pov&shy;er&shy;ty and meanness are what men dis&shy;like. If it can&shy;not be a&shy;voided in the prop&shy;er way, they should not be a&shy;voided.  &#x02BC;If a su&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;or man a&shy;ban&shy;don vir&shy;tue, how can he ful&shy;fil the re&shy;quire&shy;ments of that name?  &#x02BC;The su&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;or man does not, e&shy;ven for the space of a sin&shy;gle meal, act con&shy;tra&shy;ry to vir&shy;tue. In mo&shy;ments of haste, he cleaves to it.  In sea&shy;sons of dan&shy;ger, he cleaves to it.&#x02BC;

    <sup>4:6</sup>&#8239;The Mas&shy;ter said, &#x02BC;I have not seen a per&shy;son who loved vir&shy;tue, or one who hat&shy;ed what was not vir&shy;tu&shy;ous. He who loved vir&shy;tue, would es&shy;teem noth&shy;ing a&shy;bove it.

    <sup>4:7</sup>&#8239;The Mas&shy;ter said, &#x02BC;The faults of men are char&shy;ac&shy;ter&shy;is&shy;tic of the class to which they be&shy;long. By ob&shy;serv&shy;ing a man&#x02BC;s faults, it may be known that he is vir&shy;tu&shy;ous.&#x02BC;

    <sup>6:15</sup>&#8239;The Mas&shy;ter said, &#x02BC;Who can go out but by the door?  How is it that men will not walk ac&shy;cord&shy;ing to these ways?&#x02BC;

<p>
    <sup>6:16</sup>&#8239;The Mas&shy;ter said, &#x02BC;Where the sol&shy;id qualities are in ex&shy;cess of ac&shy;com&shy;plish&shy;ments, we have rusticity; where the ac&shy;com&shy;plish&shy;ments are in ex&shy;cess of the sol&shy;id qualities, we have the man&shy;ners of a clerk. When the ac&shy;com&shy;plish&shy;ments and sol&shy;id qualities are e&shy;qual&shy;ly blend&shy;ed, we then have the man of vir&shy;tue.&#x02BC;

<p>
    <sup>6:17</sup>&#8239;The Mas&shy;ter said, &#x02BC;Man is born for uprightness. If a man lose his uprightness, and yet live, his es&shy;cape from death is the ef&shy;fect of mer&shy;e good for&shy;tune.&#x02BC;
</p>

    <sup>6:18</sup>&#8239;The Mas&shy;ter said, &#x02BC;They who know the truth are not e&shy;qual to those who love it, and they who love it are not e&shy;qual to those who de&shy;light in it.&#x02BC;

To those who are be&shy;low me&shy;di&shy;oc&shy;ri&shy;ty, the highest sub&shy;jects may not be an&shy;nounced.&#x02BC;

    <sup>6:20</sup>&#8239;Fan Ch&#x02BC;ih asked what con&shy;sti&shy;tut&shy;ed wis&shy;dom.

Must he not have the qualities of a sage? E&shy;ven Yao and Shun were still so&shy;lic&shy;i&shy;tous a&shy;bout this.  &#x02BC;Now the man of per&shy;fect vir&shy;tue, wishing to be es&shy;tab&shy;lished him&shy;self, seeks al&shy;so to es&shy;tab&shy;lish oth&shy;ers; wishing to be en&shy;larged him&shy;self, he seeks al&shy;so to en&shy;large oth&shy;ers. &#x02BC;To be a&shy;ble to judge of oth&shy;ers by what is nigh in our&shy;selves;-- this may be called the art of vir&shy;tue.&#x02BC;

    <sup>7:5</sup>&#8239;The Mas&shy;ter said, &#x02BC;Extreme is my de&shy;cay. For a long time, I have not dreamed, as I was wont to do, that I saw the duke of Chau.&#x02BC;

    <sup>7:7</sup>&#8239;The Mas&shy;ter said, &#x02BC;From the man bring&shy;ing his bun&shy;dle of dried flesh for my teach&shy;ing up&shy;wards, I have nev&shy;er re&shy;fused in&shy;struc&shy;tion to any one.&#x02BC;

    <sup>7:8</sup>&#8239;The Mas&shy;ter said, &#x02BC;I do not o&shy;pen up the truth to one who is not ea&shy;ger to get knowl&shy;edge, nor help out any one who is not anx&shy;ious to ex&shy;plain him&shy;self. When I have pre&shy;sented one cor&shy;ner of a sub&shy;ject to any one, and he can&shy;not from it learn the oth&shy;er three, I do not re&shy;peat my les&shy;son.&#x02BC;

    <sup>7:10</sup>&#8239;The Mas&shy;ter said to Yen Yu&shy;an, &#x02BC;When called to of&shy;fice, to un&shy;der&shy;take its duties; when not so called, to lie re&shy;tired;-- it is on&shy;ly I and you who have at&shy;tained to this.&#x02BC; Tsze-lu said, &#x02BC;If you had the con&shy;duct of the armies of a great State, whom would you have to act with you?&#x02BC; The Mas&shy;ter said, &#x02BC;I would not have him to act with me, who will un&shy;armed at&shy;tack a ti&shy;ger, or cross a riv&shy;er with&shy;out a boat, dy&shy;ing with&shy;out any re&shy;gret. My as&shy;so&shy;ci&shy;ate must be the man who pro&shy;ceeds to ac&shy;tion full of so&shy;lic&shy;i&shy;tude, who is fond of adjusting his plans, and then carries them in&shy;to ex&shy;e&shy;cu&shy;tion.&#x02BC;

<p>
    <sup>7:12</sup>&#8239;The things in ref&shy;er&shy;ence to which the Mas&shy;ter ex&shy;er&shy;cised the great&shy;est cau&shy;tion were -- fasting, war, and sick&shy;ness.

    <sup>7:16</sup>&#8239;The Mas&shy;ter said, &#x02BC;If some years were added to my life, I would give fif&shy;ty to the stud&shy;y of the Yi, and then I might come to be with&shy;out great faults.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>7:17</sup>&#8239;The Mas&shy;ter&#x02BC;s fre&shy;quent themes of dis&shy;course were-- the Odes, the His&shy;to&shy;ry, and the main&shy;te&shy;nance of the Rules of Pro&shy;pri&shy;e&shy;ty. On all these he fre&shy;quent&shy;ly dis&shy;coursed.

<p>
    <sup>7:18</sup>&#8239;The Duke of Sheh asked Tsze-lu a&shy;bout Confucius, and Tsze-lu did not an&shy;swer him.

<p>
    <sup>7:19</sup>&#8239;The Mas&shy;ter said, &#x02BC;I am not one who was born in the pos&shy;ses&shy;sion of knowl&shy;edge; I am one who is fond of an&shy;tiq&shy;ui&shy;ty, and ear&shy;nest in seek&shy;ing it there.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>7:20</sup>&#8239;The sub&shy;jects on which the Mas&shy;ter did not talk, were-- ex&shy;traor&shy;di&shy;nar&shy;y things, feats of strength, dis&shy;or&shy;der, and spir&shy;it&shy;u&shy;al be&shy;ings.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>7:21</sup>&#8239;The Mas&shy;ter said, &#x02BC;When I walk a&shy;long with two oth&shy;ers, they may serve me as my teach&shy;ers. I will se&shy;lect their good qualities and fol&shy;low them, their bad qualities and a&shy;void them.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>7:22</sup>&#8239;The Mas&shy;ter said, &#x02BC;Heaven pro&shy;duced the vir&shy;tue that is in me. Hwan T&#x02BC;ui-- what can he do to me?&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>7:23</sup>&#8239;The Mas&shy;ter said, &#x02BC;Do you think, my dis&shy;ci&shy;ples, that I have any con&shy;ceal&shy;ments? I con&shy;ceal noth&shy;ing from you. There is noth&shy;ing which I do that is not shown to you, my dis&shy;ci&shy;ples;-- that is my way.&#x02BC;

<p>
    <sup>7:24</sup>&#8239;There were four things which the Mas&shy;ter taught,-- let&shy;ters, eth&shy;ics, de&shy;vo&shy;tion of soul, and truthfulness.

    <sup>7:25</sup>&#8239;The Mas&shy;ter said, &#x02BC;A sage it is not mine to see;  could I see a man of re&shy;al tal&shy;ent and vir&shy;tue, that would sat&shy;is&shy;fy me.&#x02BC; The Mas&shy;ter said, &#x02BC;A good man it is not mine to see; could I see a man pos&shy;sessed of con&shy;stan&shy;cy, that would sat&shy;is&shy;fy me.  &#x02BC;Having not and yet af&shy;fect&shy;ing to have, emp&shy;ty and yet af&shy;fect&shy;ing to be full, strait&shy;ened and yet af&shy;fect&shy;ing to be at ease:-- it is dif&shy;fi&shy;cult with such char&shy;ac&shy;ter&shy;is&shy;tics to have con&shy;stan&shy;cy.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>7:26</sup>&#8239;The Mas&shy;ter an&shy;gled,-- but did not use a net. He shot,-- but not at birds perching.

<p>
    <sup>7:27</sup>&#8239;The Mas&shy;ter said, &#x02BC;There may be those who act with&shy;out know&shy;ing why. I do not do so. Hear&shy;ing much and selecting what is good and fol&shy;low&shy;ing it; see&shy;ing much and keep&shy;ing it in mem&shy;o&shy;ry:-- this is the sec&shy;ond style of knowl&shy;edge.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>7:28</sup>&#8239;It was dif&shy;fi&shy;cult to talk (profitably and rep&shy;u&shy;ta&shy;bly) with the peo&shy;ple of Hu-hsiang, and a lad of that place hav&shy;ing had an in&shy;ter&shy;view with the Mas&shy;ter, the dis&shy;ci&shy;ples doubted.  The Mas&shy;ter said, &#x02BC;I ad&shy;mit peo&shy;ple&#x02BC;s ap&shy;proach to me with&shy;out com&shy;mit&shy;ting my&shy;self as to what they may do when they have re&shy;tired.  Why must one be so se&shy;vere? If a man pu&shy;ri&shy;fy him&shy;self to wait up&shy;on me, I re&shy;ceive him so pu&shy;ri&shy;fied, with&shy;out guar&shy;an&shy;tee&shy;ing his past con&shy;duct.&#x02BC;

<p>
    <sup>7:29</sup>&#8239;The Mas&shy;ter said, &#x02BC;Is vir&shy;tue a thing re&shy;mote? I wish to be vir&shy;tu&shy;ous, and lo! vir&shy;tue is at hand.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>7:30</sup>&#8239;The min&shy;is&shy;ter of crime of Ch&#x02BC;an asked wheth&shy;er the duke Chao knew pro&shy;pri&shy;e&shy;ty, and Confucius said, &#x02BC;He knew pro&shy;pri&shy;e&shy;ty.&#x02BC; Confucius hav&shy;ing re&shy;tired, the min&shy;is&shy;ter bowed to Wu-ma Ch&#x02BC;i to come for&shy;ward, and said, &#x02BC;I have heard that the su&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;or man is not a par&shy;ti&shy;san. May the su&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;or man be a par&shy;ti&shy;san al&shy;so? The prince mar&shy;ried a daugh&shy;ter of the house of Wu, of the same sur&shy;name with him&shy;self, and called her,-- "The eld&shy;er Tsze of Wu." If the prince knew pro&shy;pri&shy;e&shy;ty, who does not know it?&#x02BC; Wu-ma Ch&#x02BC;i re&shy;ported these re&shy;marks, and the Mas&shy;ter said, &#x02BC;I am for&shy;tu&shy;nate! If I have any er&shy;rors, peo&shy;ple are sure to know them.&#x02BC;

<p>
    <sup>7:31</sup>&#8239;When the Mas&shy;ter was in com&shy;pa&shy;ny with a per&shy;son who was sing&shy;ing, if he sang well, he would make him re&shy;peat the song, while he ac&shy;com&shy;pa&shy;nied it with his own voice.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>7:32</sup>&#8239;The Mas&shy;ter said, &#x02BC;In let&shy;ters I am per&shy;haps e&shy;qual to oth&shy;er men, but the char&shy;ac&shy;ter of the su&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;or man, car&shy;ry&shy;ing out in his con&shy;duct what he professes, is what I have not yet at&shy;tained to.&#x02BC;

    <sup>7:33</sup>&#8239;The Mas&shy;ter said, &#x02BC;The sage and the man of per&shy;fect vir&shy;tue;-- how dare I rank my&shy;self with them? It may simp&shy;ly be said of me, that I strive to be&shy;come such with&shy;out sa&shy;ti&shy;e&shy;ty, and teach oth&shy;ers with&shy;out wea&shy;ri&shy;ness.&#x02BC; Kung-hsi Hwa said, &#x02BC;This is just what we, the dis&shy;ci&shy;ples, can&shy;not im&shy;i&shy;tate you in.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>7:34</sup>&#8239;The Mas&shy;ter be&shy;ing ver&shy;y sick, Tsze-lu asked leave to pray for him. He said, &#x02BC;May such a thing be done?&#x02BC; Tsze-lu replied, &#x02BC;It may. In the Eulogies it is said, "Prayer has been made for thee to the spir&shy;its of the up&shy;per and low&shy;er worlds."&#x02BC; The Mas&shy;ter said, &#x02BC;My praying has been for a long time.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>7:35</sup>&#8239;The Mas&shy;ter said, &#x02BC;Extravagance leads to in&shy;sub&shy;or&shy;di&shy;na&shy;tion, and par&shy;si&shy;mo&shy;ny to meanness. It is bet&shy;ter to be mean than to be in&shy;sub&shy;or&shy;di&shy;nate.&#x02BC;

    <sup>7:36</sup>&#8239;The Mas&shy;ter said, &#x02BC;The su&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;or man is sat&shy;is&shy;fied and com&shy;posed; the mean man is al&shy;ways full of dis&shy;tress.&#x02BC;

It is said in the Book of Po&shy;et&shy;ry, "We should be ap&shy;pre&shy;hen&shy;sive and cau&shy;tious, as if on the brink of a deep gulf, as if tread&shy;ing on thin ice," and so have I been. Now and here&shy;af&shy;ter, I know my es&shy;cape from all in&shy;ju&shy;ry to my per&shy;son, O ye, my lit&shy;tle chil&shy;dren.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>8:4</sup>&#8239;1. The phi&shy;los&shy;o&shy;pher Tsang be&shy;ing ill, Meng Chang went to ask how he was.  Tsang said to him, &#x02BC;When a bird is a&shy;bout to die, its notes are mourn&shy;ful; when a man is a&shy;bout to die, his words are good. &#x02BC;There are three prin&shy;ci&shy;ples of con&shy;duct which the man of high rank should con&shy;sid&shy;er spe&shy;cial&shy;ly im&shy;por&shy;tant:-- that in his de&shy;port&shy;ment and man&shy;ner he keep from vi&shy;o&shy;lence and heed&shy;less&shy;ness;  that in reg&shy;u&shy;lat&shy;ing his coun&shy;te&shy;nance he keep near to sin&shy;cer&shy;i&shy;ty; and that in his words and tones he keep far from low&shy;ness and im&shy;pro&shy;pri&shy;e&shy;ty. As to such mat&shy;ters as at&shy;tend&shy;ing to the sac&shy;ri&shy;fi&shy;cial ves&shy;sels, there are the prop&shy;er of&shy;fic&shy;ers for them.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>8:5</sup>&#8239;The phi&shy;los&shy;o&shy;pher Tsang said, &#x02BC;Gifted with a&shy;bil&shy;i&shy;ty, and yet put&shy;ting ques&shy;tions to those who were not so; pos&shy;sessed of much, and yet put&shy;ting ques&shy;tions to those pos&shy;sessed of lit&shy;tle; hav&shy;ing, as though he had not; full, and yet counting him&shy;self as emp&shy;ty;  of&shy;fended a&shy;gainst, and yet entering in&shy;to no al&shy;ter&shy;ca&shy;tion; for&shy;mer&shy;ly I had a friend who pur&shy;sued this style of con&shy;duct.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>8:6</sup>&#8239;The phi&shy;los&shy;o&shy;pher Tsang said, &#x02BC;Suppose that there is an in&shy;di&shy;vid&shy;u&shy;al who can be en&shy;trusted with the charge of a young or&shy;phan prince, and can be com&shy;mis&shy;sioned with au&shy;thor&shy;i&shy;ty o&shy;ver a state of a hun&shy;dred li, and whom no e&shy;mer&shy;gen&shy;cy how&shy;ev&shy;er great can drive from his prin&shy;ci&shy;ples:-- is such a man a su&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;or man? He is a su&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;or man in&shy;deed.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>8:7</sup>&#8239;1. The phi&shy;los&shy;o&shy;pher Tsang said, &#x02BC;The of&shy;fic&shy;er may not be with&shy;out breadth of mind and vig&shy;or&shy;ous en&shy;dur&shy;ance. His bur&shy;den is heav&shy;y and his course is long.  &#x02BC;Perfect vir&shy;tue is the bur&shy;den which he con&shy;sid&shy;ers it is his to sus&shy;tain;-- is it not heav&shy;y? On&shy;ly with death does his course stop;-- is it not long?
</p>

<p>
    <sup>8:8</sup>&#8239;The Mas&shy;ter said, &#x02BC;It is by the Odes that the mind is a&shy;roused.  &#x02BC;It is by the Rules of Pro&shy;pri&shy;e&shy;ty that the char&shy;ac&shy;ter is es&shy;tab&shy;lished. &#x02BC;It is from Mu&shy;sic that the fin&shy;ish is re&shy;ceived.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>8:9</sup>&#8239;The Mas&shy;ter said, &#x02BC;The peo&shy;ple may be made to fol&shy;low a path of ac&shy;tion, but they may not be made to un&shy;der&shy;stand it.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>8:10</sup>&#8239;The Mas&shy;ter said, &#x02BC;The man who is fond of dar&shy;ing and is dis&shy;sat&shy;is&shy;fied with pov&shy;er&shy;ty, will pro&shy;ceed to in&shy;sub&shy;or&shy;di&shy;na&shy;tion. So will the man who is not vir&shy;tu&shy;ous, when you car&shy;ry your dis&shy;like of him to an ex&shy;treme.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>8:11</sup>&#8239;The Mas&shy;ter said, &#x02BC;Though a man have abilities as ad&shy;mi&shy;ra&shy;ble as those of the Duke of Chau, yet if he be proud and nig&shy;gard&shy;ly, those oth&shy;er things are re&shy;al&shy;ly not worth be&shy;ing looked at.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>8:12</sup>&#8239;The Mas&shy;ter said, &#x02BC;It is not eas&shy;y to find a man who has learn&shy;ed for three years with&shy;out com&shy;ing to be good.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>8:13</sup>&#8239;The Mas&shy;ter said, &#x02BC;With sin&shy;cere faith he u&shy;nites the love of learn&shy;ing; hold&shy;ing firm to death, he is perfecting the ex&shy;cel&shy;lence of his course.  &#x02BC;Such an one will not en&shy;ter a tot&shy;ter&shy;ing State, nor dwell in a dis&shy;or&shy;gan&shy;ized one. When right prin&shy;ci&shy;ples of gov&shy;ern&shy;ment pre&shy;vail in the king&shy;dom, he will show him&shy;self; when they are prostrated, he will keep con&shy;cealed.  &#x02BC;When a coun&shy;try is well-governed, pov&shy;er&shy;ty and a mean con&shy;di&shy;tion are things to be a&shy;shamed of. When a coun&shy;try is ill- gov&shy;erned, rich&shy;es and honour are things to be a&shy;shamed of.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>8:14</sup>&#8239;The Mas&shy;ter said, &#x02BC;He who is not in any par&shy;tic&shy;u&shy;lar of&shy;fice, has noth&shy;ing to do with plans for the ad&shy;min&shy;is&shy;tra&shy;tion of its duties.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>8:15</sup>&#8239;The Mas&shy;ter said, &#x02BC;When the mu&shy;sic mas&shy;ter Chih first en&shy;tered on his of&shy;fice, the fin&shy;ish of the Kwan Tsu was mag&shy;nif&shy;i&shy;cent;-- how it filled the ears!&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>8:16</sup>&#8239;The Mas&shy;ter said, &#x02BC;Ardent and yet not up&shy;right; stu&shy;pid and yet not at&shy;ten&shy;tive; sim&shy;ple and yet not sin&shy;cere:-- such per&shy;sons I do not un&shy;der&shy;stand.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>8:17</sup>&#8239;The Mas&shy;ter said, &#x02BC;Learn as if you could not reach your ob&shy;ject, and were al&shy;ways fearing al&shy;so lest you should lose it.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>8:18</sup>&#8239;The Mas&shy;ter said, &#x02BC;How ma&shy;jes&shy;tic was the man&shy;ner in which Shun and Yu held pos&shy;ses&shy;sion of the em&shy;pire, as if it were noth&shy;ing to them!&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>8:19</sup>&#8239;The Mas&shy;ter said, &#x02BC;Great in&shy;deed was Yao as a sov&shy;er&shy;eign! How ma&shy;jes&shy;tic was he! It is on&shy;ly Heav&shy;en that is grand, and on&shy;ly Yao cor&shy;re&shy;sponded to it. How vast was his vir&shy;tue! The peo&shy;ple could find no name for it.  &#x02BC;How ma&shy;jes&shy;tic was he in the works which he ac&shy;com&shy;plished!  How glo&shy;ri&shy;ous in the el&shy;e&shy;gant reg&shy;u&shy;la&shy;tions which he in&shy;sti&shy;tut&shy;ed!&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>8:20</sup>&#8239;Shun had five min&shy;is&shy;ters, and the em&shy;pire was well-governed.  King Wu said, &#x02BC;I have ten a&shy;ble min&shy;is&shy;ters.&#x02BC; Confucius said, &#x02BC;Is not the say&shy;ing that tal&shy;ents are dif&shy;fi&shy;cult to find, true? On&shy;ly when the dynasties of T&#x02BC;ang and Yu met, were they more a&shy;bun&shy;dant than in this of Chau, yet there was a wom&shy;an a&shy;mong them. The a&shy;ble min&shy;is&shy;ters were no more than nine men.  &#x02BC;King Wan pos&shy;sessed two of the three parts of the em&shy;pire, and with those he served the dyn&shy;as&shy;ty of Yin. The vir&shy;tue of the house of Chau may be said to have reached the highest point in&shy;deed.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>8:21</sup>&#8239;The Mas&shy;ter said, &#x02BC;I can find no flaw in the char&shy;ac&shy;ter of Yu. He used him&shy;self coarse food and drink, but dis&shy;played the ut&shy;most fil&shy;ial pi&shy;e&shy;ty to&shy;wards the spir&shy;its. His or&shy;di&shy;nar&shy;y gar&shy;ments were poor, but he dis&shy;played the ut&shy;most el&shy;e&shy;gance in his sac&shy;ri&shy;fi&shy;cial cap and a&shy;pron. He lived in a low mean house, but ex&shy;pended all his strength on the ditches and wa&shy;ter-channels. I can find noth&shy;ing like a flaw in Yu.&#x02BC;

<p>
    <sup>9:1</sup>&#8239;The sub&shy;jects of which the Mas&shy;ter sel&shy;dom spoke were-- prof&shy;it&shy;a&shy;ble&shy;ness, and al&shy;so the ap&shy;point&shy;ments of Heav&shy;en, and per&shy;fect vir&shy;tue.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>9:2</sup>&#8239;A man of the vil&shy;lage of Ta-hsiang said, &#x02BC;Great in&shy;deed is the phi&shy;los&shy;o&shy;pher K&#x02BC;ung! His learn&shy;ing is ex&shy;ten&shy;sive, and yet he does not rend&shy;er his name fa&shy;mous by any par&shy;tic&shy;u&shy;lar thing.&#x02BC; The Mas&shy;ter heard the ob&shy;ser&shy;va&shy;tion, and said to his dis&shy;ci&shy;ples, &#x02BC;What shall I prac&shy;tise? Shall I prac&shy;tise charioteering, or shall I prac&shy;tise ar&shy;cher&shy;y? I will prac&shy;tise charioteering.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>9:3</sup>&#8239;The Mas&shy;ter said, &#x02BC;The lin&shy;en cap is that pre&shy;scribed by the rules of cer&shy;e&shy;mo&shy;ny, but now a silk one is worn. It is e&shy;co&shy;nom&shy;i&shy;cal, and I fol&shy;low the com&shy;mon prac&shy;tice.  &#x02BC;The rules of cer&shy;e&shy;mo&shy;ny pre&shy;scribe the bow&shy;ing be&shy;low the hall, but now the prac&shy;tice is to bow on&shy;ly af&shy;ter as&shy;cend&shy;ing it. That is ar&shy;ro&shy;gant. I con&shy;tin&shy;ue to bow be&shy;low the hall, though I op&shy;pose the com&shy;mon prac&shy;tice.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>9:4</sup>&#8239;There were four things from which the Mas&shy;ter was en&shy;tire&shy;ly free. He had no fore&shy;gone con&shy;clu&shy;sions, no ar&shy;bi&shy;trar&shy;y pre&shy;de&shy;ter&shy;mi&shy;na&shy;tions, no ob&shy;sti&shy;na&shy;cy, and no e&shy;go&shy;ism.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>9:5</sup>&#8239;The Mas&shy;ter was put in fear in K&#x02BC;wang.  He said, &#x02BC;After the death of King Wan, was not the cause of truth lodged here in me?  &#x02BC;If Heav&shy;en had wished to let this cause of truth per&shy;ish, then I, a fu&shy;ture mor&shy;tal, should not have got such a re&shy;la&shy;tion to that cause. While Heav&shy;en does not let the cause of truth per&shy;ish, what can the peo&shy;ple of K&#x02BC;wang do to me?&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>9:6</sup>&#8239;A high of&shy;fic&shy;er asked Tsze-kung, say&shy;ing, &#x02BC;May we not say that your Mas&shy;ter is a sage? How var&shy;i&shy;ous is his a&shy;bil&shy;i&shy;ty!&#x02BC; Tsze-kung said, &#x02BC;Certainly Heav&shy;en has en&shy;dowed him un&shy;lim&shy;it&shy;ed&shy;ly. He is a&shy;bout a sage. And, more&shy;o&shy;ver, his a&shy;bil&shy;i&shy;ty is var&shy;i&shy;ous.&#x02BC; The Mas&shy;ter heard of the con&shy;ver&shy;sa&shy;tion and said, &#x02BC;Does the high of&shy;fic&shy;er know me? When I was young, my con&shy;di&shy;tion was low, and there&shy;fore I ac&shy;quired my a&shy;bil&shy;i&shy;ty in man&shy;y things, but they were mean mat&shy;ters. Must the su&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;or man have such va&shy;ri&shy;e&shy;ty of a&shy;bil&shy;i&shy;ty?  He does not need va&shy;ri&shy;e&shy;ty of a&shy;bil&shy;i&shy;ty.&#x02BC; Lao said, &#x02BC;The Mas&shy;ter said, "Having no of&shy;fi&shy;cial em&shy;ploy&shy;ment, I ac&shy;quired man&shy;y arts."&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>9:7</sup>&#8239;The Mas&shy;ter said, &#x02BC;Am I in&shy;deed pos&shy;sessed of knowl&shy;edge? I am not know&shy;ing. But if a mean per&shy;son, who ap&shy;pears quite emp&shy;ty-like, ask any&shy;thing of me, I set it forth from one end to the oth&shy;er, and ex&shy;haust it.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>9:8</sup>&#8239;The Mas&shy;ter said, &#x02BC;The FANG bird does not come; the riv&shy;er sends forth no map:-- it is all o&shy;ver with me!&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>9:9</sup>&#8239;When the Mas&shy;ter saw a per&shy;son in a mourn&shy;ing dress, or any one with the cap and up&shy;per and low&shy;er gar&shy;ments of full dress, or a blind per&shy;son, on ob&shy;serv&shy;ing them approaching, though they were young&shy;er than him&shy;self, he would rise up, and if he had to pass by them, he would do so hast&shy;i&shy;ly.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>9:10</sup>&#8239;Yen Yu&shy;an, in ad&shy;mi&shy;ra&shy;tion of the Mas&shy;ter&#x02BC;s doc&shy;trines, sighed and said, &#x02BC;I looked up to them, and they seemed to be&shy;come more high; I tried to pen&shy;e&shy;trate them, and they seemed to be&shy;come more firm; I looked at them be&shy;fore me, and sud&shy;den&shy;ly they seemed to be be&shy;hind. &#x02BC;The Mas&shy;ter, by or&shy;der&shy;ly meth&shy;od, skil&shy;ful&shy;ly leads men on. He en&shy;larged my mind with learn&shy;ing, and taught me the re&shy;straints of pro&shy;pri&shy;e&shy;ty.  &#x02BC;When I wish to give o&shy;ver the stud&shy;y of his doc&shy;trines, I can&shy;not do so, and hav&shy;ing ex&shy;erted all my a&shy;bil&shy;i&shy;ty, there seems some&shy;thing to stand right up be&shy;fore me; but though I wish to fol&shy;low and lay hold of it, I re&shy;al&shy;ly find no way to do so.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>9:11</sup>&#8239;The Mas&shy;ter be&shy;ing ver&shy;y ill, Tsze-lu wished the dis&shy;ci&shy;ples to act as min&shy;is&shy;ters to him.  Dur&shy;ing a re&shy;mis&shy;sion of his ill&shy;ness, he said, &#x02BC;Long has the con&shy;duct of Yu been de&shy;ceit&shy;ful! By pretending to have min&shy;is&shy;ters when I have them not, whom should I im&shy;pose up&shy;on? Should I im&shy;pose up&shy;on Heav&shy;en?  &#x02BC;Moreover, than that I should die in the hands of min&shy;is&shy;ters, is it not bet&shy;ter that I should die in the hands of you, my dis&shy;ci&shy;ples?  And though I may not get a great bur&shy;i&shy;al, shall I die up&shy;on the road?&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>9:12</sup>&#8239;Tsze-kung said, &#x02BC;There is a beau&shy;ti&shy;ful gem here.  Should I lay it up in a case and keep it? or should I seek for a good price and sell it?&#x02BC; The Mas&shy;ter said, &#x02BC;Sell it! Sell it! But I would wait for one to of&shy;fer the price.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>9:13</sup>&#8239;The Mas&shy;ter was wishing to go and live a&shy;mong the nine wild tribes of the east.  Some one said, &#x02BC;They are rude. How can you do such a thing?&#x02BC; The Mas&shy;ter said, &#x02BC;If a su&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;or man dwelt a&shy;mong them, what rude&shy;ness would there be?&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>9:14</sup>&#8239;The Mas&shy;ter said, &#x02BC;I re&shy;turned from Wei to Lu, and then the mu&shy;sic was re&shy;formed, and the pieces in the Roy&shy;al songs and Praise songs all found their prop&shy;er places.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>9:15</sup>&#8239;The Mas&shy;ter said, &#x02BC;Abroad, to serve the high min&shy;is&shy;ters and no&shy;bles; at home, to serve one&#x02BC;s fa&shy;ther and eld&shy;er broth&shy;ers; in all duties to the dead, not to dare not to ex&shy;ert one&#x02BC;s self;  and not to be o&shy;ver&shy;come of wine:-- which one of these things do I at&shy;tain to?&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>9:16</sup>&#8239;The Mas&shy;ter stand&shy;ing by a stream, said, &#x02BC;It passes on just like this, not ceas&shy;ing day or night!&#x02BC;

<p>
    <sup>9:17</sup>&#8239;The Mas&shy;ter said, &#x02BC;I have not seen one who loves vir&shy;tue as he loves beau&shy;ty.&#x02BC;

    <sup>9:18</sup>&#8239;The Mas&shy;ter said, &#x02BC;The pros&shy;e&shy;cu&shy;tion of learn&shy;ing may be com&shy;pared to what may hap&shy;pen in rais&shy;ing a mound. If there want but one bas&shy;ket of earth to com&shy;plete the work, and I stop, the stop&shy;ping is my own work. It may be com&shy;pared to throwing down the earth on the lev&shy;el ground. Though but one bas&shy;ket&shy;ful is thrown at a time, the ad&shy;vanc&shy;ing with it is my own go&shy;ing for&shy;ward.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>9:21</sup>&#8239;The Mas&shy;ter said, &#x02BC;There are cases in which the blade springs, but the plant does not go on to flow&shy;er! There are cases where it flow&shy;ers, but no fruit is sub&shy;se&shy;quent&shy;ly pro&shy;duced!&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>9:22</sup>&#8239;The Mas&shy;ter said, &#x02BC;A youth is to be re&shy;garded with re&shy;spect. How do we know that his fu&shy;ture will not be e&shy;qual to our pres&shy;ent? If he reach the age of for&shy;ty or fif&shy;ty, and has not made him&shy;self heard of, then in&shy;deed he will not be worth be&shy;ing re&shy;garded with re&shy;spect.&#x02BC;

<p>
    <sup>9:25</sup>&#8239;The Mas&shy;ter said, &#x02BC;Can men ref&shy;use to as&shy;sent to the words of strict ad&shy;mo&shy;ni&shy;tion? But it is reforming the con&shy;duct be&shy;cause of them which is val&shy;u&shy;a&shy;ble. Can men ref&shy;use to be pleased with words of gen&shy;tle ad&shy;vice? But it is unfolding their aim which is val&shy;u&shy;a&shy;ble. If a man be pleased with these words, but does not un&shy;fold their aim, and as&shy;sents to those, but does not re&shy;form his con&shy;duct, I can re&shy;al&shy;ly do noth&shy;ing with him.&#x02BC;

<p>
    <sup>9:25</sup>&#8239;The Mas&shy;ter said, &#x02BC;The com&shy;mand&shy;er of the forces of a large state may be car&shy;ried off, but the will of e&shy;ven a com&shy;mon man can&shy;not be tak&shy;en from him.&#x02BC;

<p>
    <sup>9:26</sup>&#8239;The Mas&shy;ter said, &#x02BC;Dressed him&shy;self in a tat&shy;tered robe quilt&shy;ed with hemp, yet stand&shy;ing by the side of men dressed in furs, and not a&shy;shamed;-- ah! it is Yu who is e&shy;qual to this!  &#x02BC;"He dis&shy;likes none, he cov&shy;ets noth&shy;ing;-- what can he do but what is good!"&#x02BC; Tsze-lu kept con&shy;tin&shy;u&shy;al&shy;ly repeating these words of the ode, when the Mas&shy;ter said, &#x02BC;Those things are by no means suf&shy;fi&shy;cient to con&shy;sti&shy;tute (perfect) ex&shy;cel&shy;lence.&#x02BC;

    <sup>9:30</sup>&#8239;How the flow&shy;ers of the as&shy;pen-plum flut&shy;ter and turn! Do I not think of you? But your house is dis&shy;tant.  The Mas&shy;ter said, &#x02BC;It is the want of thought a&shy;bout it. How is it dis&shy;tant?&#x02BC;

<p>
    <sup>10:1</sup>&#8239;Confucius, in his vil&shy;lage, looked sim&shy;ple and sin&shy;cere, and as if he were not a&shy;ble to speak.  When he was in the prince&#x02BC;s ancestorial tem&shy;ple, or in the court, he spoke min&shy;ute&shy;ly on eve&shy;ry point, but cau&shy;tious&shy;ly.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>10:2</sup>&#8239;When he was waiting at court, in speak&shy;ing with the great of&shy;fic&shy;ers of the low&shy;er grade, he spake free&shy;ly, but in a straight&shy;for&shy;ward man&shy;ner; in speak&shy;ing with those of the higher grade, he did so bland&shy;ly, but pre&shy;cise&shy;ly.  When the rul&shy;er was pres&shy;ent, his man&shy;ner dis&shy;played re&shy;spect&shy;ful un&shy;eas&shy;i&shy;ness; it was gra&shy;ve, but self-possessed.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>10:3</sup>&#8239;When the prince called him to em&shy;ploy him in the re&shy;cep&shy;tion of a vis&shy;i&shy;tor, his coun&shy;te&shy;nance ap&shy;peared to change, and his legs to move for&shy;ward with dif&shy;fi&shy;cul&shy;ty.  He in&shy;clined him&shy;self to the oth&shy;er of&shy;fic&shy;ers a&shy;mong whom he stood, mov&shy;ing his left or right arm, as their po&shy;si&shy;tion re&shy;quired, but keep&shy;ing the skirts of his robe be&shy;fore and be&shy;hind e&shy;ven&shy;ly ad&shy;justed.  He has&shy;tened for&shy;ward, with his arms like the wings of a bird.  When the guest had re&shy;tired, he would re&shy;port to the prince, &#x02BC;The vis&shy;i&shy;tor is not turn&shy;ing round any more.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>10:4</sup>&#8239;When he en&shy;tered the pal&shy;ace gate, he seemed to bend his bod&shy;y, as if it were not suf&shy;fi&shy;cient to ad&shy;mit him.  When he was stand&shy;ing, he did not oc&shy;cu&shy;py the mid&shy;dle of the gate-way; when he passed in or out, he did not tread up&shy;on the thresh&shy;old.  When he was pass&shy;ing the va&shy;cant place of the prince, his coun&shy;te&shy;nance ap&shy;peared to change, and his legs to bend un&shy;der him, and his words came as if he hard&shy;ly had breath to ut&shy;ter them.  He as&shy;cended the re&shy;cep&shy;tion hall, hold&shy;ing up his robe with both his hands, and his bod&shy;y bent; hold&shy;ing in his breath al&shy;so, as if he dared not breathe.  When he came out from the au&shy;di&shy;ence, as soon as he had de&shy;scended one step, he be&shy;gan to re&shy;lax his coun&shy;te&shy;nance, and had a sat&shy;is&shy;fied look. When he had got to the bot&shy;tom of the steps, he ad&shy;vanced rap&shy;id&shy;ly to his place, with his arms like wings, and on occupying it, his man&shy;ner still showed re&shy;spect&shy;ful un&shy;eas&shy;i&shy;ness.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>10:5</sup>&#8239;When he was car&shy;ry&shy;ing the scep&shy;ter of his rul&shy;er, he seemed to bend his bod&shy;y, as if he were not a&shy;ble to bear its weight.  He did not hold it higher than the po&shy;si&shy;tion of the hands in mak&shy;ing a bow, nor low&shy;er than their po&shy;si&shy;tion in giv&shy;ing any&shy;thing to an&shy;oth&shy;er.  His coun&shy;te&shy;nance seemed to change, and look ap&shy;pre&shy;hen&shy;sive, and he dragged his feet a&shy;long as if they were held by some&shy;thing to the ground.  In presenting the pres&shy;ents with which he was charged, he wore a plac&shy;id ap&shy;pear&shy;ance.  At his pri&shy;vate au&shy;di&shy;ence, he looked high&shy;ly pleased.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>10:6</sup>&#8239;The su&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;or man did not use a deep pur&shy;ple, or a puce colour, in the or&shy;na&shy;ments of his dress.  E&shy;ven in his un&shy;dress, he did not wear any&shy;thing of a red or red&shy;dish colour.  In warm weath&shy;er, he had a sin&shy;gle gar&shy;ment ei&shy;ther of coarse or fi&shy;ne tex&shy;ture, but he wore it dis&shy;played o&shy;ver an in&shy;ner gar&shy;ment.  O&shy;ver lamb&#x02BC;s fur he wore a gar&shy;ment of black; o&shy;ver fawn&#x02BC;s fur one of white; and o&shy;ver fox&#x02BC;s fur one of yel&shy;low.  The fur robe of his un&shy;dress was long, with the right sleeve short.  He re&shy;quired his sleep&shy;ing dress to be half as long a&shy;gain as his bod&shy;y.  When stay&shy;ing at home, he used thick furs of the fox or the badg&shy;er.  When he put off mourn&shy;ing, he wore all the ap&shy;pend&shy;ages of the gir&shy;dle.  His un&shy;der-garment, ex&shy;cept when it was re&shy;quired to be of the cur&shy;tain shape, was made of silk cut nar&shy;row a&shy;bove and wide be&shy;low.  He did not wear lamb&#x02BC;s fur or a black cap, on a vis&shy;it of con&shy;do&shy;lence.  On the first day of the month he put on his court robes, and pre&shy;sented him&shy;self at court.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>10:7</sup>&#8239;When fasting, he thought it nec&shy;es&shy;sar&shy;y to have his clothes bright&shy;ly clean and made of lin&shy;en cloth.  When fasting, he thought it nec&shy;es&shy;sar&shy;y to change his food, and al&shy;so to change the place where he com&shy;mon&shy;ly sat in the a&shy;part&shy;ment.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>10:8</sup>&#8239;He did not dis&shy;like to have his rice fine&shy;ly cleaned, nor to have his minced meat cut quite small.  He did not eat rice which had been in&shy;jured by heat or damp and turned sour, nor fish or flesh which was gone. He did not eat what was discoloured, or what was of a bad fla&shy;vour, nor any&shy;thing which was ill-cooked, or was not in sea&shy;son.  He did not eat meat which was not cut prop&shy;er&shy;ly, nor what was served with&shy;out its prop&shy;er sauce.  Though there might be a large quan&shy;ti&shy;ty of meat, he would not al&shy;low what he took to ex&shy;ceed the due pro&shy;por&shy;tion for the rice. It was on&shy;ly in wine that he laid down no lim&shy;it for him&shy;self, but he did not al&shy;low him&shy;self to be con&shy;fused by it.  He did not par&shy;take of wine and dried meat bought in the mar&shy;ket.  He was nev&shy;er with&shy;out gin&shy;ger when he ate.  He did not eat much.  When he had been assisting at the prince&#x02BC;s sac&shy;ri&shy;fice, he did not keep the flesh which he re&shy;ceived o&shy;ver&shy;night. The flesh of his fam&shy;i&shy;ly sac&shy;ri&shy;fice he did not keep o&shy;ver three days. If kept o&shy;ver three days, peo&shy;ple could not eat it. When eat&shy;ing, he did not con&shy;verse. When in bed, he did not speak. Al&shy;though his food might be coarse rice and veg&shy;e&shy;ta&shy;ble soup, he would of&shy;fer a lit&shy;tle of it in sac&shy;ri&shy;fice with a gra&shy;ve, re&shy;spect&shy;ful air.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>10:9</sup>&#8239;If his mat was not straight, he did not sit on it.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>10:10</sup>&#8239;When the vil&shy;lag&shy;ers were drink&shy;ing to&shy;geth&shy;er, on those who car&shy;ried staffs go&shy;ing out, he went out im&shy;me&shy;di&shy;ate&shy;ly af&shy;ter.  When the vil&shy;lag&shy;ers were go&shy;ing through their ceremonies to drive a&shy;way pes&shy;ti&shy;len&shy;tial in&shy;flu&shy;ences, he put on his court robes and stood on the east&shy;ern steps.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>10:11</sup>&#8239;When he was send&shy;ing com&shy;pli&shy;men&shy;ta&shy;ry in&shy;quir&shy;ies to any one in an&shy;oth&shy;er State, he bowed twice as he es&shy;corted the mes&shy;sen&shy;ger a&shy;way.  Chi K&#x02BC;ang hav&shy;ing sent him a pres&shy;ent of phys&shy;ic, he bowed and re&shy;ceived it, say&shy;ing, &#x02BC;I do not know it. I dare not taste it.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>10:12</sup>&#8239;The sta&shy;ble be&shy;ing burned down, when he was at court, on his re&shy;turn he said, &#x02BC;Has any man been hurt?&#x02BC; He did not ask a&shy;bout the hors&shy;es.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>10:13</sup>&#8239;When the prince sent him a gift of cooked meat, he would ad&shy;just his mat, first taste it, and then give it a&shy;way to oth&shy;ers. When the prince sent him a gift of un&shy;dressed meat, he would have it cooked, and of&shy;fer it to the spir&shy;its of his an&shy;ces&shy;tors.  When the prince sent him a gift of a liv&shy;ing an&shy;i&shy;mal, he would keep it a&shy;live.  When he was in at&shy;tend&shy;ance on the prince and joining in the en&shy;ter&shy;tain&shy;ment, the prince on&shy;ly sacrificed. He first tast&shy;ed eve&shy;ry&shy;thing.  When he was ill and the prince came to vis&shy;it him, he had his head to the east, made his court robes be spread o&shy;ver him, and drew his gir&shy;dle a&shy;cross them.  When the prince&#x02BC;s or&shy;der called him, with&shy;out waiting for his car&shy;riage to be yoked, he went at once.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>10:14</sup>&#8239;When he en&shy;tered the an&shy;ces&shy;tral tem&shy;ple of the State, he asked a&shy;bout eve&shy;ry&shy;thing.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>10:15</sup>&#8239;When any of his friends died, if he had no re&shy;la&shy;tions who could be de&shy;pended on for the nec&shy;es&shy;sar&shy;y of&shy;fices, he would say, &#x02BC;I will bur&shy;y him.&#x02BC; When a friend sent him a pres&shy;ent, though it might be a car&shy;riage and hors&shy;es, he did not bow.  The on&shy;ly pres&shy;ent for which he bowed was that of the flesh of sac&shy;ri&shy;fice.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>10:16</sup>&#8239;In bed, he did not lie like a corpse. At home, he did not put on any for&shy;mal de&shy;port&shy;ment.  When he saw any one in a mourn&shy;ing dress, though it might be an ac&shy;quaint&shy;ance, he would change coun&shy;te&shy;nance; when he saw any one wear&shy;ing the cap of full dress, or a blind per&shy;son, though he might be in his un&shy;dress, he would sa&shy;lute them in a cer&shy;e&shy;mo&shy;ni&shy;ous man&shy;ner.  To any per&shy;son in mourn&shy;ing he bowed for&shy;ward to the cross&shy;bar of his car&shy;riage; he bowed in the same way to any one bear&shy;ing the ta&shy;bles of pop&shy;u&shy;la&shy;tion.  When he was at an en&shy;ter&shy;tain&shy;ment where there was an a&shy;bun&shy;dance of pro&shy;vi&shy;sions set be&shy;fore him, he would change coun&shy;te&shy;nance and rise up.  On a sud&shy;den clap of thun&shy;der, or a vi&shy;o&shy;lent wind, he would change coun&shy;te&shy;nance.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>10:17</sup>&#8239;When he was a&shy;bout to mount his car&shy;riage, he would stand straight, hold&shy;ing the cord.  When he was in the car&shy;riage, he did not turn his head quite round, he did not talk hast&shy;i&shy;ly, he did not point with his hands.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>10:18</sup>&#8239;See&shy;ing the coun&shy;te&shy;nance, it in&shy;stant&shy;ly rises. It flies round, and by and by set&shy;tles.  The Mas&shy;ter said, &#x02BC;There is the hen-pheasant on the hill bridge. At its sea&shy;son! At its sea&shy;son!&#x02BC; Tsze-lu made a mo&shy;tion to it.  Thrice it smelt him and then rose.

    <sup>11:1</sup>&#8239;The Mas&shy;ter said, &#x02BC;The men of form&shy;er times, in the mat&shy;ters of ceremonies and mu&shy;sic were rus&shy;tics, it is said, while the men of these lat&shy;ter times, in ceremonies and mu&shy;sic, are ac&shy;com&shy;plished gentlemen.  &#x02BC;If I have oc&shy;ca&shy;sion to use those things, I fol&shy;low the men of form&shy;er times.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>11:2</sup>&#8239;The Mas&shy;ter said, &#x02BC;Of those who were with me in Ch&#x02BC;an and Ts&#x02BC;ai, there are none to be found to en&shy;ter my door.&#x02BC; Dis&shy;tin&shy;guished for their vir&shy;tu&shy;ous prin&shy;ci&shy;ples and prac&shy;tice, there were Yen Yu&shy;an, Min Tsze-ch&#x02BC;ien, Zan Po-niu, and Chung-kung;  for their a&shy;bil&shy;i&shy;ty in speech, Tsai Wo and Tsze-kung; for their ad&shy;min&shy;is&shy;tra&shy;tive tal&shy;ents, Zan Yu and Chi Lu; for their lit&shy;er&shy;ar&shy;y ac&shy;quire&shy;ments, Tsze-yu and Tsze-hsia.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>11:3</sup>&#8239;The Mas&shy;ter said, &#x02BC;Hui gives me no as&shy;sis&shy;tance. There is noth&shy;ing that I say in which he does not de&shy;light.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>11:4</sup>&#8239;The Mas&shy;ter said, &#x02BC;Filial in&shy;deed is Min Tsze-ch&#x02BC;ien!  Oth&shy;er peo&shy;ple say noth&shy;ing of him dif&shy;fer&shy;ent from the re&shy;port of his par&shy;ents and broth&shy;ers.&#x02BC;

<p>
    <sup>11:5</sup>&#8239;Nan Yung was fre&shy;quent&shy;ly repeating the lines a&shy;bout a white scep&shy;ter stone. Confucius gave him the daugh&shy;ter of his eld&shy;er broth&shy;er to wife.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>11:6</sup>&#8239;Chi K&#x02BC;ang asked which of the dis&shy;ci&shy;ples loved to learn. Confucius replied to him, &#x02BC;There was Yen Hui; he loved to learn. Un&shy;for&shy;tu&shy;nate&shy;ly his ap&shy;point&shy;ed time was short, and he died.  Now there is no one who loves to learn, as he did.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>11:7</sup>&#8239;When Yen Yu&shy;an died, Yen Lu begged the car&shy;riage of the Mas&shy;ter to sell and get an out&shy;er shell for his son&#x02BC;s cof&shy;fin.  The Mas&shy;ter said, &#x02BC;Every one calls his son his son, wheth&shy;er he has tal&shy;ents or has not tal&shy;ents. There was Li; when he died, he had a cof&shy;fin but no out&shy;er shell. I would not walk on foot to get a shell for him, be&shy;cause, hav&shy;ing fol&shy;lowed in the rear of the great of&shy;fic&shy;ers, it was not prop&shy;er that I should walk on foot.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>11:8</sup>&#8239;When Yen Yu&shy;an died, the Mas&shy;ter said, &#x02BC;Alas!  Heav&shy;en is destroying me! Heav&shy;en is destroying me!&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>11:9</sup>&#8239;When Yen Yu&shy;an died, the Mas&shy;ter be&shy;wailed him ex&shy;ceed&shy;ing&shy;ly, and the dis&shy;ci&shy;ples who were with him said, &#x02BC;Master, your grief is ex&shy;ces&shy;sive?&#x02BC; &#x02BC;Is it ex&shy;ces&shy;sive?&#x02BC; said he.  &#x02BC;If I am not to mourn bit&shy;ter&shy;ly for this man, for whom should I mourn?&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>11:10</sup>&#8239;When Yen Yu&shy;an died, the dis&shy;ci&shy;ples wished to give him a great fu&shy;ner&shy;al, and the Mas&shy;ter said, &#x02BC;You may not do so.&#x02BC; The dis&shy;ci&shy;ples did bur&shy;y him in great style.  The Mas&shy;ter said, &#x02BC;Hui be&shy;haved to&shy;wards me as his fa&shy;ther. I have not been a&shy;ble to treat him as my son. The fault is not mine; it be&shy;longs to you, O dis&shy;ci&shy;ples.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>11:11</sup>&#8239;Chi Lu asked a&shy;bout serv&shy;ing the spir&shy;its of the dead.  The Mas&shy;ter said, &#x02BC;While you are not a&shy;ble to serve men, how can you serve their spir&shy;its?&#x02BC; Chi Lu added, &#x02BC;I ven&shy;ture to ask a&shy;bout death?&#x02BC; He was an&shy;swered, &#x02BC;While you do not know life, how can you know a&shy;bout death?&#x02BC;

The Mas&shy;ter was pleased.  He said, &#x02BC;Yu, there!-- he will not die a nat&shy;u&shy;ral death.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>11:13</sup>&#8239;Some parties in Lu were go&shy;ing to take down and re&shy;build the Long Treas&shy;ur&shy;y.

<p>
    <sup>11:15</sup>&#8239;Tsze-kung asked which of the two, Shih or Shang, was the su&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;or.

    <sup>15:3</sup>&#8239;The Mas&shy;ter said, &#x02BC;Yu, those who know vir&shy;tue are few.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>15:4</sup>&#8239;The Mas&shy;ter said, &#x02BC;May not Shun be in&shy;stanced as hav&shy;ing gov&shy;erned ef&shy;fi&shy;cient&shy;ly with&shy;out ex&shy;er&shy;tion? What did he do? He did noth&shy;ing but grave&shy;ly and reverently oc&shy;cu&shy;py his roy&shy;al seat.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>15:5</sup>&#8239;Tsze-chang asked how a man should con&shy;duct him&shy;self, so as to be eve&shy;ry&shy;where ap&shy;pre&shy;ci&shy;at&shy;ed.  The Mas&shy;ter said, &#x02BC;Let his words be sin&shy;cere and truth&shy;ful, and his ac&shy;tions honourable and care&shy;ful;-- such con&shy;duct may be prac&shy;tised a&shy;mong the rude tribes of the South or the North. If his words be not sin&shy;cere and truth&shy;ful and his ac&shy;tions not honourable and care&shy;ful, will he, with such con&shy;duct, be ap&shy;pre&shy;ci&shy;at&shy;ed, e&shy;ven in his neigh&shy;bor&shy;hood?  &#x02BC;When he is stand&shy;ing, let him see those two things, as it were, fronting him. When he is in a car&shy;riage, let him see them at&shy;tached to the yoke. Then may he sub&shy;se&shy;quent&shy;ly car&shy;ry them in&shy;to prac&shy;tice.&#x02BC; Tsze-chang wrote these coun&shy;sels on the end of his sash.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>15:6</sup>&#8239;The Mas&shy;ter said, &#x02BC;Truly straight&shy;for&shy;ward was the his&shy;to&shy;ri&shy;og&shy;ra&shy;pher Yu. When good gov&shy;ern&shy;ment pre&shy;vailed in his State, he was like an ar&shy;row. When bad gov&shy;ern&shy;ment pre&shy;vailed, he was like an ar&shy;row.  A su&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;or man in&shy;deed is Chu Po-yu! When good gov&shy;ern&shy;ment pre&shy;vails in his state, he is to be found in of&shy;fice. When bad gov&shy;ern&shy;ment pre&shy;vails, he can roll his prin&shy;ci&shy;ples up, and keep them in his breast.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>15:7</sup>&#8239;The Mas&shy;ter said, &#x02BC;When a man may be spo&shy;ken with, not to speak to him is to err in ref&shy;er&shy;ence to the man. When a man may not be spo&shy;ken with, to speak to him is to err in ref&shy;er&shy;ence to our words. The wise err nei&shy;ther in re&shy;gard to their man nor to their words.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>15:8</sup>&#8239;The Mas&shy;ter said, &#x02BC;The de&shy;ter&shy;mined schol&shy;ar and the man of vir&shy;tue will not seek to live at the ex&shy;pense of in&shy;jur&shy;ing their vir&shy;tue. They will e&shy;ven sac&shy;ri&shy;fice their lives to pre&shy;serve their vir&shy;tue com&shy;plete.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>15:9</sup>&#8239;Tsze-kung asked a&shy;bout the prac&shy;tice of vir&shy;tue. The Mas&shy;ter said, &#x02BC;The me&shy;chan&shy;ic, who wishes to do his work well, must first sharp&shy;en his tools. When you are liv&shy;ing in any state, take serv&shy;ice with the most wor&shy;thy a&shy;mong its great of&shy;fic&shy;ers, and make friends of the most vir&shy;tu&shy;ous a&shy;mong its schol&shy;ars.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>15:10</sup>&#8239;Yen Yu&shy;an asked how the gov&shy;ern&shy;ment of a coun&shy;try should be ad&shy;min&shy;is&shy;tered.  The Mas&shy;ter said, &#x02BC;Follow the sea&shy;sons of Hsia. &#x02BC;Ride in the state car&shy;riage of Yin.  &#x02BC;Wear the cer&shy;e&shy;mo&shy;ni&shy;al cap of Chau.  &#x02BC;Let the mu&shy;sic be the Shao with its pan&shy;to&shy;mimes.  Ban&shy;ish the songs of Chang, and keep far from spe&shy;cious talk&shy;ers. The songs of Chang are li&shy;cen&shy;tious; spe&shy;cious talk&shy;ers are dan&shy;ger&shy;ous.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>15:11</sup>&#8239;The Mas&shy;ter said, &#x02BC;If a man take no thought a&shy;bout what is dis&shy;tant, he will find sor&shy;row near at hand.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>15:12</sup>&#8239;The Mas&shy;ter said, &#x02BC;It is all o&shy;ver! I have not seen one who loves vir&shy;tue as he loves beau&shy;ty.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>15:13</sup>&#8239;The Mas&shy;ter said, &#x02BC;Was not Tsang Wan like one who had stol&shy;en his sit&shy;u&shy;a&shy;tion? He knew the vir&shy;tue and the tal&shy;ents of Hui of Liu-hsia, and yet did not pro&shy;cure that he should stand with him in court.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>15:14</sup>&#8239;The Mas&shy;ter said, &#x02BC;He who re&shy;quires much from him&shy;self and lit&shy;tle from oth&shy;ers, will keep him&shy;self from be&shy;ing the ob&shy;ject of re&shy;sent&shy;ment.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>15:15</sup>&#8239;The Mas&shy;ter said, &#x02BC;When a man is not in the hab&shy;it of say&shy;ing-- "What shall I think of this? What shall I think of this?" I can in&shy;deed do noth&shy;ing with him!&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>15:16</sup>&#8239;The Mas&shy;ter said, &#x02BC;When a num&shy;ber of peo&shy;ple are to&shy;geth&shy;er, for a whole day, with&shy;out their con&shy;ver&shy;sa&shy;tion turn&shy;ing on right&shy;eous&shy;ness, and when they are fond of car&shy;ry&shy;ing out the sug&shy;ges&shy;tions of a small shrewd&shy;ness;-- theirs is in&shy;deed a hard case.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>15:17</sup>&#8239;The Mas&shy;ter said, &#x02BC;The su&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;or man in eve&shy;ry&shy;thing con&shy;sid&shy;ers right&shy;eous&shy;ness to be es&shy;sen&shy;tial. He per&shy;forms it ac&shy;cord&shy;ing to the rules of pro&shy;pri&shy;e&shy;ty. He brings it forth in hu&shy;mil&shy;i&shy;ty. He com&shy;pletes it with sin&shy;cer&shy;i&shy;ty. This is in&shy;deed a su&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;or man.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>15:18</sup>&#8239;The Mas&shy;ter said, &#x02BC;The su&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;or man is dis&shy;tressed by his want of a&shy;bil&shy;i&shy;ty. He is not dis&shy;tressed by men&#x02BC;s not know&shy;ing him.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>15:19</sup>&#8239;The Mas&shy;ter said, &#x02BC;The su&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;or man dis&shy;likes the thought of his name not be&shy;ing men&shy;tioned af&shy;ter his death.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>15:20</sup>&#8239;The Mas&shy;ter said, &#x02BC;What the su&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;or man seeks, is in him&shy;self. What the mean man seeks, is in oth&shy;ers.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>15:21</sup>&#8239;The Mas&shy;ter said, &#x02BC;The su&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;or man is dig&shy;ni&shy;fied, but does not wran&shy;gle. He is so&shy;cia&shy;ble, but not a par&shy;ti&shy;zan.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>15:22</sup>&#8239;The Mas&shy;ter said, &#x02BC;The su&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;or man does not pro&shy;mote a man simp&shy;ly on ac&shy;count of his words, nor does he put a&shy;side good words be&shy;cause of the man.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>15:23</sup>&#8239;Tsze-kung asked, say&shy;ing, &#x02BC;Is there one word which may serve as a rule of prac&shy;tice for all one&#x02BC;s life?&#x02BC; The Mas&shy;ter said, &#x02BC;Is not RECIPROCITY such a word? What you do not want done to your&shy;self, do not do to oth&shy;ers.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>15:24</sup>&#8239;The Mas&shy;ter said, &#x02BC;In my deal&shy;ings with men, whose evil do I blame, whose good&shy;ness do I praise, be&shy;yond what is prop&shy;er? If I do some&shy;times ex&shy;ceed in praise, there must be ground for it in my ex&shy;am&shy;i&shy;na&shy;tion of the in&shy;di&shy;vid&shy;u&shy;al.  &#x02BC;This peo&shy;ple sup&shy;plied the ground why the three dynasties pur&shy;sued the path of straight&shy;for&shy;ward&shy;ness.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>15:25</sup>&#8239;The Mas&shy;ter said, &#x02BC;Even in my ear&shy;ly days, a his&shy;to&shy;ri&shy;og&shy;ra&shy;pher would leave a blank in his text, and he who had a horse would lend him to an&shy;oth&shy;er to ride. Now, a&shy;las! there are no such things.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>15:26</sup>&#8239;The Mas&shy;ter said, &#x02BC;Specious words con&shy;found vir&shy;tue. Want of for&shy;bear&shy;ance in small mat&shy;ters con&shy;founds great plans.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>15:27</sup>&#8239;The Mas&shy;ter said, &#x02BC;When the mul&shy;ti&shy;tude hate a man, it is nec&shy;es&shy;sar&shy;y to ex&shy;am&shy;ine in&shy;to the case. When the mul&shy;ti&shy;tude like a man, it is nec&shy;es&shy;sar&shy;y to ex&shy;am&shy;ine in&shy;to the case.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>15:28</sup>&#8239;The Mas&shy;ter said, &#x02BC;A man can en&shy;large the prin&shy;ci&shy;ples which he fol&shy;lows; those prin&shy;ci&shy;ples do not en&shy;large the man.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>15:29</sup>&#8239;The Mas&shy;ter said, &#x02BC;To have faults and not to re&shy;form them,-- this, in&shy;deed, should be pro&shy;nounced hav&shy;ing faults.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>15:30</sup>&#8239;The Mas&shy;ter said, &#x02BC;I have been the whole day with&shy;out eat&shy;ing, and the whole night with&shy;out sleep&shy;ing:-- occupied with think&shy;ing. It was of no use. The bet&shy;ter plan is to learn.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>15:31</sup>&#8239;The Mas&shy;ter said, &#x02BC;The ob&shy;ject of the su&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;or man is truth. Food is not his ob&shy;ject. There is plowing;-- e&shy;ven in that there is some&shy;times want. So with learn&shy;ing;-- e&shy;mol&shy;u&shy;ment may be found in it. The su&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;or man is anx&shy;ious lest he should not get truth; he is not anx&shy;ious lest pov&shy;er&shy;ty should come up&shy;on him.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>15:32</sup>&#8239;The Mas&shy;ter said, &#x02BC;When a man&#x02BC;s knowl&shy;edge is suf&shy;fi&shy;cient to at&shy;tain, and his vir&shy;tue is not suf&shy;fi&shy;cient to en&shy;a&shy;ble him to hold, what&shy;ev&shy;er he may have gained, he will lose a&shy;gain.  &#x02BC;When his knowl&shy;edge is suf&shy;fi&shy;cient to at&shy;tain, and he has vir&shy;tue e&shy;nough to hold fast, if he can&shy;not gov&shy;ern with dig&shy;ni&shy;ty, the peo&shy;ple will not re&shy;spect him.  &#x02BC;When his knowl&shy;edge is suf&shy;fi&shy;cient to at&shy;tain, and he has vir&shy;tue e&shy;nough to hold fast; when he gov&shy;erns al&shy;so with dig&shy;ni&shy;ty, yet if he try to move the peo&shy;ple con&shy;tra&shy;ry to the rules of pro&shy;pri&shy;e&shy;ty:-- full ex&shy;cel&shy;lence is not reached.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>15:33</sup>&#8239;The Mas&shy;ter said, &#x02BC;The su&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;or man can&shy;not be known in lit&shy;tle mat&shy;ters; but he may be in&shy;trusted with great con&shy;cerns. The small man may not be in&shy;trusted with great con&shy;cerns, but he may be known in lit&shy;tle mat&shy;ters.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>15:34</sup>&#8239;The Mas&shy;ter said, &#x02BC;Virtue is more to man than ei&shy;ther wa&shy;ter or fire. I have seen men die from tread&shy;ing on wa&shy;ter and fire, but I have nev&shy;er seen a man die from tread&shy;ing the course of vir&shy;tue.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>15:35</sup>&#8239;The Mas&shy;ter said, &#x02BC;Let eve&shy;ry man con&shy;sid&shy;er vir&shy;tue as what de&shy;volves on him&shy;self. He may not yield the per&shy;for&shy;mance of it e&shy;ven to his teach&shy;er.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>15:36</sup>&#8239;The Mas&shy;ter said, &#x02BC;The su&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;or man is cor&shy;rect&shy;ly firm, and not firm mere&shy;ly.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>15:37</sup>&#8239;The Mas&shy;ter said, &#x02BC;A min&shy;is&shy;ter, in serv&shy;ing his prince, reverently dis&shy;charges his duties, and makes his e&shy;mol&shy;u&shy;ment a sec&shy;ond&shy;ar&shy;y con&shy;sid&shy;er&shy;a&shy;tion.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>15:38</sup>&#8239;The Mas&shy;ter said, &#x02BC;In teach&shy;ing there should be no dis&shy;tinc&shy;tion of clas&shy;ses.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>15:39</sup>&#8239;The Mas&shy;ter said, &#x02BC;Those whose cours&shy;es are dif&shy;fer&shy;ent can&shy;not lay plans for one an&shy;oth&shy;er.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>15:40</sup>&#8239;The Mas&shy;ter said, &#x02BC;In lan&shy;guage it is simp&shy;ly re&shy;quired that it con&shy;vey the mean&shy;ing.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>15:41</sup>&#8239;The Mu&shy;sic-master, Mien, hav&shy;ing called up&shy;on him, when they came to the steps, the Mas&shy;ter said, &#x02BC;Here are the steps.&#x02BC; When they came to the mat for the guest to sit up&shy;on, he said, &#x02BC;Here is the mat.&#x02BC; When all were seated, the Mas&shy;ter in&shy;formed him, say&shy;ing, &#x02BC;So and so is here; so and so is here.&#x02BC; The Mu&shy;sic-master, Mien, hav&shy;ing gone out, Tsze-chang asked, say&shy;ing. &#x02BC;Is it the rule to tell those things to the Mu&shy;sic- mas&shy;ter?&#x02BC; The Mas&shy;ter said, &#x02BC;Yes. This is cer&shy;tain&shy;ly the rule for those who lead the blind.&#x02BC;
