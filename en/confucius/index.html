    <p>
    <sup>1:1</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, <q>Isn&#x02BC;t it a pleas&shy;ure to learn some&shy;thing, then to ap&shy;ply it at the right time?  Isn&#x02BC;t it a joy to have friends come from a&shy;far?  Isn&#x02BC;t he a su&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;or man who takes no of&shy;fense when his mer&shy;its are ig&shy;nored?</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>1:2</sup>&#8239;Mas&shy;ter You said, <q>The su&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;or man works on the root, for once the root is es&shy;tab&shy;lished, the Way will grow from it.  Isn&#x02BC;t re&shy;spect for par&shy;ents and el&shy;ders the root of be&shy;nev&shy;o&shy;lence?</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>1:3</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, <q>Cun&shy;ning words and an in&shy;gra&shy;ti&shy;at&shy;ing ap&shy;pear&shy;ance rare&shy;ly ac&shy;com&shy;pa&shy;ny be&shy;nev&shy;o&shy;lence.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>1:4</sup>&#8239;Mas&shy;ter Zeng said, <q>Each day I ex&shy;am&shy;ine my&shy;self on three points. When deal&shy;ing on be&shy;half of oth&shy;ers, have I been loy&shy;al?  In my in&shy;ter&shy;ac&shy;tions with friends, have I been trust&shy;wor&shy;thy?  Have I prac&shy;tised what I was taught?</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>1:5</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, <q>The Way to guide a state of a thou&shy;sand char&shy;i&shy;ots: be at&shy;ten&shy;tive to busi&shy;ness and trust&shy;wor&shy;thy; be fru&shy;gal in ex&shy;pend&shy;i&shy;tures and love your fel&shy;low men; on&shy;ly mo&shy;bi&shy;lize the com&shy;mon peo&shy;ple at the prop&shy;er time of year.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>1:6</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, <q>A young man should re&shy;spect his par&shy;ents at home, re&shy;spect his el&shy;ders a&shy;broad, say lit&shy;tle but be trust&shy;wor&shy;thy, love the peo&shy;ple at large but be in&shy;ti&shy;mate with the be&shy;nev&shy;o&shy;lent. If he still has en&shy;er&shy;gy to spare, let him stud&shy;y lit&shy;er&shy;a&shy;ture.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>1:7</sup>&#8239;Zixia said, <q>Oth&shy;ers may say that a man is un&shy;ed&shy;u&shy;cat&shy;ed, but I call him ed&shy;u&shy;cat&shy;ed if he val&shy;ues vir&shy;tue more than beau&shy;ty, ex&shy;erts his ut&shy;most when serv&shy;ing his par&shy;ents, of&shy;fers his whole per&shy;son when serv&shy;ing his lord, and is trust&shy;wor&shy;thy when speak&shy;ing with friends.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>1:10</sup>&#8239;Ziqin asked Zigong, <q>When our Mas&shy;ter ar&shy;rives in a coun&shy;try, he al&shy;ways learns a&shy;bout its gov&shy;ern&shy;ment.  Does he seek out this in&shy;for&shy;ma&shy;tion or is it giv&shy;en to him?</q>  Zigong replied, <q>Our Mas&shy;ter ob&shy;tains it by be&shy;ing cor&shy;dial, up&shy;right, re&shy;spect&shy;ful, fru&shy;gal, and def&shy;er&shy;en&shy;tial. Our Mas&shy;ter seeks it dif&shy;fer&shy;ent&shy;ly than oth&shy;er men do.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>1:14</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, <q>A su&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;or man seeks nei&shy;ther a full stom&shy;ach nor com&shy;fort&shy;a&shy;ble lodg&shy;ings.  He is dil&shy;i&shy;gent in his ac&shy;tions but cau&shy;tious in his speech.  He as&shy;so&shy;ci&shy;ates with those who know the Way in or&shy;der to be put right.  Such a man may be said to love learn&shy;ing.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>1:15</sup>&#8239;Zigong asked, <q>What do you think of the say&shy;ing, <q>Poor with&shy;out grov&shy;el&shy;ing, rich with&shy;out ar&shy;ro&shy;gance</q>?</q> The Mas&shy;ter replied, <q>Not bad, but bet&shy;ter still, <q>Poor but enjoying the Way, rich but lov&shy;ing pro&shy;pri&shy;e&shy;ty.</q></q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>1:16</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, <q>Don&#x02BC;t wor&shy;ry that men don&#x02BC;t rec&shy;og&shy;nize your mer&shy;its; wor&shy;ry that you don&#x02BC;t rec&shy;og&shy;nize theirs.</q>
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>2:1</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, <q>He who gov&shy;erns by vir&shy;tue is like the North Star: it stays in its place while all the oth&shy;er stars pay hom&shy;age to it.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:3</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, <q>Lead the peo&shy;ple with e&shy;dicts, keep them or&shy;der&shy;ly with pun&shy;ish&shy;ments: they will e&shy;vade the pun&shy;ish&shy;ment and have no sense of shame.  Lead them with vir&shy;tue, keep them or&shy;der&shy;ly with pro&shy;pri&shy;e&shy;ty: they will have a sense of shame and or&shy;der them&shy;selves.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:6</sup>&#8239;Meng Wubo asked a&shy;bout fil&shy;ial pi&shy;e&shy;ty. Confucius said, <q>Give your par&shy;ents noth&shy;ing to wor&shy;ry a&shy;bout oth&shy;er than ill&shy;ness.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:7</sup>&#8239;Ziyou asked a&shy;bout fil&shy;ial pi&shy;e&shy;ty. Confucius said, <q>Now&shy;a&shy;days fil&shy;ial pi&shy;e&shy;ty on&shy;ly means be&shy;ing a&shy;ble to feed your par&shy;ents.  But e&shy;ven dogs and hors&shy;es re&shy;ceive this much care.  With&shy;out re&shy;spect, what&#x02BC;s the dif&shy;fer&shy;ence?</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:8</sup>&#8239;Zixia asked a&shy;bout fil&shy;ial pi&shy;e&shy;ty. Confucius said, <q>It&#x02BC;s the ex&shy;pres&shy;sion on your face that&#x02BC;s dif&shy;fi&shy;cult to man&shy;age.  It&#x02BC;s not fil&shy;ial pi&shy;e&shy;ty mere&shy;ly for the young to shoul&shy;der the bur&shy;den when there is work to do, and to de&shy;fer to their el&shy;ders when there is wine and food a&shy;vail&shy;a&shy;ble.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:10</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, <q>Look at the means a man em&shy;ploys.  Ob&shy;serve his mo&shy;tives. Ex&shy;am&shy;ine what gives him com&shy;fort.  How can a man con&shy;ceal his char&shy;ac&shy;ter?</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:11</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, <q>If a man learns the new by reviewing the old, he is wor&shy;thy to be a teach&shy;er.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:13</sup>&#8239;Zigong asked a&shy;bout the su&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;or man. Confucius said, <q>He acts be&shy;fore he speaks, and then speaks ac&shy;cord&shy;ing to his ac&shy;tions.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:14</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, <q>The su&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;or man is in&shy;clu&shy;sive and not par&shy;ti&shy;san.  The in&shy;fe&shy;ri&shy;or man is par&shy;ti&shy;san and not in&shy;clu&shy;sive.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:15</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, <q>Learn&shy;ing with&shy;out think&shy;ing is a waste.  Think&shy;ing with&shy;out learn&shy;ing is dan&shy;ger&shy;ous.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:17</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, <q>Knowl&shy;edge is to know when you know some&shy;thing, and to know when you don&#x02BC;t.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:18</sup>&#8239;Zizhang was stud&shy;y&shy;ing in or&shy;der to get an of&shy;fi&shy;cial po&shy;si&shy;tion. Confucius said, <q>If you lis&shy;ten much, put a&shy;side what is doubt&shy;ful, and speak cau&shy;tious&shy;ly a&shy;bout the rest, you will make few mis&shy;takes.  If you ob&shy;serve much, put a&shy;side what is per&shy;i&shy;lous, and act cau&shy;tious&shy;ly on the rest, you will have few re&shy;grets.  Few mis&shy;takes in speech, few re&shy;grets in ac&shy;tion: an of&shy;fi&shy;cial po&shy;si&shy;tion will fol&shy;low.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:19</sup>&#8239;Duke A&shy;i asked, <q>What should I do so that the peo&shy;ple fol&shy;low me?</q> Confucius said, <q>If you raise up the straight and place them o&shy;ver the crook&shy;ed, the peo&shy;ple will fol&shy;low you.  If you raise up the crook&shy;ed and place them o&shy;ver the straight, the peo&shy;ple will not fol&shy;low you.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:20</sup>&#8239;Ji Kangzi asked, <q>How can I en&shy;cour&shy;age the peo&shy;ple to be re&shy;spect&shy;ful, loy&shy;al, and dil&shy;i&shy;gent?</q>  Confucius said, <q>Ap&shy;proach them with dig&shy;ni&shy;ty then they will be re&shy;spect&shy;ful.  Be fil&shy;ial and kind then they will be loy&shy;al.  Raise up the good and in&shy;struct the in&shy;com&shy;pe&shy;tent then they will be dil&shy;i&shy;gent.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:21</sup>&#8239;Some&shy;one asked Confucius, <q>Why don&#x02BC;t you en&shy;gage in gov&shy;ern&shy;ment?</q> Confucius said, <q>The Book of Doc&shy;u&shy;ments says, <q>Just by be&shy;ing fil&shy;ial and be&shy;ing friend&shy;ly to your broth&shy;ers you will have an ef&shy;fect on gov&shy;ern&shy;ment.</q>  Since this is al&shy;so en&shy;gag&shy;ing in gov&shy;ern&shy;ment, why do I need to <q>en&shy;gage in gov&shy;ern&shy;ment</q>?</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:22</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, <q>I don&#x02BC;t know what to do with an un&shy;trust&shy;wor&shy;thy man. How can you pull a wag&shy;on that&#x02BC;s mis&shy;sing its yoke pin?</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:24</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, <q>To sac&shy;ri&shy;fice to an&shy;ces&shy;tral spir&shy;its oth&shy;er than your own is flat&shy;ter&shy;y.  To see what is right and not to do it is a lack of cour&shy;age.</q>
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>3:3</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, <q>If a man is not be&shy;nev&shy;o&shy;lent, what can he do with pro&shy;pri&shy;e&shy;ty?</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>3:4</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, <q>In rit&shy;u&shy;al, pre&shy;fer fru&shy;gal&shy;i&shy;ty to ex&shy;trav&shy;a&shy;gance.  In fu&shy;ner&shy;als, pre&shy;fer grief to for&shy;mal&shy;i&shy;ty.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>3:7</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, <q>A su&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;or man is not com&shy;pet&shy;i&shy;tive. If he must com&shy;pete, let it be at ar&shy;cher&shy;y.  He as&shy;cends to his po&shy;si&shy;tion and bows in def&shy;er&shy;ence.  Af&shy;ter&shy;wards, he de&shy;scends and drinks a sa&shy;lute.  E&shy;ven in com&shy;pe&shy;ti&shy;tion he is a su&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;or man.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>3:12</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, <q>If I don&#x02BC;t par&shy;tic&shy;i&shy;pate in a sac&shy;ri&shy;fice, it&#x02BC;s as if I have not sacrificed at all.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>3:15</sup>&#8239;When Confucius en&shy;tered the Grand Tem&shy;ple, he asked ques&shy;tions a&shy;bout eve&shy;ry&shy;thing. Some&shy;one re&shy;marked, <q>Who says that Confucius knows a&shy;bout rit&shy;u&shy;al? When visiting the Grand Tem&shy;ple, he asked ques&shy;tions a&shy;bout eve&shy;ry&shy;thing.</q> Confucius, hear&shy;ing this, said, <q>This is the rit&shy;u&shy;al.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>3:21</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, <q>Don&#x02BC;t ex&shy;plain a&shy;way what is al&shy;read&shy;y done.  Don&#x02BC;t ar&shy;gue a&shy;gainst what is al&shy;read&shy;y ac&shy;com&shy;plished.  Don&#x02BC;t as&shy;sign blame for what is al&shy;read&shy;y past.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>3:26</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, <q>Hold&shy;ing a high po&shy;si&shy;tion with&shy;out tol&shy;er&shy;ance, per&shy;form&shy;ing rit&shy;u&shy;al with&shy;out rev&shy;er&shy;ence, joining a fu&shy;ner&shy;al with&shy;out grief: how can I look at such things?</q>
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>4:1</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, <q>It is be&shy;nev&shy;o&shy;lence that makes a neigh&shy;bor&shy;hood beau&shy;ti&shy;ful. How can a man be con&shy;sid&shy;ered wise if he chooses not to re&shy;side a&shy;mong be&shy;nev&shy;o&shy;lence?</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>4:2</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, <q>Those who lack be&shy;nev&shy;o&shy;lence can en&shy;dure nei&shy;ther ad&shy;ver&shy;si&shy;ty nor en&shy;joy&shy;ment for long. The be&shy;nev&shy;o&shy;lent are con&shy;tent with be&shy;nev&shy;o&shy;lence. The wise cul&shy;ti&shy;vate be&shy;nev&shy;o&shy;lence for its ad&shy;van&shy;tage.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>4:4</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, <q>If you set your heart on be&shy;nev&shy;o&shy;lence, you will be free from evil.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>4:5</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, <q>All men de&shy;sire wealth and hon&shy;or, but if they are ob&shy;tained by not fol&shy;low&shy;ing the Way, they should not be kept. All men hate pov&shy;er&shy;ty and dis&shy;grace, but if they can&#x02BC;t be a&shy;voided by fol&shy;low&shy;ing the Way, they should not be a&shy;voided.  If a su&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;or man a&shy;ban&shy;dons be&shy;nev&shy;o&shy;lence, how is he wor&shy;thy of that name?  A su&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;or man nev&shy;er leaves be&shy;nev&shy;o&shy;lence e&shy;ven for the space of a sin&shy;gle meal.  In mo&shy;ments of haste, he acts ac&shy;cord&shy;ing to it.  In times of dif&shy;fi&shy;cul&shy;ty, he acts ac&shy;cord&shy;ing to it.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>4:6</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, <q>One who re&shy;al&shy;ly loves be&shy;nev&shy;o&shy;lence puts noth&shy;ing a&shy;bove it. One who re&shy;al&shy;ly hates what is not be&shy;nev&shy;o&shy;lent would not al&shy;low it to ap&shy;proach him.  Has any&shy;one de&shy;vot&shy;ed all his strength to be&shy;nev&shy;o&shy;lence for a sin&shy;gle day?  I hav&shy;en&#x02BC;t seen any&shy;one who lacked the strength to do so.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>4:7</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, <q>Peo&shy;ple make er&shy;rors ac&shy;cord&shy;ing to the type of per&shy;son they are.  Ob&shy;serve their er&shy;rors and you can know their de&shy;gree of be&shy;nev&shy;o&shy;lence.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>4:9</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, <q>A gen&shy;tle&shy;man who sets his heart on the Way, but is a&shy;shamed of poor clothes and poor food, is not worth en&shy;gag&shy;ing in dis&shy;cus&shy;sion.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>4:10</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, <q>When a su&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;or man deals with the world he is not in&shy;var&shy;i&shy;a&shy;bly for or a&shy;gainst any&shy;thing.  He sides with what is right.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>4:11</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, <q>A su&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;or man cherishes vir&shy;tue; an in&shy;fe&shy;ri&shy;or man cherishes land.  A su&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;or man cherishes jus&shy;tice; an in&shy;fe&shy;ri&shy;or man cherishes fa&shy;vors.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>4:12</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, <q>One who acts out of per&shy;son&shy;al prof&shy;it in&shy;curs much re&shy;sent&shy;ment.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>4:14</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, <q>Don&#x02BC;t wor&shy;ry that you have no po&shy;si&shy;tion; wor&shy;ry a&shy;bout what it takes to mer&shy;it one.  Don&#x02BC;t wor&shy;ry that no one knows you; seek to be worth know&shy;ing.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>4:16</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, <q>A su&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;or man un&shy;der&shy;stands what is right.  An in&shy;fe&shy;ri&shy;or man un&shy;der&shy;stands per&shy;son&shy;al prof&shy;it.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>4:17</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, <q>When you see a wor&shy;thy man, think of be&shy;com&shy;ing his e&shy;qual; when you see an un&shy;wor&shy;thy man, look with&shy;in and ex&shy;am&shy;ine your&shy;self.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>4:18</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, <q>In serv&shy;ing your par&shy;ents, you may ad&shy;mon&shy;ish them gen&shy;tly; if you see that they don&#x02BC;t fol&shy;low your ad&shy;vice, re&shy;main re&shy;spect&shy;ful, don&#x02BC;t be&shy;come dis&shy;o&shy;be&shy;di&shy;ent, and work with&shy;out complaining.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>4:22</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, <q>The an&shy;cients were re&shy;luc&shy;tant to speak, be&shy;cause they would be a&shy;shamed if their ac&shy;tions did not live up to their words.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>4:23</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, <q>One rare&shy;ly miss&shy;es the mark be&shy;cause of self-control.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>4:24</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, <q>A su&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;or man wants to be slow in speech but quick in ac&shy;tion.</q>

<p>
    <sup>5:5</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, <q>What is the use of el&shy;o&shy;quence?  Those who give a quick re&shy;tort of&shy;ten in&shy;cur the ha&shy;tred of oth&shy;ers.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>5:10</sup>&#8239;Zai Yu was sleep&shy;ing dur&shy;ing the day. Confucius said, <q>Rot&shy;ten wood can&shy;not be carved, and a wall of ma&shy;nure can&shy;not be trow&shy;elled. What is the use of scolding Zai Yu?  I used to lis&shy;ten to what peo&shy;ple said and trust them to act ac&shy;cord&shy;ing&shy;ly.  Now I lis&shy;ten to what peo&shy;ple say and watch what they do.  It is be&shy;cause of Zai Yu that I have changed.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>5:11</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, <q>I hav&shy;en&#x02BC;t seen a tru&shy;ly stead&shy;fast man. How can a man who is full of de&shy;sires be stead&shy;fast?</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>5:15</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, <q>Kong the Re&shy;fined was men&shy;tal&shy;ly quick, fond of learn&shy;ing, and not a&shy;shamed to ask ques&shy;tions of his in&shy;fe&shy;ri&shy;ors. That is why he was giv&shy;en the post&shy;hu&shy;mous ti&shy;tle of <q>Re&shy;fined</q>.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>5:16</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, <q>Zi Chan had four char&shy;ac&shy;ter&shy;is&shy;tics of the Way of a su&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;or man: he was re&shy;spect&shy;ful in his pri&shy;vate con&shy;duct, re&shy;spect&shy;ful in serv&shy;ing his su&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;ors, gen&shy;er&shy;ous in car&shy;ing for the peo&shy;ple, and just in employing the peo&shy;ple.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>5:17</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, <q>Yang Ping Zhong ex&shy;celled in his re&shy;la&shy;tions with oth&shy;ers. E&shy;ven af&shy;ter long ac&shy;quaint&shy;ance he con&shy;tin&shy;ued to treat them with re&shy;spect.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>5:20</sup>&#8239;Ji Wen Zi al&shy;ways thought three times be&shy;fore act&shy;ing.  Hear&shy;ing this, Confucius said, <q>Twice is e&shy;nough.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>5:23</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, <q>Bo Yi and Shu Qi did not re&shy;mem&shy;ber old griev&shy;ances, so there was lit&shy;tle re&shy;sent&shy;ment a&shy;gainst them.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>5:25</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, <q>Glib talk, an in&shy;gra&shy;ti&shy;at&shy;ing ex&shy;pres&shy;sion, and ob&shy;se&shy;qui&shy;ous con&shy;duct: I am a&shy;shamed of such be&shy;hav&shy;ior.

<p>
    <sup>5:26</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, <q>My heart&#x02BC;s de&shy;sire is to bring peace to the old, to share trust with my friends, and to cher&shy;ish the young.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>5:27</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, <q>I have not yet met any&shy;one who can see his own faults and in&shy;ward&shy;ly ac&shy;cuse him&shy;self.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>6:3</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, <q>Yanhui loved learn&shy;ing. He nev&shy;er took his an&shy;ger out on oth&shy;ers, and nev&shy;er made the same mis&shy;take twice.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>6:11</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, <q>How ad&shy;mi&shy;ra&shy;ble Yanhui was!  He lived on a bowlful of rice to eat, a la&shy;dle&shy;ful of wa&shy;ter to drink, and a hov&shy;el for shel&shy;ter.  Oth&shy;ers could not have en&shy;dured such mis&shy;er&shy;y, yet Yanhui&#x02BC;s joy was un&shy;changed.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>6:12</sup>&#8239;Ran Qiu said, <q>It is not that I don&#x02BC;t en&shy;joy your Way, but I don&#x02BC;t have the strength to fol&shy;low it.</q>  Confucius said, <q>Those who don&#x02BC;t have the strength col&shy;lapse a&shy;long the way, but you have drawn a line be&shy;fore starting.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>6:14</sup>&#8239;Confucius asked Zi You, <q>Have you been a&shy;ble to em&shy;ploy any good peo&shy;ple?</q>  Zi You an&shy;swered, <q>There is Dantai Mieming. He nev&shy;er takes short&shy;cuts, and has nev&shy;er come to my home ex&shy;cept on of&shy;fi&shy;cial busi&shy;ness.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>6:15</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, <q>Meng Zhifan was not boast&shy;ful.  He once held the rear dur&shy;ing a re&shy;treat.  As they reached the cit&shy;y gate, he whipped his horse, say&shy;ing, <q>It&#x02BC;s not that I dared to be last, on&shy;ly that my horse wouldn&#x02BC;t go.</q></q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>6:18</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, <q>When nat&shy;u&shy;ral dis&shy;po&shy;si&shy;tion pre&shy;vails o&shy;ver re&shy;fine&shy;ment, you get a sav&shy;age.  When re&shy;fine&shy;ment pre&shy;vails o&shy;ver nat&shy;u&shy;ral dis&shy;po&shy;si&shy;tion, you get a pe&shy;dan&shy;tic clerk. When nat&shy;u&shy;ral dis&shy;po&shy;si&shy;tion and re&shy;fine&shy;ment are prop&shy;er&shy;ly blend&shy;ed, you get a su&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;or man.</q>
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>7:2</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, <q>It&#x02BC;s nat&shy;u&shy;ral for me to store up knowl&shy;edge si&shy;lent&shy;ly, to learn with&shy;out sa&shy;ti&shy;e&shy;ty, and to teach oth&shy;ers with&shy;out wea&shy;ri&shy;ness.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>7:3</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, <q>My worries are fail&shy;ure to cul&shy;ti&shy;vate vir&shy;tue, fail&shy;ure to ex&shy;plore what I learn, in&shy;a&shy;bil&shy;i&shy;ty to fol&shy;low what is right when I hear it, and in&shy;a&shy;bil&shy;i&shy;ty to change what is not good.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>7:6</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, <q>Set your heart on the Way.  Base your&shy;self in vir&shy;tue. Re&shy;ly on be&shy;nev&shy;o&shy;lence.  En&shy;joy the arts.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>7:7</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, <q>I have nev&shy;er de&shy;nied in&shy;struc&shy;tion to any&shy;one, e&shy;ven if his own re&shy;sources could on&shy;ly af&shy;ford a bun&shy;dle of dried meat for tu&shy;i&shy;tion.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>7:8</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, <q>I on&shy;ly en&shy;light&shy;en those who are driv&shy;en by ea&shy;ger&shy;ness to learn and who are anx&shy;ious&shy;ly try&shy;ing to ex&shy;plain their i&shy;de&shy;as.  If I lift up one cor&shy;ner and they can&shy;not come back with the oth&shy;er three, I don&#x02BC;t re&shy;peat my&shy;self.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>7:9</sup>&#8239;When Confucius was eat&shy;ing in the pres&shy;ence of a mourn&shy;er, he nev&shy;er ate his fill.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>7:11</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, <q>Few have the a&shy;bil&shy;i&shy;ty to act when em&shy;ployed and to hide when dis&shy;missed. If I were com&shy;mand&shy;ing the Three Armies, who would I take with me? A man who would wres&shy;tle a ti&shy;ger with bare hands or cross a riv&shy;er on foot, dy&shy;ing with&shy;out re&shy;gret&mdash;I would not take that man.  It must be some&shy;one who approaches a task with ap&shy;pre&shy;hen&shy;sion, likes to make plans, and can ex&shy;e&shy;cute them suc&shy;cess&shy;ful&shy;ly.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>7:12</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, <q>If wealth can be sought de&shy;cent&shy;ly, I will do so, e&shy;ven if I have to have a low&shy;ly job. If it can&shy;not be sought de&shy;cent&shy;ly, I will fol&shy;low what I love.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>7:15</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, <q>Bo Yi and Shu Qi sought be&shy;nev&shy;o&shy;lence and got it.  Why should they have com&shy;plaints?</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>7:16</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, <q>Coarse rice to eat, wa&shy;ter to drink, and your bent arm for a pil&shy;low&mdash;there is still joy in the midst of these things. Wealth and hon&shy;or ob&shy;tained by un&shy;right&shy;eous means are like fleet&shy;ing clouds to me.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>7:17</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, <q>Give me a few more years; if I can stud&shy;y un&shy;til fif&shy;ty, I may be free from great mis&shy;takes.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>7:19</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, <q>I&#x02BC;m the kind of man who is so ea&shy;ger for knowl&shy;edge that he for&shy;gets to eat, who is so joy&shy;ful that he for&shy;gets to wor&shy;ry, and who is not a&shy;ware that old age is com&shy;ing.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>7:20</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, <q>I was not born with knowl&shy;edge, but I love an&shy;tiq&shy;ui&shy;ty and ear&shy;nest&shy;ly seek it.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>7:21</sup>&#8239;Confucius nev&shy;er dis&shy;cussed strange phe&shy;nom&shy;e&shy;na, feats of strength, dis&shy;or&shy;der, or the spir&shy;its.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>7:22</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, <q>When walk&shy;ing with any two peo&shy;ple, they must have some&shy;thing to teach me. I se&shy;lect their strengths and fol&shy;low them, their weaknesses and cor&shy;rect my&shy;self.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>7:24</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, <q>My friends, I hide noth&shy;ing from you.  What&shy;ev&shy;er I do, I share with you. That is who I am.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>7:25</sup>&#8239;Confucius taught in four categories: lit&shy;er&shy;a&shy;ture, con&shy;duct, loy&shy;al&shy;ty, and faith&shy;ful&shy;ness.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>7:26</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, <q>I can&#x02BC;t hope to meet a sage, but I would be con&shy;tent to meet a su&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;or man.  I can&#x02BC;t hope to meet a tru&shy;ly good man, but I would be con&shy;tent to meet a stead&shy;fast man.  It is hard to be stead&shy;fast when noth&shy;ing pre&shy;tends to be some&shy;thing, emp&shy;ti&shy;ness pre&shy;tends to be full&shy;ness, and pov&shy;er&shy;ty pre&shy;tends to be com&shy;fort.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>7:27</sup>&#8239;Confucius fished with a line, but didn&#x02BC;t use a net.  He hunt&shy;ed, but didn&#x02BC;t shoot roosting birds.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>7:28</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, <q>There may be those who can act with&shy;out knowl&shy;edge, but I am not one of them.  I hear much, se&shy;lect what is good, and fol&shy;low it.  I see much, and re&shy;mem&shy;ber it.  This is the sec&shy;ond lev&shy;el of knowl&shy;edge.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>7:29</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, <q>To ap&shy;prove of a man&#x02BC;s vis&shy;it does not mean ap&shy;prov&shy;ing of what he does af&shy;ter he leaves.  Why be so se&shy;vere?  When a man purifies him&shy;self to ap&shy;proach me, I ap&shy;prove of his pu&shy;ri&shy;ty with&shy;out en&shy;dors&shy;ing his past or his fu&shy;ture.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>7:30</sup>&#8239;The Mas&shy;ter said, &#x02BC;Is vir&shy;tue a thing re&shy;mote? I wish to be vir&shy;tu&shy;ous, and lo! vir&shy;tue is at hand.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>7:31</sup>&#8239;The min&shy;is&shy;ter of crime of Ch&#x02BC;an asked wheth&shy;er the duke Chao knew pro&shy;pri&shy;e&shy;ty, and Confucius said, &#x02BC;He knew pro&shy;pri&shy;e&shy;ty.&#x02BC; Confucius hav&shy;ing re&shy;tired, the min&shy;is&shy;ter bowed to Wu-ma Ch&#x02BC;i to come for&shy;ward, and said, &#x02BC;I have heard that the su&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;or man is not a par&shy;ti&shy;san. May the su&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;or man be a par&shy;ti&shy;san al&shy;so? The prince mar&shy;ried a daugh&shy;ter of the house of Wu, of the same sur&shy;name with him&shy;self, and called her,-- "The eld&shy;er Tsze of Wu." If the prince knew pro&shy;pri&shy;e&shy;ty, who does not know it?&#x02BC; Wu-ma Ch&#x02BC;i re&shy;ported these re&shy;marks, and the Mas&shy;ter said, &#x02BC;I am for&shy;tu&shy;nate! If I have any er&shy;rors, peo&shy;ple are sure to know them.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>7:32</sup>&#8239;When the Mas&shy;ter was in com&shy;pa&shy;ny with a per&shy;son who was sing&shy;ing, if he sang well, he would make him re&shy;peat the song, while he ac&shy;com&shy;pa&shy;nied it with his own voice.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>7:33</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, &#x02BC;In let&shy;ters I am per&shy;haps e&shy;qual to oth&shy;er men, but the char&shy;ac&shy;ter of the su&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;or man, car&shy;ry&shy;ing out in his con&shy;duct what he professes, is what I have not yet at&shy;tained to.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>7:34</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, &#x02BC;The sage and the man of per&shy;fect vir&shy;tue;-- how dare I rank my&shy;self with them? It may simp&shy;ly be said of me, that I strive to be&shy;come such with&shy;out sa&shy;ti&shy;e&shy;ty, and teach oth&shy;ers with&shy;out wea&shy;ri&shy;ness.&#x02BC; Kung-hsi Hwa said, &#x02BC;This is just what we, the dis&shy;ci&shy;ples, can&shy;not im&shy;i&shy;tate you in.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>7:35</sup>&#8239;The Mas&shy;ter be&shy;ing ver&shy;y sick, Tsze-lu asked leave to pray for him. He said, &#x02BC;May such a thing be done?&#x02BC; Tsze-lu replied, &#x02BC;It may. In the Eulogies it is said, "Prayer has been made for thee to the spir&shy;its of the up&shy;per and low&shy;er worlds."&#x02BC; Confucius said, &#x02BC;My praying has been for a long time.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>7:36</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, &#x02BC;Extravagance leads to in&shy;sub&shy;or&shy;di&shy;na&shy;tion, and par&shy;si&shy;mo&shy;ny to meanness. It is bet&shy;ter to be mean than to be in&shy;sub&shy;or&shy;di&shy;nate.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>7:37</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, &#x02BC;The su&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;or man is sat&shy;is&shy;fied and com&shy;posed; the mean man is al&shy;ways full of dis&shy;tress.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>7:38</sup>&#8239;The Mas&shy;ter was mild, and yet dig&shy;ni&shy;fied; ma&shy;jes&shy;tic, and yet not fierce; re&shy;spect&shy;ful, and yet eas&shy;y.
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>8:1</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, &#x02BC;T&#x02BC;ai-po may be said to have reached the highest point of vir&shy;tu&shy;ous ac&shy;tion. Thrice he de&shy;clined the king&shy;dom, and the peo&shy;ple in ig&shy;no&shy;rance of his mo&shy;tives could not ex&shy;press their ap&shy;pro&shy;ba&shy;tion of his con&shy;duct.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>8:2</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, &#x02BC;Respectfulness, with&shy;out the rules of pro&shy;pri&shy;e&shy;ty, be&shy;comes la&shy;bo&shy;ri&shy;ous bus&shy;tle; care&shy;ful&shy;ness, with&shy;out the rules of pro&shy;pri&shy;e&shy;ty, be&shy;comes ti&shy;mid&shy;i&shy;ty; bold&shy;ness, with&shy;out the rules of pro&shy;pri&shy;e&shy;ty, be&shy;comes in&shy;sub&shy;or&shy;di&shy;na&shy;tion; straight&shy;for&shy;ward&shy;ness, with&shy;out the rules of pro&shy;pri&shy;e&shy;ty, be&shy;comes rude&shy;ness.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>8:4</sup>&#8239;The phi&shy;los&shy;o&shy;pher Tsang be&shy;ing ill, Meng Chang went to ask how he was.  Tsang said to him, &#x02BC;When a bird is a&shy;bout to die, its notes are mourn&shy;ful; when a man is a&shy;bout to die, his words are good.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>8:5</sup>&#8239;The phi&shy;los&shy;o&shy;pher Tsang said, &#x02BC;Gifted with a&shy;bil&shy;i&shy;ty, and yet put&shy;ting ques&shy;tions to those who were not so; pos&shy;sessed of much, and yet put&shy;ting ques&shy;tions to those pos&shy;sessed of lit&shy;tle; hav&shy;ing, as though he had not; full, and yet counting him&shy;self as emp&shy;ty;  of&shy;fended a&shy;gainst, and yet entering in&shy;to no al&shy;ter&shy;ca&shy;tion; for&shy;mer&shy;ly I had a friend who pur&shy;sued this style of con&shy;duct.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>8:6</sup>&#8239;The phi&shy;los&shy;o&shy;pher Tsang said, &#x02BC;Suppose that there is an in&shy;di&shy;vid&shy;u&shy;al who can be en&shy;trusted with the charge of a young or&shy;phan prince, and can be com&shy;mis&shy;sioned with au&shy;thor&shy;i&shy;ty o&shy;ver a state of a hun&shy;dred li, and whom no e&shy;mer&shy;gen&shy;cy how&shy;ev&shy;er great can drive from his prin&shy;ci&shy;ples:-- is such a man a su&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;or man? He is a su&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;or man in&shy;deed.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>8:8</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, &#x02BC;It is by the Odes that the mind is a&shy;roused.  &#x02BC;It is by the Rules of Pro&shy;pri&shy;e&shy;ty that the char&shy;ac&shy;ter is es&shy;tab&shy;lished. &#x02BC;It is from Mu&shy;sic that the fin&shy;ish is re&shy;ceived.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>8:9</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, &#x02BC;The peo&shy;ple may be made to fol&shy;low a path of ac&shy;tion, but they may not be made to un&shy;der&shy;stand it.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>8:10</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, &#x02BC;The man who is fond of dar&shy;ing and is dis&shy;sat&shy;is&shy;fied with pov&shy;er&shy;ty, will pro&shy;ceed to in&shy;sub&shy;or&shy;di&shy;na&shy;tion. So will the man who is not vir&shy;tu&shy;ous, when you car&shy;ry your dis&shy;like of him to an ex&shy;treme.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>8:11</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, &#x02BC;Though a man have abilities as ad&shy;mi&shy;ra&shy;ble as those of the Duke of Chau, yet if he be proud and nig&shy;gard&shy;ly, those oth&shy;er things are re&shy;al&shy;ly not worth be&shy;ing looked at.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>8:13</sup>&#8239;&#x02BC;When a coun&shy;try is well-governed, pov&shy;er&shy;ty and a mean con&shy;di&shy;tion are things to be a&shy;shamed of. When a coun&shy;try is ill-governed, rich&shy;es and honour are things to be a&shy;shamed of.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>8:14</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, &#x02BC;He who is not in any par&shy;tic&shy;u&shy;lar of&shy;fice, has noth&shy;ing to do with plans for the ad&shy;min&shy;is&shy;tra&shy;tion of its duties.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>8:16</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, &#x02BC;Ardent and yet not up&shy;right; stu&shy;pid and yet not at&shy;ten&shy;tive; sim&shy;ple and yet not sin&shy;cere:-- such per&shy;sons I do not un&shy;der&shy;stand.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>8:21</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, &#x02BC;I can find no flaw in the char&shy;ac&shy;ter of Yu. He used him&shy;self coarse food and drink, but dis&shy;played the ut&shy;most fil&shy;ial pi&shy;e&shy;ty to&shy;wards the spir&shy;its. His or&shy;di&shy;nar&shy;y gar&shy;ments were poor, but he dis&shy;played the ut&shy;most el&shy;e&shy;gance in his sac&shy;ri&shy;fi&shy;cial cap and a&shy;pron. He lived in a low mean house, but ex&shy;pended all his strength on the ditches and wa&shy;ter-channels. I can find noth&shy;ing like a flaw in Yu.&#x02BC;

    <sup>9:1</sup>&#8239;The sub&shy;jects of which the Mas&shy;ter sel&shy;dom spoke were-- prof&shy;it&shy;a&shy;ble&shy;ness, and al&shy;so the ap&shy;point&shy;ments of Heav&shy;en, and per&shy;fect vir&shy;tue.
</p>

    <sup>9:3</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, &#x02BC;The lin&shy;en cap is that pre&shy;scribed by the rules of cer&shy;e&shy;mo&shy;ny, but now a silk one is worn. It is e&shy;co&shy;nom&shy;i&shy;cal, and I fol&shy;low the com&shy;mon prac&shy;tice.  &#x02BC;The rules of cer&shy;e&shy;mo&shy;ny pre&shy;scribe the bow&shy;ing be&shy;low the hall, but now the prac&shy;tice is to bow on&shy;ly af&shy;ter as&shy;cend&shy;ing it.

    <sup>9:4</sup>&#8239;There were four things from which the Mas&shy;ter was en&shy;tire&shy;ly free. He had no fore&shy;gone con&shy;clu&shy;sions, no ar&shy;bi&shy;trar&shy;y pre&shy;de&shy;ter&shy;mi&shy;na&shy;tions, no ob&shy;sti&shy;na&shy;cy, and no e&shy;go&shy;ism.

    <sup>9:5</sup>&#8239;The Mas&shy;ter was put in fear in K&#x02BC;wang.  He said, &#x02BC;After the death of King Wan, was not the cause of truth lodged here in me?  &#x02BC;If Heav&shy;en had wished to let this cause of truth per&shy;ish, then I, a fu&shy;ture mor&shy;tal, should not have got such a re&shy;la&shy;tion to that cause.

    <sup>9:6</sup>&#8239;A high of&shy;fic&shy;er asked Tsze-kung, say&shy;ing, &#x02BC;May we not say that your Mas&shy;ter is a sage? How var&shy;i&shy;ous is his a&shy;bil&shy;i&shy;ty!&#x02BC; Tsze-kung said, &#x02BC;Certainly Heav&shy;en has en&shy;dowed him un&shy;lim&shy;it&shy;ed&shy;ly. He is a&shy;bout a sage. And, more&shy;o&shy;ver, his a&shy;bil&shy;i&shy;ty is var&shy;i&shy;ous.&#x02BC; The Mas&shy;ter heard of the con&shy;ver&shy;sa&shy;tion and said, &#x02BC;Does the high of&shy;fic&shy;er know me? When I was young, my con&shy;di&shy;tion was low, and there&shy;fore I ac&shy;quired my a&shy;bil&shy;i&shy;ty in man&shy;y things, but they were mean mat&shy;ters. Must the su&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;or man have such va&shy;ri&shy;e&shy;ty of a&shy;bil&shy;i&shy;ty?  He does not need va&shy;ri&shy;e&shy;ty of a&shy;bil&shy;i&shy;ty.&#x02BC; Lao said, &#x02BC;Confucius said, "Having no of&shy;fi&shy;cial em&shy;ploy&shy;ment, I ac&shy;quired man&shy;y arts."&#x02BC;

<p>
    <sup>9:7</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, &#x02BC;Am I in&shy;deed pos&shy;sessed of knowl&shy;edge? I am not know&shy;ing. But if a mean per&shy;son, who ap&shy;pears quite emp&shy;ty-like, ask any&shy;thing of me, I set it forth from one end to the oth&shy;er, and ex&shy;haust it.&#x02BC;

    <sup>9:12</sup>&#8239;Tsze-kung said, &#x02BC;There is a beau&shy;ti&shy;ful gem here.  Should I lay it up in a case and keep it? or should I seek for a good price and sell it?&#x02BC; Confucius said, &#x02BC;Sell it! Sell it! But I would wait for one to of&shy;fer the price.&#x02BC;

    <sup>9:13</sup>&#8239;The Mas&shy;ter was wishing to go and live a&shy;mong the nine wild tribes of the east.  Some one said, &#x02BC;They are rude.

</p>

<p>
    <sup>9:15</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, &#x02BC;Abroad, to serve the high min&shy;is&shy;ters and no&shy;bles; at home, to serve one&#x02BC;s fa&shy;ther and eld&shy;er broth&shy;ers; in all duties to the dead, not to dare not to ex&shy;ert one&#x02BC;s self;  and not to be o&shy;ver&shy;come of wine:-- which one of these things do I at&shy;tain to?&#x02BC;

<p>
    <sup>9:18</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, &#x02BC;The pros&shy;e&shy;cu&shy;tion of learn&shy;ing may be com&shy;pared to what may hap&shy;pen in rais&shy;ing a mound. If there want but one bas&shy;ket of earth to com&shy;plete the work, and I stop, the stop&shy;ping is my own work. It may be com&shy;pared to throwing down the earth on the lev&shy;el ground. Though but one bas&shy;ket&shy;ful is thrown at a time, the ad&shy;vanc&shy;ing with it is my own go&shy;ing for&shy;ward.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>9:21</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, &#x02BC;There are cases in which the blade springs, but the plant does not go on to flow&shy;er! There are cases where it flow&shy;ers, but no fruit is sub&shy;se&shy;quent&shy;ly pro&shy;duced!&#x02BC;

<p>
    <sup>9:22</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, &#x02BC;A youth is to be re&shy;garded with re&shy;spect. How do we know that his fu&shy;ture will not be e&shy;qual to our pres&shy;ent? If he reach the age of for&shy;ty or fif&shy;ty, and has not made him&shy;self heard of, then in&shy;deed he will not be worth be&shy;ing re&shy;garded with re&shy;spect.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>9:23</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, &#x02BC;Can men ref&shy;use to as&shy;sent to the words of strict ad&shy;mo&shy;ni&shy;tion? But it is reforming the con&shy;duct be&shy;cause of them which is val&shy;u&shy;a&shy;ble. Can men ref&shy;use to be pleased with words of gen&shy;tle ad&shy;vice? But it is unfolding their aim which is val&shy;u&shy;a&shy;ble. If a man be pleased with these words, but does not un&shy;fold their aim, and as&shy;sents to those, but does not re&shy;form his con&shy;duct, I can re&shy;al&shy;ly do noth&shy;ing with him.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>9:24</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, &#x02BC;Hold faith&shy;ful&shy;ness and sin&shy;cer&shy;i&shy;ty as first prin&shy;ci&shy;ples. Have no friends not e&shy;qual to your&shy;self. When you have faults, do not fear to a&shy;ban&shy;don them.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>9:25</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, &#x02BC;The com&shy;mand&shy;er of the forces of a large state may be car&shy;ried off, but the will of e&shy;ven a com&shy;mon man can&shy;not be tak&shy;en from him.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>9:26</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, &#x02BC;Dressed him&shy;self in a tat&shy;tered robe quilt&shy;ed with hemp, yet stand&shy;ing by the side of men dressed in furs, and not a&shy;shamed;-- ah! it is Yu who is e&shy;qual to this!  &#x02BC;"He dis&shy;likes none, he cov&shy;ets noth&shy;ing;-- what can he do but what is good!"&#x02BC; Tsze-lu kept con&shy;tin&shy;u&shy;al&shy;ly repeating these words of the ode, when the Mas&shy;ter said, &#x02BC;Those things are by no means suf&shy;fi&shy;cient to con&shy;sti&shy;tute (perfect) ex&shy;cel&shy;lence.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>9:28</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, &#x02BC;The wise are free from perplexities; the vir&shy;tu&shy;ous from anx&shy;i&shy;e&shy;ty; and the bold from fear.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>9:29</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, &#x02BC;There are some with whom we may stud&shy;y in com&shy;mon, but we shall find them un&shy;a&shy;ble to go a&shy;long with us to prin&shy;ci&shy;ples. Per&shy;haps we may go on with them to prin&shy;ci&shy;ples, but we shall find them un&shy;a&shy;ble to get es&shy;tab&shy;lished in those a&shy;long with us.

<p>
    <sup>10:1</sup>&#8239;Confucius, in his vil&shy;lage, looked sim&shy;ple and sin&shy;cere, and as if he were not a&shy;ble to speak.  When he was in the prince&#x02BC;s ancestorial tem&shy;ple, or in the court, he spoke min&shy;ute&shy;ly on eve&shy;ry point, but cau&shy;tious&shy;ly.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>10:2</sup>&#8239;When he was waiting at court, in speak&shy;ing with the great of&shy;fic&shy;ers of the low&shy;er grade, he spake free&shy;ly, but in a straight&shy;for&shy;ward man&shy;ner; in speak&shy;ing with those of the higher grade, he did so bland&shy;ly, but pre&shy;cise&shy;ly.  When the rul&shy;er was pres&shy;ent, his man&shy;ner dis&shy;played re&shy;spect&shy;ful un&shy;eas&shy;i&shy;ness; it was gra&shy;ve, but self-possessed.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>10:6</sup>&#8239;The su&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;or man did not use a deep pur&shy;ple, or a puce colour, in the or&shy;na&shy;ments of his dress.  E&shy;ven in his un&shy;dress, he did not wear any&shy;thing of a red or red&shy;dish colour.  In warm weath&shy;er, he had a sin&shy;gle gar&shy;ment ei&shy;ther of coarse or fi&shy;ne tex&shy;ture, but he wore it dis&shy;played o&shy;ver an in&shy;ner gar&shy;ment.  O&shy;ver lamb&#x02BC;s fur he wore a gar&shy;ment of black; o&shy;ver fawn&#x02BC;s fur one of white; and o&shy;ver fox&#x02BC;s fur one of yel&shy;low.  The fur robe of his un&shy;dress was long, with the right sleeve short.  He re&shy;quired his sleep&shy;ing dress to be half as long a&shy;gain as his bod&shy;y.  When stay&shy;ing at home, he used thick furs of the fox or the badg&shy;er.  When he put off mourn&shy;ing, he wore all the ap&shy;pend&shy;ages of the gir&shy;dle.  His un&shy;der-garment, ex&shy;cept when it was re&shy;quired to be of the cur&shy;tain shape, was made of silk cut nar&shy;row a&shy;bove and wide be&shy;low.  He did not wear lamb&#x02BC;s fur or a black cap, on a vis&shy;it of con&shy;do&shy;lence.  On the first day of the month he put on his court robes, and pre&shy;sented him&shy;self at court.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>10:7</sup>&#8239;When fasting, he thought it nec&shy;es&shy;sar&shy;y to have his clothes bright&shy;ly clean and made of lin&shy;en cloth.  When fasting, he thought it nec&shy;es&shy;sar&shy;y to change his food, and al&shy;so to change the place where he com&shy;mon&shy;ly sat in the a&shy;part&shy;ment.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>10:8</sup>&#8239;He did not dis&shy;like to have his rice fine&shy;ly cleaned, nor to have his minced meat cut quite small.  He did not eat rice which had been in&shy;jured by heat or damp and turned sour, nor fish or flesh which was gone. He did not eat what was discoloured, or what was of a bad fla&shy;vour, nor any&shy;thing which was ill-cooked, or was not in sea&shy;son.  He did not eat meat which was not cut prop&shy;er&shy;ly, nor what was served with&shy;out its prop&shy;er sauce.  Though there might be a large quan&shy;ti&shy;ty of meat, he would not al&shy;low what he took to ex&shy;ceed the due pro&shy;por&shy;tion for the rice. It was on&shy;ly in wine that he laid down no lim&shy;it for him&shy;self, but he did not al&shy;low him&shy;self to be con&shy;fused by it.  He did not par&shy;take of wine and dried meat bought in the mar&shy;ket.  He was nev&shy;er with&shy;out gin&shy;ger when he ate.  He did not eat much.  When he had been assisting at the prince&#x02BC;s sac&shy;ri&shy;fice, he did not keep the flesh which he re&shy;ceived o&shy;ver&shy;night. The flesh of his fam&shy;i&shy;ly sac&shy;ri&shy;fice he did not keep o&shy;ver three days. If kept o&shy;ver three days, peo&shy;ple could not eat it. When eat&shy;ing, he did not con&shy;verse. When in bed, he did not speak. Al&shy;though his food might be coarse rice and veg&shy;e&shy;ta&shy;ble soup, he would of&shy;fer a lit&shy;tle of it in sac&shy;ri&shy;fice with a gra&shy;ve, re&shy;spect&shy;ful air.

</p>

<p>
    <sup>10:13</sup>&#8239;When the prince sent him a gift of cooked meat, he would ad&shy;just his mat, first taste it, and then give it a&shy;way to oth&shy;ers. When the prince sent him a gift of un&shy;dressed meat, he would have it cooked, and of&shy;fer it to the spir&shy;its of his an&shy;ces&shy;tors.  When the prince sent him a gift of a liv&shy;ing an&shy;i&shy;mal, he would keep it a&shy;live.  When he was in at&shy;tend&shy;ance on the prince and joining in the en&shy;ter&shy;tain&shy;ment, the prince on&shy;ly sacrificed. He first tast&shy;ed eve&shy;ry&shy;thing.  When he was ill and the prince came to vis&shy;it him, he had his head to the east, made his court robes be spread o&shy;ver him, and drew his gir&shy;dle a&shy;cross them.  When the prince&#x02BC;s or&shy;der called him, with&shy;out waiting for his car&shy;riage to be yoked, he went at once.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>10:14</sup>&#8239;When he en&shy;tered the an&shy;ces&shy;tral tem&shy;ple of the State, he asked a&shy;bout eve&shy;ry&shy;thing.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>10:15</sup>&#8239;When any of his friends died, if he had no re&shy;la&shy;tions who could be de&shy;pended on for the nec&shy;es&shy;sar&shy;y of&shy;fices, he would say, &#x02BC;I will bur&shy;y him.&#x02BC; When a friend sent him a pres&shy;ent, though it might be a car&shy;riage and hors&shy;es, he did not bow.  The on&shy;ly pres&shy;ent for which he bowed was that of the flesh of sac&shy;ri&shy;fice.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>10:17</sup>&#8239;When he was a&shy;bout to mount his car&shy;riage, he would stand straight, hold&shy;ing the cord.  When he was in the car&shy;riage, he did not turn his head quite round, he did not talk hast&shy;i&shy;ly, he did not point with his hands.

    <sup>14:1</sup>&#8239;Hsien asked what was shame&shy;ful.

    <sup>14:5</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, &#x02BC;The vir&shy;tu&shy;ous will be sure to speak cor&shy;rect&shy;ly, but those whose speech is good may not al&shy;ways be vir&shy;tu&shy;ous. Men of prin&shy;ci&shy;ple are sure to be bold, but those who are bold may not al&shy;ways be men of prin&shy;ci&shy;ple.&#x02BC;

    <sup>14:7</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, &#x02BC;Superior men, and yet not al&shy;ways vir&shy;tu&shy;ous, there have been, a&shy;las! But there nev&shy;er has been a mean man, and, at the same time, vir&shy;tu&shy;ous.&#x02BC;

<p>
    <sup>14:8</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, &#x02BC;Can there be love which does not lead to strictness with its ob&shy;ject? Can there be loy&shy;al&shy;ty which does not lead to the in&shy;struc&shy;tion of its ob&shy;ject?&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>14:11</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, &#x02BC;To be poor with&shy;out murmuring is dif&shy;fi&shy;cult. To be rich with&shy;out be&shy;ing proud is eas&shy;y.&#x02BC;

<p>
    <sup>14:13</sup>&#8239;Tsze-lu asked what con&shy;sti&shy;tut&shy;ed a COMPLETE man.

The man, who in the view of gain, thinks of right&shy;eous&shy;ness; who in the view of dan&shy;ger is pre&shy;pared to give up his life; and who does not for&shy;get an old a&shy;gree&shy;ment how&shy;ev&shy;er far back it ex&shy;tends:-- such a man may be reck&shy;oned a COMPLETE man.&#x02BC;

He laughs when there is oc&shy;ca&shy;sion to be joy&shy;ful, and so men do not get tired of his laugh&shy;ing. He takes when it is con&shy;sist&shy;ent with right&shy;eous&shy;ness to do so, and so men do not get tired of his tak&shy;ing.&#x02BC; Confucius said, &#x02BC;So! But is it so with him?&#x02BC;

<p>
    <sup>14:21</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, &#x02BC;He who speaks with&shy;out mod&shy;es&shy;ty will find it dif&shy;fi&shy;cult to make his words good.&#x02BC;

    <sup>14:23</sup>&#8239;Tsze-lu asked how a rul&shy;er should be served. Confucius said, &#x02BC;Do not im&shy;pose on him, and, more&shy;o&shy;ver, with&shy;stand him to his face.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>14:24</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, &#x02BC;The prog&shy;ress of the su&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;or man is up&shy;wards; the prog&shy;ress of the mean man is down&shy;wards.&#x02BC;

</p>

<p>
    <sup>14:27</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, &#x02BC;He who is not in any par&shy;tic&shy;u&shy;lar of&shy;fice, has noth&shy;ing to do with plans for the ad&shy;min&shy;is&shy;tra&shy;tion of its duties.&#x02BC;

<p>
    <sup>14:29</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, &#x02BC;The su&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;or man is mod&shy;est in his speech, but ex&shy;ceeds in his ac&shy;tions.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>14:30</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, &#x02BC;The way of the su&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;or man is three&shy;fold, but I am not e&shy;qual to it. Vir&shy;tu&shy;ous, he is free from anxieties; wise, he is free from perplexities; bold, he is free from fear. Tsze-kung said, &#x02BC;Master, that is what you your&shy;self say.&#x02BC;

<p>
    <sup>14:31</sup>&#8239;Tsze-kung was in the hab&shy;it of com&shy;par&shy;ing men to&shy;geth&shy;er. The Mas&shy;ter said, &#x02BC;Tsze must have reached a high pitch of ex&shy;cel&shy;lence! Now, I have not lei&shy;sure for this.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>14:32</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, &#x02BC;I will not be con&shy;cerned at men&#x02BC;s not know&shy;ing me; I will be con&shy;cerned at my own want of a&shy;bil&shy;i&shy;ty.&#x02BC;

<p>
    <sup>14:33</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, &#x02BC;He who does not an&shy;tic&shy;i&shy;pate at&shy;tempts to de&shy;ceive him, nor think be&shy;fore&shy;hand of his not be&shy;ing be&shy;lieved, and yet ap&shy;pre&shy;hends these things read&shy;i&shy;ly (when they oc&shy;cur);-- is he not a man of su&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;or worth?&#x02BC;

<p>
    <sup>14:35</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, &#x02BC;A horse is called a ch&#x02BC;i, not be&shy;cause of its strength, but be&shy;cause of its oth&shy;er good qualities.&#x02BC;

    <sup>14:37</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, &#x02BC;Alas! there is no one that knows me.&#x02BC; Tsze-kung said, &#x02BC;What do you mean by thus say&shy;ing-- that no one knows you?&#x02BC; The Mas&shy;ter replied, &#x02BC;I do not mur&shy;mur a&shy;gainst Heav&shy;en. I do not grum&shy;ble a&shy;gainst men. My stud&shy;ies lie low, and my pen&shy;e&shy;tra&shy;tion rises high. But there is Heav&shy;en;-- that knows me!&#x02BC;

    <sup>14:39</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, &#x02BC;Some men of worth re&shy;tire from the world.  Some re&shy;tire from par&shy;tic&shy;u&shy;lar states.

"Deep wa&shy;ter must be crossed with the clothes on;  shal&shy;low wa&shy;ter may be crossed with the clothes held up."&#x02BC; Confucius said, &#x02BC;How de&shy;ter&shy;mined is he in his pur&shy;pose!

    <sup>15:7</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, &#x02BC;When a man may be spo&shy;ken with, not to speak to him is to err in ref&shy;er&shy;ence to the man.

    <sup>15:18</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, &#x02BC;The su&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;or man is dis&shy;tressed by his want of a&shy;bil&shy;i&shy;ty. He is not dis&shy;tressed by men&#x02BC;s not know&shy;ing him.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>15:19</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, &#x02BC;The su&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;or man dis&shy;likes the thought of his name not be&shy;ing men&shy;tioned af&shy;ter his death.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>15:20</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, &#x02BC;What the su&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;or man seeks, is in him&shy;self. What the mean man seeks, is in oth&shy;ers.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>15:21</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, &#x02BC;The su&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;or man is dig&shy;ni&shy;fied, but does not wran&shy;gle. He is so&shy;cia&shy;ble, but not a par&shy;ti&shy;zan.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>15:22</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, &#x02BC;The su&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;or man does not pro&shy;mote a man simp&shy;ly on ac&shy;count of his words, nor does he put a&shy;side good words be&shy;cause of the man.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>15:23</sup>&#8239;Tsze-kung asked, say&shy;ing, &#x02BC;Is there one word which may serve as a rule of prac&shy;tice for all one&#x02BC;s life?&#x02BC; Confucius said, &#x02BC;Is not RECIPROCITY such a word? What you do not want done to your&shy;self, do not do to oth&shy;ers.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>15:25</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, &#x02BC;Even in my ear&shy;ly days, a his&shy;to&shy;ri&shy;og&shy;ra&shy;pher would leave a blank in his text, and he who had a horse would lend him to an&shy;oth&shy;er to ride. Now, a&shy;las! there are no such things.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>15:26</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, &#x02BC;Specious words con&shy;found vir&shy;tue. Want of for&shy;bear&shy;ance in small mat&shy;ters con&shy;founds great plans.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>15:27</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, &#x02BC;When the mul&shy;ti&shy;tude hate a man, it is nec&shy;es&shy;sar&shy;y to ex&shy;am&shy;ine in&shy;to the case. When the mul&shy;ti&shy;tude like a man, it is nec&shy;es&shy;sar&shy;y to ex&shy;am&shy;ine in&shy;to the case.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>15:28</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, &#x02BC;A man can en&shy;large the prin&shy;ci&shy;ples which he fol&shy;lows; those prin&shy;ci&shy;ples do not en&shy;large the man.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>15:29</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, &#x02BC;To have faults and not to re&shy;form them,-- this, in&shy;deed, should be pro&shy;nounced hav&shy;ing faults.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>15:30</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, &#x02BC;I have been the whole day with&shy;out eat&shy;ing, and the whole night with&shy;out sleep&shy;ing:-- occupied with think&shy;ing. It was of no use. The bet&shy;ter plan is to learn.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>15:31</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, &#x02BC;The ob&shy;ject of the su&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;or man is truth. Food is not his ob&shy;ject. There is plowing;-- e&shy;ven in that there is some&shy;times want. So with learn&shy;ing;-- e&shy;mol&shy;u&shy;ment may be found in it. The su&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;or man is anx&shy;ious lest he should not get truth; he is not anx&shy;ious lest pov&shy;er&shy;ty should come up&shy;on him.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>15:32</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, &#x02BC;When a man&#x02BC;s knowl&shy;edge is suf&shy;fi&shy;cient to at&shy;tain, and his vir&shy;tue is not suf&shy;fi&shy;cient to en&shy;a&shy;ble him to hold, what&shy;ev&shy;er he may have gained, he will lose a&shy;gain.  &#x02BC;When his knowl&shy;edge is suf&shy;fi&shy;cient to at&shy;tain, and he has vir&shy;tue e&shy;nough to hold fast, if he can&shy;not gov&shy;ern with dig&shy;ni&shy;ty, the peo&shy;ple will not re&shy;spect him.  &#x02BC;When his knowl&shy;edge is suf&shy;fi&shy;cient to at&shy;tain, and he has vir&shy;tue e&shy;nough to hold fast; when he gov&shy;erns al&shy;so with dig&shy;ni&shy;ty, yet if he try to move the peo&shy;ple con&shy;tra&shy;ry to the rules of pro&shy;pri&shy;e&shy;ty:-- full ex&shy;cel&shy;lence is not reached.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>15:33</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, &#x02BC;The su&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;or man can&shy;not be known in lit&shy;tle mat&shy;ters; but he may be in&shy;trusted with great con&shy;cerns. The small man may not be in&shy;trusted with great con&shy;cerns, but he may be known in lit&shy;tle mat&shy;ters.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>15:35</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, &#x02BC;Let eve&shy;ry man con&shy;sid&shy;er vir&shy;tue as what de&shy;volves on him&shy;self. He may not yield the per&shy;for&shy;mance of it e&shy;ven to his teach&shy;er.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>15:36</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, &#x02BC;The su&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;or man is cor&shy;rect&shy;ly firm, and not firm mere&shy;ly.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>15:37</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, &#x02BC;A min&shy;is&shy;ter, in serv&shy;ing his prince, reverently dis&shy;charges his duties, and makes his e&shy;mol&shy;u&shy;ment a sec&shy;ond&shy;ar&shy;y con&shy;sid&shy;er&shy;a&shy;tion.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>15:38</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, &#x02BC;In teach&shy;ing there should be no dis&shy;tinc&shy;tion of clas&shy;ses.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>15:39</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, &#x02BC;Those whose cours&shy;es are dif&shy;fer&shy;ent can&shy;not lay plans for one an&shy;oth&shy;er.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>15:40</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, &#x02BC;In lan&shy;guage it is simp&shy;ly re&shy;quired that it con&shy;vey the mean&shy;ing.&#x02BC;
