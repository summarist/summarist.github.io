    <sup>1:1</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, <q>Isn&#x02BC;t it a pleas&shy;ure to learn some&shy;thing, then to ap&shy;ply it at the right time?  Isn&#x02BC;t it a joy to have friends come from a&shy;far?  Isn&#x02BC;t he a su&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;or man who takes no of&shy;fense when his mer&shy;its are ig&shy;nored?</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>1:2</sup>&#8239;Mas&shy;ter You said, <q>The su&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;or man works on the root, for once the root is es&shy;tab&shy;lished, the <em class="italic">way</em> will grow from it.  Isn&#x02BC;t re&shy;spect for par&shy;ents and el&shy;ders the root of <em class="italic">benevolence</em>?</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>1:3</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, <q>Cun&shy;ning words and an in&shy;gra&shy;ti&shy;at&shy;ing ap&shy;pear&shy;ance rare&shy;ly ac&shy;com&shy;pa&shy;ny <em class="italic">benevolence</em>.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>1:4</sup>&#8239;Mas&shy;ter Zeng said, <q>Each day I ex&shy;am&shy;ine my&shy;self on three points. When deal&shy;ing on be&shy;half of oth&shy;ers, have I been loy&shy;al?  In my in&shy;ter&shy;ac&shy;tions with friends, have I been trust&shy;wor&shy;thy?  Have I prac&shy;tised what I was taught?</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>1:5</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, <q>The <em class="italic">way</em> to guide a state of a thou&shy;sand char&shy;i&shy;ots: be at&shy;ten&shy;tive to busi&shy;ness and trust&shy;wor&shy;thy; be fru&shy;gal in ex&shy;pend&shy;i&shy;tures and love your fel&shy;low men; on&shy;ly mo&shy;bi&shy;lize the com&shy;mon peo&shy;ple at the prop&shy;er time of year.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>1:6</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, <q>A young man should re&shy;spect his par&shy;ents at home, re&shy;spect his el&shy;ders a&shy;broad, say lit&shy;tle but be trust&shy;wor&shy;thy, love the peo&shy;ple at large but be in&shy;ti&shy;mate with <em class="italic">the be&shy;nev&shy;o&shy;lent</em>. If he still has en&shy;er&shy;gy to spare, let him stud&shy;y <em class="italic">literature</em>.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>1:7</sup>&#8239;Zixia said, <q>Oth&shy;ers may say that a man is un&shy;ed&shy;u&shy;cat&shy;ed, but I call him ed&shy;u&shy;cat&shy;ed if he val&shy;ues vir&shy;tue more than beau&shy;ty, ex&shy;erts his ut&shy;most when serv&shy;ing his par&shy;ents, of&shy;fers his whole per&shy;son when serv&shy;ing his lord, and is trust&shy;wor&shy;thy when speak&shy;ing with friends.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>1:10</sup>&#8239;Ziqin asked Zigong, <q>When our Mas&shy;ter ar&shy;rives in a coun&shy;try, he al&shy;ways learns a&shy;bout its gov&shy;ern&shy;ment.  Does he seek out this in&shy;for&shy;ma&shy;tion or is it giv&shy;en to him?</q>  Zigong replied, <q>Our Mas&shy;ter ob&shy;tains it by be&shy;ing cor&shy;dial, up&shy;right, re&shy;spect&shy;ful, fru&shy;gal, and def&shy;er&shy;en&shy;tial. Our Mas&shy;ter seeks it dif&shy;fer&shy;ent&shy;ly than oth&shy;er men do.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>1:14</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, <q>A su&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;or man seeks nei&shy;ther a full stom&shy;ach nor com&shy;fort&shy;a&shy;ble lodg&shy;ings.  He is dil&shy;i&shy;gent in his ac&shy;tions but cau&shy;tious in his speech.  He as&shy;so&shy;ci&shy;ates with those who know the <em class="italic">way</em> in or&shy;der to be put right.  Such a man may be said to love learn&shy;ing.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>1:15</sup>&#8239;Zigong asked, <q>What do you think of the say&shy;ing, <q>Poor with&shy;out grov&shy;el&shy;ing, rich with&shy;out ar&shy;ro&shy;gance</q>?</q> The Mas&shy;ter replied, <q>Not bad, but bet&shy;ter still, <q>Poor but enjoying the <em class="italic">way</em>, rich but lov&shy;ing <em class="italic">propriety</em>.</q></q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>1:16</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, <q>Don&#x02BC;t wor&shy;ry that men don&#x02BC;t rec&shy;og&shy;nize your mer&shy;its; wor&shy;ry that you don&#x02BC;t rec&shy;og&shy;nize theirs.</q>
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>2:1</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, <q>He who gov&shy;erns by vir&shy;tue is like the North Star: it stays in its place while all the oth&shy;er stars pay hom&shy;age to it.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:3</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, <q>Lead the peo&shy;ple with e&shy;dicts, keep them or&shy;der&shy;ly with pun&shy;ish&shy;ments: they will e&shy;vade the pun&shy;ish&shy;ment and have no sense of shame.  Lead them with vir&shy;tue, keep them or&shy;der&shy;ly with <em class="italic">propriety</em>: they will have a sense of shame and or&shy;der them&shy;selves.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:6</sup>&#8239;Meng Wubo asked a&shy;bout <em class="italic">filial pi&shy;e&shy;ty</em>. Confucius said, <q>Give your par&shy;ents noth&shy;ing to wor&shy;ry a&shy;bout oth&shy;er than ill&shy;ness.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:7</sup>&#8239;Ziyou asked a&shy;bout <em class="italic">filial pi&shy;e&shy;ty</em>. Confucius said, <q>Now&shy;a&shy;days <em class="italic">filial pi&shy;e&shy;ty</em> on&shy;ly means be&shy;ing a&shy;ble to feed your par&shy;ents.  But e&shy;ven dogs and hors&shy;es re&shy;ceive this much care.  With&shy;out re&shy;spect, what&#x02BC;s the dif&shy;fer&shy;ence?</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:8</sup>&#8239;Zixia asked a&shy;bout <em class="italic">filial pi&shy;e&shy;ty</em>. Confucius said, <q>It&#x02BC;s the ex&shy;pres&shy;sion on your face that&#x02BC;s dif&shy;fi&shy;cult to man&shy;age.  It&#x02BC;s not <em class="italic">filial pi&shy;e&shy;ty</em> mere&shy;ly for the young to shoul&shy;der the bur&shy;den when there is work to do, and to de&shy;fer to their el&shy;ders when there is wine and food a&shy;vail&shy;a&shy;ble.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:10</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, <q>Look at the means a man em&shy;ploys.  Ob&shy;serve his mo&shy;tives. Ex&shy;am&shy;ine what gives him com&shy;fort.  How can a man con&shy;ceal his char&shy;ac&shy;ter?</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:11</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, <q>If a man learns the new by reviewing the old, he is wor&shy;thy to be a teach&shy;er.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:13</sup>&#8239;Zigong asked a&shy;bout the su&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;or man. Confucius said, <q>He acts be&shy;fore he speaks, and then speaks ac&shy;cord&shy;ing to his ac&shy;tions.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:14</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, <q>The su&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;or man is in&shy;clu&shy;sive and not par&shy;ti&shy;san.  The in&shy;fe&shy;ri&shy;or man is par&shy;ti&shy;san and not in&shy;clu&shy;sive.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:15</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, <q>Learn&shy;ing with&shy;out think&shy;ing is a waste.  Think&shy;ing with&shy;out learn&shy;ing is dan&shy;ger&shy;ous.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:17</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, <q>Knowl&shy;edge is to know when you know some&shy;thing, and to know when you don&#x02BC;t.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:18</sup>&#8239;Zizhang was stud&shy;y&shy;ing in or&shy;der to get an of&shy;fi&shy;cial po&shy;si&shy;tion. Confucius said, <q>If you lis&shy;ten much, put a&shy;side what is doubt&shy;ful, and speak cau&shy;tious&shy;ly a&shy;bout the rest, you will make few mis&shy;takes.  If you ob&shy;serve much, put a&shy;side what is per&shy;i&shy;lous, and act cau&shy;tious&shy;ly on the rest, you will have few re&shy;grets.  Few mis&shy;takes in speech, few re&shy;grets in ac&shy;tion: an of&shy;fi&shy;cial po&shy;si&shy;tion will fol&shy;low.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:19</sup>&#8239;Duke A&shy;i asked, <q>What should I do so that the peo&shy;ple fol&shy;low me?</q> Confucius said, <q>If you raise up the straight and place them o&shy;ver the crook&shy;ed, the peo&shy;ple will fol&shy;low you.  If you raise up the crook&shy;ed and place them o&shy;ver the straight, the peo&shy;ple will not fol&shy;low you.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:20</sup>&#8239;Ji Kangzi asked, <q>How can I en&shy;cour&shy;age the peo&shy;ple to be re&shy;spect&shy;ful, loy&shy;al, and dil&shy;i&shy;gent?</q>  Confucius said, <q>Ap&shy;proach them with dig&shy;ni&shy;ty then they will be re&shy;spect&shy;ful.  Be <em class="italic">filial</em> and kind then they will be loy&shy;al.  Raise up the good and in&shy;struct the in&shy;com&shy;pe&shy;tent then they will be dil&shy;i&shy;gent.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:21</sup>&#8239;Some&shy;one asked Confucius, <q>Why don&#x02BC;t you en&shy;gage in gov&shy;ern&shy;ment?</q> Confucius said, <q>The Book of Doc&shy;u&shy;ments says, <q>Just by be&shy;ing <em class="italic">filial</em> and be&shy;ing friend&shy;ly to your broth&shy;ers you will have an ef&shy;fect on gov&shy;ern&shy;ment.</q>  Since this is al&shy;so en&shy;gag&shy;ing in gov&shy;ern&shy;ment, why do I need to <q>en&shy;gage in gov&shy;ern&shy;ment</q>?</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:22</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, &#x02BC;I do not know how a man with&shy;out truthfulness is to get on. How can a large car&shy;riage be made to go with&shy;out the cross-bar for yok&shy;ing the ox&shy;en to, or a small car&shy;riage with&shy;out the ar&shy;range&shy;ment for yok&shy;ing the hors&shy;es?&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:24</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, &#x02BC;For a man to sac&shy;ri&shy;fice to a spir&shy;it which does not be&shy;long to him is flat&shy;ter&shy;y.  &#x02BC;To see what is right and not to do it is want of cour&shy;age.&#x02BC;
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>3:1</sup>&#8239;Confucius said of the head of the Chi fam&shy;i&shy;ly, who had eight rows of pan&shy;to&shy;mimes in his ar&shy;e&shy;a, &#x02BC;If he can bear to do this, what may he not bear to do?&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>3:3</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, &#x02BC;If a man be with&shy;out the vir&shy;tues prop&shy;er to hu&shy;man&shy;i&shy;ty, what has he to do with the rites of pro&shy;pri&shy;e&shy;ty?  If a man be with&shy;out the vir&shy;tues prop&shy;er to hu&shy;man&shy;i&shy;ty, what has he to do with mu&shy;sic?&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>3:4</sup>&#8239;Lin Fang asked what was the first thing to be at&shy;tended to in ceremonies.  Confucius said, &#x02BC;A great ques&shy;tion in&shy;deed!  &#x02BC;In fes&shy;tive ceremonies, it is bet&shy;ter to be spar&shy;ing than ex&shy;trav&shy;a&shy;gant. In the ceremonies of mourn&shy;ing, it is bet&shy;ter that there be deep sor&shy;row than a min&shy;ute at&shy;ten&shy;tion to ob&shy;ser&shy;vances.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>3:6</sup>&#8239;The chief of the Chi fam&shy;i&shy;ly was a&shy;bout to sac&shy;ri&shy;fice to the T&#x02BC;ai moun&shy;tain. Confucius said to Zan Yu, &#x02BC;Can you not save him from this?&#x02BC; He an&shy;swered, &#x02BC;I can&shy;not.&#x02BC; Confucius said, &#x02BC;Alas! will you say that the T&#x02BC;ai moun&shy;tain is not so dis&shy;cern&shy;ing as Lin Fang?&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>3:7</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, &#x02BC;The stu&shy;dent of vir&shy;tue has no con&shy;ten&shy;tions. If it be said he can&shy;not a&shy;void them, shall this be in ar&shy;cher&shy;y? But he bows com&shy;plai&shy;sant&shy;ly to his com&shy;pet&shy;i&shy;tors; thus he as&shy;cends the hall, de&shy;scends, and ex&shy;acts the for&shy;feit of drink&shy;ing. In his con&shy;ten&shy;tion, he is still the Chun-tsze.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>3:10</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, &#x02BC;At the great sac&shy;ri&shy;fice, af&shy;ter the pouring out of the li&shy;ba&shy;tion, I have no wish to look on.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>3:11</sup>&#8239;Some one asked the mean&shy;ing of the great sac&shy;ri&shy;fice.  The Mas&shy;ter said, &#x02BC;I do not know. He who knew its mean&shy;ing would find it as eas&shy;y to gov&shy;ern the king&shy;dom as to look on this;-- point&shy;ing to his palm.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>3:12</sup>&#8239;He sacrificed to the dead, as if they were pres&shy;ent. He sacrificed to the spir&shy;its, as if the spir&shy;its were pres&shy;ent.  Confucius said, &#x02BC;I con&shy;sid&shy;er my not be&shy;ing pres&shy;ent at the sac&shy;ri&shy;fice, as if I did not sac&shy;ri&shy;fice.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>3:16</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, &#x02BC;In ar&shy;cher&shy;y it is not go&shy;ing through the leath&shy;er which is the prin&shy;ci&shy;pal thing;-- be&shy;cause peo&shy;ple&#x02BC;s strength is not e&shy;qual. This was the old way.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>3:18</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, &#x02BC;The full ob&shy;serv&shy;ance of the rules of pro&shy;pri&shy;e&shy;ty in serv&shy;ing one&#x02BC;s prince is ac&shy;counted by peo&shy;ple to be flat&shy;ter&shy;y.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>3:20</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, &#x02BC;The Kwan Tsu is ex&shy;pres&shy;sive of en&shy;joy&shy;ment with&shy;out be&shy;ing li&shy;cen&shy;tious, and of grief with&shy;out be&shy;ing hurt&shy;ful&shy;ly ex&shy;ces&shy;sive.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>3:21</sup>&#8239;The Duke A&shy;i asked Tsai Wo a&shy;bout the al&shy;tars of the spir&shy;its of the land. Tsai Wo replied, &#x02BC;The Hsia sov&shy;er&shy;eign planted the pine tree a&shy;bout them; the men of the Yin planted the cy&shy;press;  and the men of the Chau planted the chest&shy;nut tree, mean&shy;ing there&shy;by to cause the peo&shy;ple to be in awe.&#x02BC; When the Mas&shy;ter heard it, he said, &#x02BC;Things that are done, it is need&shy;less to speak a&shy;bout; things that have had their course, it is need&shy;less to re&shy;mon&shy;strate a&shy;bout; things that are past, it is need&shy;less to blame.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>3:23</sup>&#8239;The Mas&shy;ter instructing the grand mu&shy;sic-master of Lu said, &#x02BC;How to play mu&shy;sic may be known. At the com&shy;mence&shy;ment of the piece, all the parts should sound to&shy;geth&shy;er. As it pro&shy;ceeds, they should be in har&shy;mo&shy;ny while sev&shy;er&shy;al&shy;ly dis&shy;tinct and flow&shy;ing with&shy;out break, and thus on to the con&shy;clu&shy;sion.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>3:24</sup>&#8239;The bor&shy;der war&shy;den at Yi re&shy;quested to be in&shy;tro&shy;duced to the Mas&shy;ter, say&shy;ing, &#x02BC;When men of su&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;or vir&shy;tue have come to this, I have nev&shy;er been de&shy;nied the priv&shy;i&shy;lege of see&shy;ing them.&#x02BC; The fol&shy;low&shy;ers of the sage in&shy;tro&shy;duced him, and when he came out from the in&shy;ter&shy;view, he said, &#x02BC;My friends, why are you dis&shy;tressed by your mas&shy;ter&#x02BC;s loss of of&shy;fice? The king&shy;dom has long been with&shy;out the prin&shy;ci&shy;ples of truth and right; Heav&shy;en is go&shy;ing to use your mas&shy;ter as a bell with its wood&shy;en tongue.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>3:25</sup>&#8239;Confucius said of the Shao that it was per&shy;fect&shy;ly beau&shy;ti&shy;ful and al&shy;so per&shy;fect&shy;ly good. He said of the Wu that it was per&shy;fect&shy;ly beau&shy;ti&shy;ful but not per&shy;fect&shy;ly good.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>3:26</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, &#x02BC;High sta&shy;tion filled with&shy;out in&shy;dul&shy;gent gen&shy;er&shy;os&shy;i&shy;ty; ceremonies per&shy;formed with&shy;out rev&shy;er&shy;ence;  mourn&shy;ing con&shy;ducted with&shy;out sor&shy;row;-- where&shy;with should I con&shy;tem&shy;plate such ways?&#x02BC;
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>4:1</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, &#x02BC;It is vir&shy;tu&shy;ous man&shy;ners which con&shy;sti&shy;tute the ex&shy;cel&shy;lence of a neigh&shy;bor&shy;hood. If a man in selecting a res&shy;i&shy;dence, do not fix on one where such pre&shy;vail, how can he be wise?&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>4:2</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, &#x02BC;Those who are with&shy;out vir&shy;tue can&shy;not a&shy;bide long ei&shy;ther in a con&shy;di&shy;tion of pov&shy;er&shy;ty and hard&shy;ship, or in a con&shy;di&shy;tion of en&shy;joy&shy;ment. The vir&shy;tu&shy;ous rest in vir&shy;tue; the wise de&shy;sire vir&shy;tue.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>4:4</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, &#x02BC;If the will be set on vir&shy;tue, there will be no prac&shy;tice of wick&shy;ed&shy;ness.&#x02BC;

    <sup>4:5</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, &#x02BC;Riches and honours are what men de&shy;sire. If it can&shy;not be ob&shy;tained in the prop&shy;er way, they should not be held. Pov&shy;er&shy;ty and meanness are what men dis&shy;like. If it can&shy;not be a&shy;voided in the prop&shy;er way, they should not be a&shy;voided.  &#x02BC;If a su&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;or man a&shy;ban&shy;don vir&shy;tue, how can he ful&shy;fil the re&shy;quire&shy;ments of that name?  &#x02BC;The su&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;or man does not, e&shy;ven for the space of a sin&shy;gle meal, act con&shy;tra&shy;ry to vir&shy;tue. In mo&shy;ments of haste, he cleaves to it.  In sea&shy;sons of dan&shy;ger, he cleaves to it.&#x02BC;

<p>
    <sup>4:6</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, &#x02BC;I have not seen a per&shy;son who loved vir&shy;tue, or one who hat&shy;ed what was not vir&shy;tu&shy;ous. He who loved vir&shy;tue, would es&shy;teem noth&shy;ing a&shy;bove it. He who hat&shy;ed what is not vir&shy;tu&shy;ous, would prac&shy;tise vir&shy;tue in such a way that he would not al&shy;low any&shy;thing that is not vir&shy;tu&shy;ous to ap&shy;proach his per&shy;son.  &#x02BC;Is any one a&shy;ble for one day to ap&shy;ply his strength to vir&shy;tue?  I have not seen the case in which his strength would be in&shy;suf&shy;fi&shy;cient.  &#x02BC;Should there pos&shy;si&shy;bly be any such case, I have not seen it.&#x02BC;

    <sup>4:7</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, &#x02BC;The faults of men are char&shy;ac&shy;ter&shy;is&shy;tic of the class to which they be&shy;long. By ob&shy;serv&shy;ing a man&#x02BC;s faults, it may be known that he is vir&shy;tu&shy;ous.&#x02BC;

    <sup>4:8</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, &#x02BC;If a man in the morn&shy;ing hear the right way, he may die in the eve&shy;ning with&shy;out re&shy;gret.&#x02BC;

    <sup>4:9</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, &#x02BC;A schol&shy;ar, whose mind is set on truth, and who is a&shy;shamed of bad clothes and bad food, is not fit to be dis&shy;coursed with.&#x02BC;

<p>
    <sup>4:10</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, &#x02BC;The su&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;or man, in the world, does not set his mind ei&shy;ther for any&shy;thing, or a&shy;gainst any&shy;thing; what is right he will fol&shy;low.&#x02BC;

<p>
    <sup>4:11</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, &#x02BC;The su&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;or man thinks of vir&shy;tue;  the small man thinks of com&shy;fort. The su&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;or man thinks of the sanc&shy;tions of law; the small man thinks of fa&shy;vours which he may re&shy;ceive.&#x02BC;

    <sup>4:13</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, &#x02BC;If a prince is a&shy;ble to gov&shy;ern his king&shy;dom with the com&shy;plai&shy;sance prop&shy;er to the rules of pro&shy;pri&shy;e&shy;ty, what dif&shy;fi&shy;cul&shy;ty will he have?

<p>
    <sup>4:14</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, &#x02BC;A man should say, I am not con&shy;cerned that I have no place, I am con&shy;cerned how I may fit my&shy;self for one. I am not con&shy;cerned that I am not known, I seek to be wor&shy;thy to be known.&#x02BC;

    <sup>4:15</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, &#x02BC;Shan, my doc&shy;trine is that of an all-pervading u&shy;ni&shy;ty.&#x02BC; The dis&shy;ci&shy;ple Tsang replied, &#x02BC;Yes.&#x02BC; The Mas&shy;ter went out, and the oth&shy;er dis&shy;ci&shy;ples asked, say&shy;ing, &#x02BC;What do his words mean?&#x02BC; Tsang said, &#x02BC;The doc&shy;trine of our mas&shy;ter is to be true to the prin&shy;ci&shy;ples of our na&shy;ture and the be&shy;nev&shy;o&shy;lent ex&shy;er&shy;cise of them to oth&shy;ers,-- this and noth&shy;ing more.&#x02BC;

<p>
    <sup>4:16</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, &#x02BC;The mind of the su&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;or man is con&shy;ver&shy;sant with right&shy;eous&shy;ness; the mind of the mean man is con&shy;ver&shy;sant with gain.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>4:17</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, &#x02BC;When we see men of worth, we should think of e&shy;qual&shy;ling them; when we see men of a con&shy;tra&shy;ry char&shy;ac&shy;ter, we should turn in&shy;wards and ex&shy;am&shy;ine our&shy;selves.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>4:18</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, &#x02BC;In serv&shy;ing his par&shy;ents, a son may re&shy;mon&shy;strate with them, but gen&shy;tly; when he sees that they do not in&shy;cline to fol&shy;low his ad&shy;vice, he shows an in&shy;creased de&shy;gree of rev&shy;er&shy;ence, but does not a&shy;ban&shy;don his pur&shy;pose; and should they pun&shy;ish him, he does not al&shy;low him&shy;self to mur&shy;mur.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>4:22</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, &#x02BC;The rea&shy;son why the an&shy;cients did not read&shy;i&shy;ly give ut&shy;ter&shy;ance to their words, was that they feared lest their ac&shy;tions should not come up to them.&#x02BC;

    <sup>4:25</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, &#x02BC;Virtue is not left to stand a&shy;lone. He who prac&shy;tises it will have neigh&shy;bors.&#x02BC;

<p>
    <sup>4:26</sup>&#8239;Tsze-yu said, &#x02BC;In serv&shy;ing a prince, fre&shy;quent re&shy;mon&shy;strances lead to dis&shy;grace. Be&shy;tween friends, fre&shy;quent re&shy;proofs make the friend&shy;ship dis&shy;tant.&#x02BC;

    <sup>5:9</sup>&#8239;Tsai Yu be&shy;ing a&shy;sleep dur&shy;ing the day&shy;time, the Mas&shy;ter said, &#x02BC;Rotten wood can&shy;not be carved; a wall of dirt&shy;y earth will not re&shy;ceive the trow&shy;el. This Yu!-- what is the use of my re&shy;prov&shy;ing him?&#x02BC; The Mas&shy;ter said, &#x02BC;At first, my way with men was to hear their words, and give them cred&shy;it for their con&shy;duct.

    <sup>5:22</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, &#x02BC;Po-i and Shu-ch&#x02BC;i did not keep the form&shy;er wickednesses of men in mind, and hence the re&shy;sent&shy;ments di&shy;rect&shy;ed to&shy;wards them were few.&#x02BC;

    <sup>7:4</sup>&#8239;When the Mas&shy;ter was un&shy;oc&shy;cu&shy;pied with busi&shy;ness, his man&shy;ner was eas&shy;y, and he looked pleased.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>7:6</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, &#x02BC;Let the will be set on the path of du&shy;ty.  &#x02BC;Let eve&shy;ry at&shy;tain&shy;ment in what is good be firm&shy;ly grasped.  &#x02BC;Let per&shy;fect vir&shy;tue be ac&shy;corded with.  &#x02BC;Let re&shy;lax&shy;a&shy;tion and en&shy;joy&shy;ment be found in the po&shy;lite arts.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>7:7</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, &#x02BC;From the man bring&shy;ing his bun&shy;dle of dried flesh for my teach&shy;ing up&shy;wards, I have nev&shy;er re&shy;fused in&shy;struc&shy;tion to any one.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>7:8</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, &#x02BC;I do not o&shy;pen up the truth to one who is not ea&shy;ger to get knowl&shy;edge, nor help out any one who is not anx&shy;ious to ex&shy;plain him&shy;self. When I have pre&shy;sented one cor&shy;ner of a sub&shy;ject to any one, and he can&shy;not from it learn the oth&shy;er three, I do not re&shy;peat my les&shy;son.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>7:9</sup>&#8239;When the Mas&shy;ter was eat&shy;ing by the side of a mourn&shy;er, he nev&shy;er ate to the full.  He did not sing on the same day in which he had been weep&shy;ing.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>7:10</sup>&#8239;Confucius said to Yen Yu&shy;an, &#x02BC;When called to of&shy;fice, to un&shy;der&shy;take its duties; when not so called, to lie re&shy;tired;-- it is on&shy;ly I and you who have at&shy;tained to this.&#x02BC; Tsze-lu said, &#x02BC;If you had the con&shy;duct of the armies of a great State, whom would you have to act with you?&#x02BC; Confucius said, &#x02BC;I would not have him to act with me, who will un&shy;armed at&shy;tack a ti&shy;ger, or cross a riv&shy;er with&shy;out a boat, dy&shy;ing with&shy;out any re&shy;gret. My as&shy;so&shy;ci&shy;ate must be the man who pro&shy;ceeds to ac&shy;tion full of so&shy;lic&shy;i&shy;tude, who is fond of adjusting his plans, and then carries them in&shy;to ex&shy;e&shy;cu&shy;tion.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>7:11</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, &#x02BC;If the search for rich&shy;es is sure to be suc&shy;cess&shy;ful, though I should be&shy;come a groom with whip in hand to get them, I will do so. As the search may not be suc&shy;cess&shy;ful, I will fol&shy;low af&shy;ter that which I love.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>7:12</sup>&#8239;The things in ref&shy;er&shy;ence to which the Mas&shy;ter ex&shy;er&shy;cised the great&shy;est cau&shy;tion were -- fasting, war, and sick&shy;ness.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>7:14</sup>&#8239;Yen Yu said, &#x02BC;Is our Mas&shy;ter for the rul&shy;er of Wei?&#x02BC; Tsze-kung said, &#x02BC;Oh! I will ask him.&#x02BC; He went in ac&shy;cord&shy;ing&shy;ly, and said, &#x02BC;What sort of men were Po-i and Shu-ch&#x02BC;i?&#x02BC; &#x02BC;They were an&shy;cient worthies,&#x02BC; said the Mas&shy;ter.  &#x02BC;Did they have any re&shy;pin&shy;ings be&shy;cause of their course?&#x02BC; The Mas&shy;ter a&shy;gain replied, &#x02BC;They sought to act vir&shy;tu&shy;ous&shy;ly, and they did so; what was there for them to re&shy;pine a&shy;bout?&#x02BC; On this, Tsze-kung went out and said, &#x02BC;Our Mas&shy;ter is not for him.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>7:15</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, &#x02BC;With coarse rice to eat, with wa&shy;ter to drink, and my bend&shy;ed arm for a pil&shy;low;-- I have still joy in the midst of these things. Rich&shy;es and honours ac&shy;quired by unrighteousness, are to me as a float&shy;ing cloud.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>7:16</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, &#x02BC;If some years were added to my life, I would give fif&shy;ty to the stud&shy;y of the Yi, and then I might come to be with&shy;out great faults.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>7:17</sup>&#8239;The Mas&shy;ter&#x02BC;s fre&shy;quent themes of dis&shy;course were-- the Odes, the His&shy;to&shy;ry, and the main&shy;te&shy;nance of the Rules of Pro&shy;pri&shy;e&shy;ty. On all these he fre&shy;quent&shy;ly dis&shy;coursed.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>7:18</sup>&#8239;The Duke of Sheh asked Tsze-lu a&shy;bout Confucius, and Tsze-lu did not an&shy;swer him.  Confucius said, &#x02BC;Why did you not say to him,-- He is simp&shy;ly a man, who in his ea&shy;ger pur&shy;suit (of knowl&shy;edge) for&shy;gets his food, who in the joy of its at&shy;tain&shy;ment for&shy;gets his sor&shy;rows, and who does not per&shy;ceive that old age is com&shy;ing on?&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>7:19</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, &#x02BC;I am not one who was born in the pos&shy;ses&shy;sion of knowl&shy;edge; I am one who is fond of an&shy;tiq&shy;ui&shy;ty, and ear&shy;nest in seek&shy;ing it there.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>7:20</sup>&#8239;The sub&shy;jects on which the Mas&shy;ter did not talk, were-- ex&shy;traor&shy;di&shy;nar&shy;y things, feats of strength, dis&shy;or&shy;der, and spir&shy;it&shy;u&shy;al be&shy;ings.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>7:21</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, &#x02BC;When I walk a&shy;long with two oth&shy;ers, they may serve me as my teach&shy;ers. I will se&shy;lect their good qualities and fol&shy;low them, their bad qualities and a&shy;void them.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>7:23</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, &#x02BC;Do you think, my dis&shy;ci&shy;ples, that I have any con&shy;ceal&shy;ments? I con&shy;ceal noth&shy;ing from you. There is noth&shy;ing which I do that is not shown to you, my dis&shy;ci&shy;ples;-- that is my way.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>7:24</sup>&#8239;There were four things which the Mas&shy;ter taught,-- let&shy;ters, eth&shy;ics, de&shy;vo&shy;tion of soul, and truthfulness.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>7:25</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, &#x02BC;A sage it is not mine to see;  could I see a man of re&shy;al tal&shy;ent and vir&shy;tue, that would sat&shy;is&shy;fy me.&#x02BC; The Mas&shy;ter said, &#x02BC;A good man it is not mine to see; could I see a man pos&shy;sessed of con&shy;stan&shy;cy, that would sat&shy;is&shy;fy me.  &#x02BC;Having not and yet af&shy;fect&shy;ing to have, emp&shy;ty and yet af&shy;fect&shy;ing to be full, strait&shy;ened and yet af&shy;fect&shy;ing to be at ease:-- it is dif&shy;fi&shy;cult with such char&shy;ac&shy;ter&shy;is&shy;tics to have con&shy;stan&shy;cy.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>7:26</sup>&#8239;The Mas&shy;ter an&shy;gled,-- but did not use a net. He shot,-- but not at birds perching.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>7:27</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, &#x02BC;There may be those who act with&shy;out know&shy;ing why. I do not do so. Hear&shy;ing much and selecting what is good and fol&shy;low&shy;ing it; see&shy;ing much and keep&shy;ing it in mem&shy;o&shy;ry:-- this is the sec&shy;ond style of knowl&shy;edge.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>7:28</sup>&#8239;It was dif&shy;fi&shy;cult to talk (profitably and rep&shy;u&shy;ta&shy;bly) with the peo&shy;ple of Hu-hsiang, and a lad of that place hav&shy;ing had an in&shy;ter&shy;view with the Mas&shy;ter, the dis&shy;ci&shy;ples doubted.  The Mas&shy;ter said, &#x02BC;I ad&shy;mit peo&shy;ple&#x02BC;s ap&shy;proach to me with&shy;out com&shy;mit&shy;ting my&shy;self as to what they may do when they have re&shy;tired.  Why must one be so se&shy;vere? If a man pu&shy;ri&shy;fy him&shy;self to wait up&shy;on me, I re&shy;ceive him so pu&shy;ri&shy;fied, with&shy;out guar&shy;an&shy;tee&shy;ing his past con&shy;duct.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>7:30</sup>&#8239;The min&shy;is&shy;ter of crime of Ch&#x02BC;an asked wheth&shy;er the duke Chao knew pro&shy;pri&shy;e&shy;ty, and Confucius said, &#x02BC;He knew pro&shy;pri&shy;e&shy;ty.&#x02BC; Confucius hav&shy;ing re&shy;tired, the min&shy;is&shy;ter bowed to Wu-ma Ch&#x02BC;i to come for&shy;ward, and said, &#x02BC;I have heard that the su&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;or man is not a par&shy;ti&shy;san. May the su&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;or man be a par&shy;ti&shy;san al&shy;so? The prince mar&shy;ried a daugh&shy;ter of the house of Wu, of the same sur&shy;name with him&shy;self, and called her,-- "The eld&shy;er Tsze of Wu." If the prince knew pro&shy;pri&shy;e&shy;ty, who does not know it?&#x02BC; Wu-ma Ch&#x02BC;i re&shy;ported these re&shy;marks, and the Mas&shy;ter said, &#x02BC;I am for&shy;tu&shy;nate! If I have any er&shy;rors, peo&shy;ple are sure to know them.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>7:31</sup>&#8239;When the Mas&shy;ter was in com&shy;pa&shy;ny with a per&shy;son who was sing&shy;ing, if he sang well, he would make him re&shy;peat the song, while he ac&shy;com&shy;pa&shy;nied it with his own voice.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>7:32</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, &#x02BC;In let&shy;ters I am per&shy;haps e&shy;qual to oth&shy;er men, but the char&shy;ac&shy;ter of the su&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;or man, car&shy;ry&shy;ing out in his con&shy;duct what he professes, is what I have not yet at&shy;tained to.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>7:33</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, &#x02BC;The sage and the man of per&shy;fect vir&shy;tue;-- how dare I rank my&shy;self with them? It may simp&shy;ly be said of me, that I strive to be&shy;come such with&shy;out sa&shy;ti&shy;e&shy;ty, and teach oth&shy;ers with&shy;out wea&shy;ri&shy;ness.&#x02BC; Kung-hsi Hwa said, &#x02BC;This is just what we, the dis&shy;ci&shy;ples, can&shy;not im&shy;i&shy;tate you in.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>7:34</sup>&#8239;The Mas&shy;ter be&shy;ing ver&shy;y sick, Tsze-lu asked leave to pray for him. He said, &#x02BC;May such a thing be done?&#x02BC; Tsze-lu replied, &#x02BC;It may. In the Eulogies it is said, "Prayer has been made for thee to the spir&shy;its of the up&shy;per and low&shy;er worlds."&#x02BC; Confucius said, &#x02BC;My praying has been for a long time.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>7:35</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, &#x02BC;Extravagance leads to in&shy;sub&shy;or&shy;di&shy;na&shy;tion, and par&shy;si&shy;mo&shy;ny to meanness. It is bet&shy;ter to be mean than to be in&shy;sub&shy;or&shy;di&shy;nate.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>7:36</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, &#x02BC;The su&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;or man is sat&shy;is&shy;fied and com&shy;posed; the mean man is al&shy;ways full of dis&shy;tress.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>7:37</sup>&#8239;The Mas&shy;ter was mild, and yet dig&shy;ni&shy;fied; ma&shy;jes&shy;tic, and yet not fierce; re&shy;spect&shy;ful, and yet eas&shy;y.
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>8:1</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, &#x02BC;T&#x02BC;ai-po may be said to have reached the highest point of vir&shy;tu&shy;ous ac&shy;tion. Thrice he de&shy;clined the king&shy;dom, and the peo&shy;ple in ig&shy;no&shy;rance of his mo&shy;tives could not ex&shy;press their ap&shy;pro&shy;ba&shy;tion of his con&shy;duct.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>8:2</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, &#x02BC;Respectfulness, with&shy;out the rules of pro&shy;pri&shy;e&shy;ty, be&shy;comes la&shy;bo&shy;ri&shy;ous bus&shy;tle; care&shy;ful&shy;ness, with&shy;out the rules of pro&shy;pri&shy;e&shy;ty, be&shy;comes ti&shy;mid&shy;i&shy;ty; bold&shy;ness, with&shy;out the rules of pro&shy;pri&shy;e&shy;ty, be&shy;comes in&shy;sub&shy;or&shy;di&shy;na&shy;tion; straight&shy;for&shy;ward&shy;ness, with&shy;out the rules of pro&shy;pri&shy;e&shy;ty, be&shy;comes rude&shy;ness.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>8:4</sup>&#8239;The phi&shy;los&shy;o&shy;pher Tsang be&shy;ing ill, Meng Chang went to ask how he was.  Tsang said to him, &#x02BC;When a bird is a&shy;bout to die, its notes are mourn&shy;ful; when a man is a&shy;bout to die, his words are good.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>8:5</sup>&#8239;The phi&shy;los&shy;o&shy;pher Tsang said, &#x02BC;Gifted with a&shy;bil&shy;i&shy;ty, and yet put&shy;ting ques&shy;tions to those who were not so; pos&shy;sessed of much, and yet put&shy;ting ques&shy;tions to those pos&shy;sessed of lit&shy;tle; hav&shy;ing, as though he had not; full, and yet counting him&shy;self as emp&shy;ty;  of&shy;fended a&shy;gainst, and yet entering in&shy;to no al&shy;ter&shy;ca&shy;tion; for&shy;mer&shy;ly I had a friend who pur&shy;sued this style of con&shy;duct.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>8:6</sup>&#8239;The phi&shy;los&shy;o&shy;pher Tsang said, &#x02BC;Suppose that there is an in&shy;di&shy;vid&shy;u&shy;al who can be en&shy;trusted with the charge of a young or&shy;phan prince, and can be com&shy;mis&shy;sioned with au&shy;thor&shy;i&shy;ty o&shy;ver a state of a hun&shy;dred li, and whom no e&shy;mer&shy;gen&shy;cy how&shy;ev&shy;er great can drive from his prin&shy;ci&shy;ples:-- is such a man a su&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;or man? He is a su&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;or man in&shy;deed.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>8:8</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, &#x02BC;It is by the Odes that the mind is a&shy;roused.  &#x02BC;It is by the Rules of Pro&shy;pri&shy;e&shy;ty that the char&shy;ac&shy;ter is es&shy;tab&shy;lished. &#x02BC;It is from Mu&shy;sic that the fin&shy;ish is re&shy;ceived.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>8:9</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, &#x02BC;The peo&shy;ple may be made to fol&shy;low a path of ac&shy;tion, but they may not be made to un&shy;der&shy;stand it.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>8:10</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, &#x02BC;The man who is fond of dar&shy;ing and is dis&shy;sat&shy;is&shy;fied with pov&shy;er&shy;ty, will pro&shy;ceed to in&shy;sub&shy;or&shy;di&shy;na&shy;tion. So will the man who is not vir&shy;tu&shy;ous, when you car&shy;ry your dis&shy;like of him to an ex&shy;treme.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>8:11</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, &#x02BC;Though a man have abilities as ad&shy;mi&shy;ra&shy;ble as those of the Duke of Chau, yet if he be proud and nig&shy;gard&shy;ly, those oth&shy;er things are re&shy;al&shy;ly not worth be&shy;ing looked at.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>8:13</sup>&#8239;&#x02BC;When a coun&shy;try is well-governed, pov&shy;er&shy;ty and a mean con&shy;di&shy;tion are things to be a&shy;shamed of. When a coun&shy;try is ill-governed, rich&shy;es and honour are things to be a&shy;shamed of.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>8:14</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, &#x02BC;He who is not in any par&shy;tic&shy;u&shy;lar of&shy;fice, has noth&shy;ing to do with plans for the ad&shy;min&shy;is&shy;tra&shy;tion of its duties.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>8:16</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, &#x02BC;Ardent and yet not up&shy;right; stu&shy;pid and yet not at&shy;ten&shy;tive; sim&shy;ple and yet not sin&shy;cere:-- such per&shy;sons I do not un&shy;der&shy;stand.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>8:21</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, &#x02BC;I can find no flaw in the char&shy;ac&shy;ter of Yu. He used him&shy;self coarse food and drink, but dis&shy;played the ut&shy;most fil&shy;ial pi&shy;e&shy;ty to&shy;wards the spir&shy;its. His or&shy;di&shy;nar&shy;y gar&shy;ments were poor, but he dis&shy;played the ut&shy;most el&shy;e&shy;gance in his sac&shy;ri&shy;fi&shy;cial cap and a&shy;pron. He lived in a low mean house, but ex&shy;pended all his strength on the ditches and wa&shy;ter-channels. I can find noth&shy;ing like a flaw in Yu.&#x02BC;
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>9:1</sup>&#8239;The sub&shy;jects of which the Mas&shy;ter sel&shy;dom spoke were-- prof&shy;it&shy;a&shy;ble&shy;ness, and al&shy;so the ap&shy;point&shy;ments of Heav&shy;en, and per&shy;fect vir&shy;tue.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>9:3</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, &#x02BC;The lin&shy;en cap is that pre&shy;scribed by the rules of cer&shy;e&shy;mo&shy;ny, but now a silk one is worn. It is e&shy;co&shy;nom&shy;i&shy;cal, and I fol&shy;low the com&shy;mon prac&shy;tice.  &#x02BC;The rules of cer&shy;e&shy;mo&shy;ny pre&shy;scribe the bow&shy;ing be&shy;low the hall, but now the prac&shy;tice is to bow on&shy;ly af&shy;ter as&shy;cend&shy;ing it. That is ar&shy;ro&shy;gant. I con&shy;tin&shy;ue to bow be&shy;low the hall, though I op&shy;pose the com&shy;mon prac&shy;tice.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>9:4</sup>&#8239;There were four things from which the Mas&shy;ter was en&shy;tire&shy;ly free. He had no fore&shy;gone con&shy;clu&shy;sions, no ar&shy;bi&shy;trar&shy;y pre&shy;de&shy;ter&shy;mi&shy;na&shy;tions, no ob&shy;sti&shy;na&shy;cy, and no e&shy;go&shy;ism.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>9:5</sup>&#8239;The Mas&shy;ter was put in fear in K&#x02BC;wang.

And, more&shy;o&shy;ver, his a&shy;bil&shy;i&shy;ty is var&shy;i&shy;ous.&#x02BC; The Mas&shy;ter heard of the con&shy;ver&shy;sa&shy;tion and said, &#x02BC;Does the high of&shy;fic&shy;er know me? When I was young, my con&shy;di&shy;tion was low, and there&shy;fore I ac&shy;quired my a&shy;bil&shy;i&shy;ty in man&shy;y things, but they were mean mat&shy;ters. Must the su&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;or man have such va&shy;ri&shy;e&shy;ty of a&shy;bil&shy;i&shy;ty?  He does not need va&shy;ri&shy;e&shy;ty of a&shy;bil&shy;i&shy;ty.&#x02BC; Lao said, &#x02BC;Confucius said, "Having no of&shy;fi&shy;cial em&shy;ploy&shy;ment, I ac&shy;quired man&shy;y arts."&#x02BC;

<p>
    <sup>9:7</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, &#x02BC;Am I in&shy;deed pos&shy;sessed of knowl&shy;edge? I am not know&shy;ing. But if a mean per&shy;son, who ap&shy;pears quite emp&shy;ty-like, ask any&shy;thing of me, I set it forth from one end to the oth&shy;er, and ex&shy;haust it.&#x02BC;

    <sup>9:13</sup>&#8239;The Mas&shy;ter was wishing to go and live a&shy;mong the nine wild tribes of the east.  Some one said, &#x02BC;They are rude.

    <sup>9:15</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, &#x02BC;Abroad, to serve the high min&shy;is&shy;ters and no&shy;bles; at home, to serve one&#x02BC;s fa&shy;ther and eld&shy;er broth&shy;ers; in all duties to the dead, not to dare not to ex&shy;ert one&#x02BC;s self;  and not to be o&shy;ver&shy;come of wine:-- which one of these things do I at&shy;tain to?&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>9:17</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, &#x02BC;I have not seen one who loves vir&shy;tue as he loves beau&shy;ty.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>9:18</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, &#x02BC;The pros&shy;e&shy;cu&shy;tion of learn&shy;ing may be com&shy;pared to what may hap&shy;pen in rais&shy;ing a mound. If there want but one bas&shy;ket of earth to com&shy;plete the work, and I stop, the stop&shy;ping is my own work. It may be com&shy;pared to throwing down the earth on the lev&shy;el ground. Though but one bas&shy;ket&shy;ful is thrown at a time, the ad&shy;vanc&shy;ing with it is my own go&shy;ing for&shy;ward.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>9:21</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, &#x02BC;There are cases in which the blade springs, but the plant does not go on to flow&shy;er! There are cases where it flow&shy;ers, but no fruit is sub&shy;se&shy;quent&shy;ly pro&shy;duced!&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>9:22</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, &#x02BC;A youth is to be re&shy;garded with re&shy;spect. How do we know that his fu&shy;ture will not be e&shy;qual to our pres&shy;ent? If he reach the age of for&shy;ty or fif&shy;ty, and has not made him&shy;self heard of, then in&shy;deed he will not be worth be&shy;ing re&shy;garded with re&shy;spect.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>9:23</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, &#x02BC;Can men ref&shy;use to as&shy;sent to the words of strict ad&shy;mo&shy;ni&shy;tion? But it is reforming the con&shy;duct be&shy;cause of them which is val&shy;u&shy;a&shy;ble. Can men ref&shy;use to be pleased with words of gen&shy;tle ad&shy;vice? But it is unfolding their aim which is val&shy;u&shy;a&shy;ble. If a man be pleased with these words, but does not un&shy;fold their aim, and as&shy;sents to those, but does not re&shy;form his con&shy;duct, I can re&shy;al&shy;ly do noth&shy;ing with him.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>9:24</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, &#x02BC;Hold faith&shy;ful&shy;ness and sin&shy;cer&shy;i&shy;ty as first prin&shy;ci&shy;ples. Have no friends not e&shy;qual to your&shy;self. When you have faults, do not fear to a&shy;ban&shy;don them.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>9:25</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, &#x02BC;The com&shy;mand&shy;er of the forces of a large state may be car&shy;ried off, but the will of e&shy;ven a com&shy;mon man can&shy;not be tak&shy;en from him.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>9:26</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, &#x02BC;Dressed him&shy;self in a tat&shy;tered robe quilt&shy;ed with hemp, yet stand&shy;ing by the side of men dressed in furs, and not a&shy;shamed;-- ah! it is Yu who is e&shy;qual to this!  &#x02BC;"He dis&shy;likes none, he cov&shy;ets noth&shy;ing;-- what can he do but what is good!"&#x02BC; Tsze-lu kept con&shy;tin&shy;u&shy;al&shy;ly repeating these words of the ode, when the Mas&shy;ter said, &#x02BC;Those things are by no means suf&shy;fi&shy;cient to con&shy;sti&shy;tute (perfect) ex&shy;cel&shy;lence.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>9:28</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, &#x02BC;The wise are free from perplexities; the vir&shy;tu&shy;ous from anx&shy;i&shy;e&shy;ty; and the bold from fear.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>9:29</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, &#x02BC;There are some with whom we may stud&shy;y in com&shy;mon, but we shall find them un&shy;a&shy;ble to go a&shy;long with us to prin&shy;ci&shy;ples. Per&shy;haps we may go on with them to prin&shy;ci&shy;ples, but we shall find them un&shy;a&shy;ble to get es&shy;tab&shy;lished in those a&shy;long with us. Or if we may get so es&shy;tab&shy;lished a&shy;long with them, we shall find them un&shy;a&shy;ble to weigh oc&shy;cur&shy;ring e&shy;vents a&shy;long with us.&#x02BC;

<p>
    <sup>10:1</sup>&#8239;Confucius, in his vil&shy;lage, looked sim&shy;ple and sin&shy;cere, and as if he were not a&shy;ble to speak.  When he was in the prince&#x02BC;s ancestorial tem&shy;ple, or in the court, he spoke min&shy;ute&shy;ly on eve&shy;ry point, but cau&shy;tious&shy;ly.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>10:2</sup>&#8239;When he was waiting at court, in speak&shy;ing with the great of&shy;fic&shy;ers of the low&shy;er grade, he spake free&shy;ly, but in a straight&shy;for&shy;ward man&shy;ner; in speak&shy;ing with those of the higher grade, he did so bland&shy;ly, but pre&shy;cise&shy;ly.  When the rul&shy;er was pres&shy;ent, his man&shy;ner dis&shy;played re&shy;spect&shy;ful un&shy;eas&shy;i&shy;ness; it was gra&shy;ve, but self-possessed.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>10:6</sup>&#8239;The su&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;or man did not use a deep pur&shy;ple, or a puce colour, in the or&shy;na&shy;ments of his dress.  E&shy;ven in his un&shy;dress, he did not wear any&shy;thing of a red or red&shy;dish colour.  In warm weath&shy;er, he had a sin&shy;gle gar&shy;ment ei&shy;ther of coarse or fi&shy;ne tex&shy;ture, but he wore it dis&shy;played o&shy;ver an in&shy;ner gar&shy;ment.  O&shy;ver lamb&#x02BC;s fur he wore a gar&shy;ment of black; o&shy;ver fawn&#x02BC;s fur one of white; and o&shy;ver fox&#x02BC;s fur one of yel&shy;low.  The fur robe of his un&shy;dress was long, with the right sleeve short.  He re&shy;quired his sleep&shy;ing dress to be half as long a&shy;gain as his bod&shy;y.  When stay&shy;ing at home, he used thick furs of the fox or the badg&shy;er.  When he put off mourn&shy;ing, he wore all the ap&shy;pend&shy;ages of the gir&shy;dle.  His un&shy;der-garment, ex&shy;cept when it was re&shy;quired to be of the cur&shy;tain shape, was made of silk cut nar&shy;row a&shy;bove and wide be&shy;low.  He did not wear lamb&#x02BC;s fur or a black cap, on a vis&shy;it of con&shy;do&shy;lence.  On the first day of the month he put on his court robes, and pre&shy;sented him&shy;self at court.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>10:7</sup>&#8239;When fasting, he thought it nec&shy;es&shy;sar&shy;y to have his clothes bright&shy;ly clean and made of lin&shy;en cloth.  When fasting, he thought it nec&shy;es&shy;sar&shy;y to change his food, and al&shy;so to change the place where he com&shy;mon&shy;ly sat in the a&shy;part&shy;ment.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>10:8</sup>&#8239;He did not dis&shy;like to have his rice fine&shy;ly cleaned, nor to have his minced meat cut quite small.  He did not eat rice which had been in&shy;jured by heat or damp and turned sour, nor fish or flesh which was gone. He did not eat what was discoloured, or what was of a bad fla&shy;vour, nor any&shy;thing which was ill-cooked, or was not in sea&shy;son.  He did not eat meat which was not cut prop&shy;er&shy;ly, nor what was served with&shy;out its prop&shy;er sauce.  Though there might be a large quan&shy;ti&shy;ty of meat, he would not al&shy;low what he took to ex&shy;ceed the due pro&shy;por&shy;tion for the rice. It was on&shy;ly in wine that he laid down no lim&shy;it for him&shy;self, but he did not al&shy;low him&shy;self to be con&shy;fused by it.  He did not par&shy;take of wine and dried meat bought in the mar&shy;ket.  He was nev&shy;er with&shy;out gin&shy;ger when he ate.  He did not eat much.  When he had been assisting at the prince&#x02BC;s sac&shy;ri&shy;fice, he did not keep the flesh which he re&shy;ceived o&shy;ver&shy;night. The flesh of his fam&shy;i&shy;ly sac&shy;ri&shy;fice he did not keep o&shy;ver three days. If kept o&shy;ver three days, peo&shy;ple could not eat it. When eat&shy;ing, he did not con&shy;verse. When in bed, he did not speak. Al&shy;though his food might be coarse rice and veg&shy;e&shy;ta&shy;ble soup, he would of&shy;fer a lit&shy;tle of it in sac&shy;ri&shy;fice with a gra&shy;ve, re&shy;spect&shy;ful air.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>10:9</sup>&#8239;If his mat was not straight, he did not sit on it.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>10:12</sup>&#8239;The sta&shy;ble be&shy;ing burned down, when he was at court, on his re&shy;turn he said, &#x02BC;Has any man been hurt?&#x02BC; He did not ask a&shy;bout the hors&shy;es.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>10:13</sup>&#8239;When the prince sent him a gift of cooked meat, he would ad&shy;just his mat, first taste it, and then give it a&shy;way to oth&shy;ers. When the prince sent him a gift of un&shy;dressed meat, he would have it cooked, and of&shy;fer it to the spir&shy;its of his an&shy;ces&shy;tors.  When the prince sent him a gift of a liv&shy;ing an&shy;i&shy;mal, he would keep it a&shy;live.  When he was in at&shy;tend&shy;ance on the prince and joining in the en&shy;ter&shy;tain&shy;ment, the prince on&shy;ly sacrificed. He first tast&shy;ed eve&shy;ry&shy;thing.  When he was ill and the prince came to vis&shy;it him, he had his head to the east, made his court robes be spread o&shy;ver him, and drew his gir&shy;dle a&shy;cross them.  When the prince&#x02BC;s or&shy;der called him, with&shy;out waiting for his car&shy;riage to be yoked, he went at once.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>10:14</sup>&#8239;When he en&shy;tered the an&shy;ces&shy;tral tem&shy;ple of the State, he asked a&shy;bout eve&shy;ry&shy;thing.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>10:15</sup>&#8239;When any of his friends died, if he had no re&shy;la&shy;tions who could be de&shy;pended on for the nec&shy;es&shy;sar&shy;y of&shy;fices, he would say, &#x02BC;I will bur&shy;y him.&#x02BC; When a friend sent him a pres&shy;ent, though it might be a car&shy;riage and hors&shy;es, he did not bow.  The on&shy;ly pres&shy;ent for which he bowed was that of the flesh of sac&shy;ri&shy;fice.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>10:17</sup>&#8239;When he was a&shy;bout to mount his car&shy;riage, he would stand straight, hold&shy;ing the cord.  When he was in the car&shy;riage, he did not turn his head quite round, he did not talk hast&shy;i&shy;ly, he did not point with his hands.

    <sup>11:1</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, &#x02BC;The men of form&shy;er times, in the mat&shy;ters of ceremonies and mu&shy;sic were rus&shy;tics, it is said, while the men of these lat&shy;ter times, in ceremonies and mu&shy;sic, are ac&shy;com&shy;plished gentlemen.  &#x02BC;If I have oc&shy;ca&shy;sion to use those things, I fol&shy;low the men of form&shy;er times.&#x02BC;

</p>

<p>
    <sup>11:13</sup>&#8239;Some parties in Lu were go&shy;ing to take down and re&shy;build the Long Treas&shy;ur&shy;y.  Min Tsze-ch&#x02BC;ien said, &#x02BC;Suppose it were to be re&shy;paired af&shy;ter its old style;-- why must it be al&shy;tered and made a&shy;new?&#x02BC; Confucius said, &#x02BC;This man sel&shy;dom speaks; when he does, he is sure to hit the point.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>11:15</sup>&#8239;Tsze-kung asked which of the two, Shih or Shang, was the su&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;or.

</p>

<p>
    <sup>11:18</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, &#x02BC;There is Hui! He has near&shy;ly at&shy;tained to per&shy;fect vir&shy;tue. He is of&shy;ten in want.  &#x02BC;Ts&#x02BC;ze does not ac&shy;qui&shy;esce in the ap&shy;point&shy;ments of Heav&shy;en, and his goods are in&shy;creased by him.

<p>
    <sup>11:19</sup>&#8239;Tsze-chang asked what were the char&shy;ac&shy;ter&shy;is&shy;tics of the GOOD man. Confucius said, &#x02BC;He does not tread in the foot&shy;steps of oth&shy;ers, but more&shy;o&shy;ver, he does not en&shy;ter the cham&shy;ber of the sage.&#x02BC;
</p>

If a man can for one day sub&shy;due him&shy;self and re&shy;turn to pro&shy;pri&shy;e&shy;ty, all un&shy;der heav&shy;en will as&shy;cribe per&shy;fect vir&shy;tue to him.

The man, who in the view of gain, thinks of right&shy;eous&shy;ness; who in the view of dan&shy;ger is pre&shy;pared to give up his life; and who does not for&shy;get an old a&shy;gree&shy;ment how&shy;ev&shy;er far back it ex&shy;tends:-- such a man may be reck&shy;oned a COMPLETE man.&#x02BC;

    <sup>14:30</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, &#x02BC;The way of the su&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;or man is three&shy;fold, but I am not e&shy;qual to it.

<p>
    <sup>14:39</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, &#x02BC;Some men of worth re&shy;tire from the world.  Some re&shy;tire from par&shy;tic&shy;u&shy;lar states.

"Deep wa&shy;ter must be crossed with the clothes on;  shal&shy;low wa&shy;ter may be crossed with the clothes held up."&#x02BC; Confucius said, &#x02BC;How de&shy;ter&shy;mined is he in his pur&shy;pose!

    <sup>14:45</sup>&#8239;Tsze-lu asked what con&shy;sti&shy;tut&shy;ed the su&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;or man.

    <sup>15:1</sup>&#8239;The Duke Ling of Wei asked Confucius a&shy;bout tac&shy;tics.

    <sup>15:7</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, &#x02BC;When a man may be spo&shy;ken with, not to speak to him is to err in ref&shy;er&shy;ence to the man.
