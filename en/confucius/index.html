    <p>
    <sup>1:1</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, <q>Isn&#x02BC;t it a pleas&shy;ure to learn some&shy;thing, then to ap&shy;ply it at the right time?  Isn&#x02BC;t it a joy to have friends come from a&shy;far?  Isn&#x02BC;t he a su&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;or man who takes no of&shy;fense when his mer&shy;its are ig&shy;nored?</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>1:2</sup>&#8239;Mas&shy;ter You said, <q>The su&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;or man works on the root, for once the root is es&shy;tab&shy;lished, the Way will grow from it.  Isn&#x02BC;t re&shy;spect for par&shy;ents and el&shy;ders the root of be&shy;nev&shy;o&shy;lence?</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>1:3</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, <q>Cun&shy;ning words and an in&shy;gra&shy;ti&shy;at&shy;ing ap&shy;pear&shy;ance rare&shy;ly ac&shy;com&shy;pa&shy;ny be&shy;nev&shy;o&shy;lence.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>1:4</sup>&#8239;Mas&shy;ter Zeng said, <q>Each day I ex&shy;am&shy;ine my&shy;self on three points. When deal&shy;ing on be&shy;half of oth&shy;ers, have I been loy&shy;al?  In my in&shy;ter&shy;ac&shy;tions with friends, have I been trust&shy;wor&shy;thy?  Have I prac&shy;tised what I was taught?</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>1:5</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, <q>The Way to guide a state of a thou&shy;sand char&shy;i&shy;ots: be at&shy;ten&shy;tive to busi&shy;ness and trust&shy;wor&shy;thy; be fru&shy;gal in ex&shy;pend&shy;i&shy;tures and love your fel&shy;low men; on&shy;ly mo&shy;bi&shy;lize the com&shy;mon peo&shy;ple at the prop&shy;er time of year.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>1:6</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, <q>A young man should re&shy;spect his par&shy;ents at home, re&shy;spect his el&shy;ders a&shy;broad, say lit&shy;tle but be trust&shy;wor&shy;thy, love the peo&shy;ple at large but be in&shy;ti&shy;mate with the be&shy;nev&shy;o&shy;lent. If he still has en&shy;er&shy;gy to spare, let him stud&shy;y lit&shy;er&shy;a&shy;ture.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>1:7</sup>&#8239;Zixia said, <q>Oth&shy;ers may say that a man is un&shy;ed&shy;u&shy;cat&shy;ed, but I call him ed&shy;u&shy;cat&shy;ed if he val&shy;ues vir&shy;tue more than beau&shy;ty, ex&shy;erts his ut&shy;most when serv&shy;ing his par&shy;ents, of&shy;fers his whole per&shy;son when serv&shy;ing his lord, and is trust&shy;wor&shy;thy when speak&shy;ing with friends.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>1:10</sup>&#8239;Ziqin asked Zigong, <q>When our Mas&shy;ter ar&shy;rives in a coun&shy;try, he al&shy;ways learns a&shy;bout its gov&shy;ern&shy;ment.  Does he seek out this in&shy;for&shy;ma&shy;tion or is it giv&shy;en to him?</q>  Zigong replied, <q>Our Mas&shy;ter ob&shy;tains it by be&shy;ing cor&shy;dial, up&shy;right, re&shy;spect&shy;ful, fru&shy;gal, and def&shy;er&shy;en&shy;tial. Our Mas&shy;ter seeks it dif&shy;fer&shy;ent&shy;ly than oth&shy;er men do.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>1:14</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, <q>A su&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;or man seeks nei&shy;ther a full stom&shy;ach nor com&shy;fort&shy;a&shy;ble lodg&shy;ings.  He is dil&shy;i&shy;gent in his ac&shy;tions but cau&shy;tious in his speech.  He as&shy;so&shy;ci&shy;ates with those who know the Way in or&shy;der to be put right.  Such a man may be said to love learn&shy;ing.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>1:15</sup>&#8239;Zigong asked, <q>What do you think of the say&shy;ing, <q>Poor with&shy;out grov&shy;el&shy;ing, rich with&shy;out ar&shy;ro&shy;gance</q>?</q> The Mas&shy;ter replied, <q>Not bad, but bet&shy;ter still, <q>Poor but enjoying the Way, rich but lov&shy;ing pro&shy;pri&shy;e&shy;ty.</q></q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>1:16</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, <q>Don&#x02BC;t wor&shy;ry that men don&#x02BC;t rec&shy;og&shy;nize your mer&shy;its; wor&shy;ry that you don&#x02BC;t rec&shy;og&shy;nize theirs.</q>
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>2:1</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, <q>He who gov&shy;erns by vir&shy;tue is like the North Star: it stays in its place while all the oth&shy;er stars pay hom&shy;age to it.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:3</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, <q>Lead the peo&shy;ple with e&shy;dicts, keep them or&shy;der&shy;ly with pun&shy;ish&shy;ments: they will e&shy;vade the pun&shy;ish&shy;ment and have no sense of shame.  Lead them with vir&shy;tue, keep them or&shy;der&shy;ly with pro&shy;pri&shy;e&shy;ty: they will have a sense of shame and or&shy;der them&shy;selves.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:6</sup>&#8239;Meng Wubo asked a&shy;bout fil&shy;ial pi&shy;e&shy;ty. Confucius said, <q>Give your par&shy;ents noth&shy;ing to wor&shy;ry a&shy;bout oth&shy;er than ill&shy;ness.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:7</sup>&#8239;Ziyou asked a&shy;bout fil&shy;ial pi&shy;e&shy;ty. Confucius said, <q>Now&shy;a&shy;days fil&shy;ial pi&shy;e&shy;ty on&shy;ly means be&shy;ing a&shy;ble to feed your par&shy;ents.  But e&shy;ven dogs and hors&shy;es re&shy;ceive this much care.  With&shy;out re&shy;spect, what&#x02BC;s the dif&shy;fer&shy;ence?</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:8</sup>&#8239;Zixia asked a&shy;bout fil&shy;ial pi&shy;e&shy;ty. Confucius said, <q>It&#x02BC;s the ex&shy;pres&shy;sion on your face that&#x02BC;s dif&shy;fi&shy;cult to man&shy;age.  It&#x02BC;s not fil&shy;ial pi&shy;e&shy;ty mere&shy;ly for the young to shoul&shy;der the bur&shy;den when there is work to do, and to de&shy;fer to their el&shy;ders when there is wine and food a&shy;vail&shy;a&shy;ble.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:10</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, <q>Look at the means a man em&shy;ploys.  Ob&shy;serve his mo&shy;tives. Ex&shy;am&shy;ine what gives him com&shy;fort.  How can a man con&shy;ceal his char&shy;ac&shy;ter?</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:11</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, <q>If a man learns the new by reviewing the old, he is wor&shy;thy to be a teach&shy;er.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:13</sup>&#8239;Zigong asked a&shy;bout the su&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;or man. Confucius said, <q>He acts be&shy;fore he speaks, and then speaks ac&shy;cord&shy;ing to his ac&shy;tions.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:14</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, <q>The su&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;or man is in&shy;clu&shy;sive and not par&shy;ti&shy;san.  The in&shy;fe&shy;ri&shy;or man is par&shy;ti&shy;san and not in&shy;clu&shy;sive.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:15</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, <q>Learn&shy;ing with&shy;out think&shy;ing is a waste.  Think&shy;ing with&shy;out learn&shy;ing is dan&shy;ger&shy;ous.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:17</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, <q>Knowl&shy;edge is to know when you know some&shy;thing, and to know when you don&#x02BC;t.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:18</sup>&#8239;Zizhang was stud&shy;y&shy;ing in or&shy;der to get an of&shy;fi&shy;cial po&shy;si&shy;tion. Confucius said, <q>If you lis&shy;ten much, put a&shy;side what is doubt&shy;ful, and speak cau&shy;tious&shy;ly a&shy;bout the rest, you will make few mis&shy;takes.  If you ob&shy;serve much, put a&shy;side what is per&shy;i&shy;lous, and act cau&shy;tious&shy;ly on the rest, you will have few re&shy;grets.  Few mis&shy;takes in speech, few re&shy;grets in ac&shy;tion: an of&shy;fi&shy;cial po&shy;si&shy;tion will fol&shy;low.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:19</sup>&#8239;Duke A&shy;i asked, <q>What should I do so that the peo&shy;ple fol&shy;low me?</q> Confucius said, <q>If you raise up the straight and place them o&shy;ver the crook&shy;ed, the peo&shy;ple will fol&shy;low you.  If you raise up the crook&shy;ed and place them o&shy;ver the straight, the peo&shy;ple will not fol&shy;low you.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:20</sup>&#8239;Ji Kangzi asked, <q>How can I en&shy;cour&shy;age the peo&shy;ple to be re&shy;spect&shy;ful, loy&shy;al, and dil&shy;i&shy;gent?</q>  Confucius said, <q>Ap&shy;proach them with dig&shy;ni&shy;ty then they will be re&shy;spect&shy;ful.  Be fil&shy;ial and kind then they will be loy&shy;al.  Raise up the good and in&shy;struct the in&shy;com&shy;pe&shy;tent then they will be dil&shy;i&shy;gent.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:21</sup>&#8239;Some&shy;one asked Confucius, <q>Why don&#x02BC;t you en&shy;gage in gov&shy;ern&shy;ment?</q> Confucius said, <q>The Book of Doc&shy;u&shy;ments says, <q>Just by be&shy;ing fil&shy;ial and be&shy;ing friend&shy;ly to your broth&shy;ers you will have an ef&shy;fect on gov&shy;ern&shy;ment.</q>  Since this is al&shy;so en&shy;gag&shy;ing in gov&shy;ern&shy;ment, why do I need to <q>en&shy;gage in gov&shy;ern&shy;ment</q>?</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:22</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, <q>I don&#x02BC;t know what to do with an un&shy;trust&shy;wor&shy;thy man. How can you pull a wag&shy;on that&#x02BC;s mis&shy;sing its yoke pin?</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:24</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, <q>To sac&shy;ri&shy;fice to an&shy;ces&shy;tral spir&shy;its oth&shy;er than your own is flat&shy;ter&shy;y.  To see what is right and not to do it is a lack of cour&shy;age.</q>
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>3:3</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, <q>If a man is not be&shy;nev&shy;o&shy;lent, what can he do with pro&shy;pri&shy;e&shy;ty?</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>3:4</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, <q>In rit&shy;u&shy;al, pre&shy;fer fru&shy;gal&shy;i&shy;ty to ex&shy;trav&shy;a&shy;gance.  In fu&shy;ner&shy;als, pre&shy;fer grief to for&shy;mal&shy;i&shy;ty.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>3:7</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, <q>A su&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;or man is not com&shy;pet&shy;i&shy;tive. If he must com&shy;pete, let it be at ar&shy;cher&shy;y.  He as&shy;cends to his po&shy;si&shy;tion and bows in def&shy;er&shy;ence.  Af&shy;ter&shy;wards, he de&shy;scends and drinks a sa&shy;lute.  E&shy;ven in com&shy;pe&shy;ti&shy;tion he is a su&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;or man.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>3:12</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, <q>If I don&#x02BC;t par&shy;tic&shy;i&shy;pate in a sac&shy;ri&shy;fice, it&#x02BC;s as if I have not sacrificed at all.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>3:15</sup>&#8239;When Confucius en&shy;tered the Grand Tem&shy;ple, he asked ques&shy;tions a&shy;bout eve&shy;ry&shy;thing. Some&shy;one re&shy;marked, <q>Who says that Confucius knows a&shy;bout rit&shy;u&shy;al? When visiting the Grand Tem&shy;ple, he asked ques&shy;tions a&shy;bout eve&shy;ry&shy;thing.</q> Confucius, hear&shy;ing this, said, <q>This is the rit&shy;u&shy;al.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>3:21</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, <q>Don&#x02BC;t ex&shy;plain a&shy;way what is al&shy;read&shy;y done.  Don&#x02BC;t ar&shy;gue a&shy;gainst what is al&shy;read&shy;y ac&shy;com&shy;plished.  Don&#x02BC;t as&shy;sign blame for what is al&shy;read&shy;y past.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>3:26</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, <q>Hold&shy;ing a high po&shy;si&shy;tion with&shy;out tol&shy;er&shy;ance, per&shy;form&shy;ing rit&shy;u&shy;al with&shy;out rev&shy;er&shy;ence, joining a fu&shy;ner&shy;al with&shy;out grief: how can I look at such things?</q>
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>4:1</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, <q>It is be&shy;nev&shy;o&shy;lence that makes a neigh&shy;bor&shy;hood beau&shy;ti&shy;ful. How can a man be con&shy;sid&shy;ered wise if he chooses not to re&shy;side a&shy;mong be&shy;nev&shy;o&shy;lence?</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>4:2</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, <q>Those who lack be&shy;nev&shy;o&shy;lence can en&shy;dure nei&shy;ther ad&shy;ver&shy;si&shy;ty nor en&shy;joy&shy;ment for long. The be&shy;nev&shy;o&shy;lent are con&shy;tent with be&shy;nev&shy;o&shy;lence. The wise cul&shy;ti&shy;vate be&shy;nev&shy;o&shy;lence for its ad&shy;van&shy;tage.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>4:4</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, <q>If you set your heart on be&shy;nev&shy;o&shy;lence, you will be free from evil.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>4:5</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, <q>All men de&shy;sire wealth and hon&shy;or, but if they are ob&shy;tained by not fol&shy;low&shy;ing the Way, they should not be kept. All men hate pov&shy;er&shy;ty and dis&shy;grace, but if they can&#x02BC;t be a&shy;voided by fol&shy;low&shy;ing the Way, they should not be a&shy;voided.  If a su&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;or man a&shy;ban&shy;dons be&shy;nev&shy;o&shy;lence, how is he wor&shy;thy of that name?  A su&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;or man nev&shy;er leaves be&shy;nev&shy;o&shy;lence e&shy;ven for the space of a sin&shy;gle meal.  In mo&shy;ments of haste, he acts ac&shy;cord&shy;ing to it.  In times of dif&shy;fi&shy;cul&shy;ty, he acts ac&shy;cord&shy;ing to it.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>4:6</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, <q>One who re&shy;al&shy;ly loves be&shy;nev&shy;o&shy;lence puts noth&shy;ing a&shy;bove it. One who re&shy;al&shy;ly hates what is not be&shy;nev&shy;o&shy;lent would not al&shy;low it to ap&shy;proach him.  Has any&shy;one de&shy;vot&shy;ed all his strength to be&shy;nev&shy;o&shy;lence for a sin&shy;gle day?  I hav&shy;en&#x02BC;t seen any&shy;one who lacked the strength to do so.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>4:7</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, <q>Peo&shy;ple make er&shy;rors ac&shy;cord&shy;ing to the type of per&shy;son they are.  Ob&shy;serve their er&shy;rors and you can know their de&shy;gree of be&shy;nev&shy;o&shy;lence.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>4:9</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, <q>A gen&shy;tle&shy;man who sets his heart on the Way, but is a&shy;shamed of poor clothes and poor food, is not worth en&shy;gag&shy;ing in dis&shy;cus&shy;sion.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>4:10</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, <q>When a su&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;or man deals with the world he is not in&shy;var&shy;i&shy;a&shy;bly for or a&shy;gainst any&shy;thing.  He sides with what is right.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>4:11</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, <q>A su&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;or man cherishes vir&shy;tue; an in&shy;fe&shy;ri&shy;or man cherishes land.  A su&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;or man cherishes jus&shy;tice; an in&shy;fe&shy;ri&shy;or man cherishes fa&shy;vors.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>4:12</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, <q>One who acts out of per&shy;son&shy;al prof&shy;it in&shy;curs much re&shy;sent&shy;ment.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>4:14</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, <q>Don&#x02BC;t wor&shy;ry that you have no po&shy;si&shy;tion; wor&shy;ry a&shy;bout what it takes to mer&shy;it one.  Don&#x02BC;t wor&shy;ry that no one knows you; seek to be worth know&shy;ing.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>4:16</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, <q>A su&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;or man un&shy;der&shy;stands what is right.  An in&shy;fe&shy;ri&shy;or man un&shy;der&shy;stands per&shy;son&shy;al prof&shy;it.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>4:17</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, <q>When you see a wor&shy;thy man, think of be&shy;com&shy;ing his e&shy;qual; when you see an un&shy;wor&shy;thy man, look with&shy;in and ex&shy;am&shy;ine your&shy;self.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>4:18</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, <q>In serv&shy;ing your par&shy;ents, you may ad&shy;mon&shy;ish them gen&shy;tly; if you see that they don&#x02BC;t fol&shy;low your ad&shy;vice, re&shy;main re&shy;spect&shy;ful, don&#x02BC;t be&shy;come dis&shy;o&shy;be&shy;di&shy;ent, and work with&shy;out complaining.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>4:22</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, <q>The an&shy;cients were re&shy;luc&shy;tant to speak, be&shy;cause they would be a&shy;shamed if their ac&shy;tions did not live up to their words.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>4:23</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, <q>One rare&shy;ly miss&shy;es the mark be&shy;cause of self-control.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>4:24</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, <q>A su&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;or man wants to be slow in speech but quick in ac&shy;tion.</q>

<p>
    <sup>4:25</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, <q>Vir&shy;tue is nev&shy;er a&shy;lone. It al&shy;ways has neigh&shy;bors.</q>
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>5:5</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, <q>What is the use of el&shy;o&shy;quence?  Those who give a quick re&shy;tort of&shy;ten in&shy;cur the ha&shy;tred of oth&shy;ers.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>5:10</sup>&#8239;Zai Yu was sleep&shy;ing dur&shy;ing the day. Confucius said, <q>Rot&shy;ten wood can&shy;not be carved, and a wall of ma&shy;nure can&shy;not be trow&shy;elled. What is the use of scolding Zai Yu?  I used to lis&shy;ten to what peo&shy;ple said and trust them to act ac&shy;cord&shy;ing&shy;ly.  Now I lis&shy;ten to what peo&shy;ple say and watch what they do.  It is be&shy;cause of Zai Yu that I have changed.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>5:11</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, <q>I hav&shy;en&#x02BC;t seen a tru&shy;ly stead&shy;fast man. How can a man who is full of de&shy;sires be stead&shy;fast?</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>5:15</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, <q>Kong the Re&shy;fined was men&shy;tal&shy;ly quick, fond of learn&shy;ing, and not a&shy;shamed to ask ques&shy;tions of his in&shy;fe&shy;ri&shy;ors. That is why he was giv&shy;en the post&shy;hu&shy;mous ti&shy;tle of <q>Re&shy;fined</q>.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>5:16</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, <q>Zi Chan had four char&shy;ac&shy;ter&shy;is&shy;tics of the Way of a su&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;or man: he was re&shy;spect&shy;ful in his pri&shy;vate con&shy;duct, re&shy;spect&shy;ful in serv&shy;ing his su&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;ors, gen&shy;er&shy;ous in car&shy;ing for the peo&shy;ple, and just in employing the peo&shy;ple.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>5:17</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, <q>Yang Ping Zhong ex&shy;celled in his re&shy;la&shy;tions with oth&shy;ers. E&shy;ven af&shy;ter long ac&shy;quaint&shy;ance he con&shy;tin&shy;ued to treat them with re&shy;spect.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>5:20</sup>&#8239;Ji Wen Zi al&shy;ways thought three times be&shy;fore act&shy;ing.  Hear&shy;ing this, Confucius said, <q>Twice is e&shy;nough.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>5:23</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, <q>Bo Yi and Shu Qi did not re&shy;mem&shy;ber old griev&shy;ances, so there was lit&shy;tle re&shy;sent&shy;ment a&shy;gainst them.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>5:25</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, <q>Glib talk, an in&shy;gra&shy;ti&shy;at&shy;ing ex&shy;pres&shy;sion, and ob&shy;se&shy;qui&shy;ous con&shy;duct: I am a&shy;shamed of such be&shy;hav&shy;ior.

</p>

<p>
    <sup>5:26</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, <q>My heart&#x02BC;s de&shy;sire is to bring peace to the old, to share trust with my friends, and to cher&shy;ish the young.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>5:27</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, <q>I have not yet met any&shy;one who can see his own faults and in&shy;ward&shy;ly ac&shy;cuse him&shy;self.</q>
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>6:3</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, <q>Yanhui loved learn&shy;ing. He nev&shy;er took his an&shy;ger out on oth&shy;ers, and nev&shy;er made the same mis&shy;take twice.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>6:11</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, <q>How ad&shy;mi&shy;ra&shy;ble Yanhui was!  He lived on a bowlful of rice to eat, a la&shy;dle&shy;ful of wa&shy;ter to drink, and a hov&shy;el for shel&shy;ter.  Oth&shy;ers could not have en&shy;dured such mis&shy;er&shy;y, yet Yanhui&#x02BC;s joy was un&shy;changed.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>6:12</sup>&#8239;Ran Qiu said, <q>It is not that I don&#x02BC;t en&shy;joy your Way, but I don&#x02BC;t have the strength to fol&shy;low it.</q>  Confucius said, <q>Those who don&#x02BC;t have the strength col&shy;lapse a&shy;long the way, but you have drawn a line be&shy;fore starting.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>6:14</sup>&#8239;Confucius asked Zi You, <q>Have you been a&shy;ble to em&shy;ploy any good peo&shy;ple?</q>  Zi You an&shy;swered, <q>There is Dantai Mieming. He nev&shy;er takes short&shy;cuts, and has nev&shy;er come to my home ex&shy;cept on of&shy;fi&shy;cial busi&shy;ness.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>6:15</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, <q>Meng Zhifan was not boast&shy;ful.  He once held the rear dur&shy;ing a re&shy;treat.  As they reached the cit&shy;y gate, he whipped his horse, say&shy;ing, <q>It&#x02BC;s not that I dared to be last, on&shy;ly that my horse wouldn&#x02BC;t go.</q></q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>6:18</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, <q>When nat&shy;u&shy;ral dis&shy;po&shy;si&shy;tion pre&shy;vails o&shy;ver re&shy;fine&shy;ment, you get a sav&shy;age.  When re&shy;fine&shy;ment pre&shy;vails o&shy;ver nat&shy;u&shy;ral dis&shy;po&shy;si&shy;tion, you get a pe&shy;dan&shy;tic clerk. When nat&shy;u&shy;ral dis&shy;po&shy;si&shy;tion and re&shy;fine&shy;ment are prop&shy;er&shy;ly blend&shy;ed, you get a su&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;or man.</q>
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>7:2</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, <q>It&#x02BC;s nat&shy;u&shy;ral for me to store up knowl&shy;edge si&shy;lent&shy;ly, to learn with&shy;out sa&shy;ti&shy;e&shy;ty, and to teach oth&shy;ers with&shy;out wea&shy;ri&shy;ness.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>7:3</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, <q>My worries are fail&shy;ure to cul&shy;ti&shy;vate vir&shy;tue, fail&shy;ure to ex&shy;plore what I learn, in&shy;a&shy;bil&shy;i&shy;ty to fol&shy;low what is right when I hear it, and in&shy;a&shy;bil&shy;i&shy;ty to change what is not good.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>7:6</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, <q>Set your heart on the Way.  Base your&shy;self in vir&shy;tue. Re&shy;ly on be&shy;nev&shy;o&shy;lence.  En&shy;joy the arts.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>7:7</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, <q>I have nev&shy;er de&shy;nied in&shy;struc&shy;tion to any&shy;one, e&shy;ven if his own re&shy;sources could on&shy;ly af&shy;ford a bun&shy;dle of dried meat for tu&shy;i&shy;tion.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>7:8</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, <q>I on&shy;ly en&shy;light&shy;en those who are driv&shy;en by ea&shy;ger&shy;ness to learn and who are anx&shy;ious&shy;ly try&shy;ing to ex&shy;plain their i&shy;de&shy;as.  If I lift up one cor&shy;ner and they can&shy;not come back with the oth&shy;er three, I don&#x02BC;t re&shy;peat my&shy;self.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>7:9</sup>&#8239;When Confucius was eat&shy;ing in the pres&shy;ence of a mourn&shy;er, he nev&shy;er ate his fill.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>7:11</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, <q>Few have the a&shy;bil&shy;i&shy;ty to act when em&shy;ployed and to hide when dis&shy;missed. If I were com&shy;mand&shy;ing the Three Armies, who would I take with me? A man who would wres&shy;tle a ti&shy;ger with bare hands or cross a riv&shy;er on foot, dy&shy;ing with&shy;out re&shy;gret&mdash;I would not take that man.  It must be some&shy;one who approaches a task with ap&shy;pre&shy;hen&shy;sion, likes to make plans, and can ex&shy;e&shy;cute them suc&shy;cess&shy;ful&shy;ly.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>7:12</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, <q>If wealth can be sought de&shy;cent&shy;ly, I will do so, e&shy;ven if I have to have a low&shy;ly job. If it can&shy;not be sought de&shy;cent&shy;ly, I will fol&shy;low what I love.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>7:15</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, <q>Bo Yi and Shu Qi sought be&shy;nev&shy;o&shy;lence and got it.  Why should they have com&shy;plaints?</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>7:16</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, <q>Coarse rice to eat, wa&shy;ter to drink, and your bent arm for a pil&shy;low&mdash;there is still joy in the midst of these things. Wealth and hon&shy;or ob&shy;tained by un&shy;right&shy;eous means are like fleet&shy;ing clouds to me.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>7:17</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, <q>Give me a few more years; if I can stud&shy;y un&shy;til fif&shy;ty, I may be free from great mis&shy;takes.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>7:19</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, <q>I&#x02BC;m the kind of man who is so ea&shy;ger for knowl&shy;edge that he for&shy;gets to eat, who is so joy&shy;ful that he for&shy;gets to wor&shy;ry, and who is not a&shy;ware that old age is com&shy;ing.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>7:20</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, <q>I was not born with knowl&shy;edge, but I love an&shy;tiq&shy;ui&shy;ty and ear&shy;nest&shy;ly seek it.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>7:21</sup>&#8239;Confucius nev&shy;er dis&shy;cussed strange phe&shy;nom&shy;e&shy;na, feats of strength, dis&shy;or&shy;der, or the spir&shy;its.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>7:22</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, <q>When walk&shy;ing with any two peo&shy;ple, they must have some&shy;thing to teach me. I se&shy;lect their strengths and fol&shy;low them, their weaknesses and cor&shy;rect my&shy;self.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>7:24</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, <q>My friends, I hide noth&shy;ing from you.  What&shy;ev&shy;er I do, I share with you. That is who I am.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>7:25</sup>&#8239;Confucius taught in four categories: lit&shy;er&shy;a&shy;ture, con&shy;duct, loy&shy;al&shy;ty, and faith&shy;ful&shy;ness.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>7:26</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, <q>I can&#x02BC;t hope to meet a sage, but I would be con&shy;tent to meet a su&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;or man.  I can&#x02BC;t hope to meet a tru&shy;ly good man, but I would be con&shy;tent to meet a stead&shy;fast man.  It is hard to be stead&shy;fast when noth&shy;ing pre&shy;tends to be some&shy;thing, emp&shy;ti&shy;ness pre&shy;tends to be full&shy;ness, and pov&shy;er&shy;ty pre&shy;tends to be com&shy;fort.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>7:27</sup>&#8239;Confucius fished with a line, but didn&#x02BC;t use a net.  He hunt&shy;ed, but didn&#x02BC;t shoot roosting birds.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>7:28</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, <q>There may be those who can act with&shy;out knowl&shy;edge, but I am not one of them.  I hear much, se&shy;lect what is good, and fol&shy;low it.  I see much, and re&shy;mem&shy;ber it.  This is the sec&shy;ond lev&shy;el of knowl&shy;edge.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>7:29</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, <q>To ap&shy;prove of a man&#x02BC;s vis&shy;it does not mean ap&shy;prov&shy;ing of what he does af&shy;ter he leaves.  Why be so se&shy;vere?  When a man purifies him&shy;self to ap&shy;proach me, I ap&shy;prove of his pu&shy;ri&shy;ty with&shy;out en&shy;dors&shy;ing his past or his fu&shy;ture.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>7:30</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, <q>Is be&shy;nev&shy;o&shy;lence far a&shy;way? As soon as I want be&shy;nev&shy;o&shy;lence, it is at hand.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>7:31</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, <q>I am for&shy;tu&shy;nate.  When I make a mis&shy;take, oth&shy;ers al&shy;ways no&shy;tice it.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>7:34</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, <q>How would I dare claim to be be&shy;nev&shy;o&shy;lent or a sage? Rath&shy;er, it may be said that I strive for them with&shy;out flag&shy;ging, and teach oth&shy;ers with&shy;out wea&shy;ri&shy;ness.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>7:36</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, <q>Ex&shy;trav&shy;a&shy;gance leads to ar&shy;ro&shy;gance; fru&shy;gal&shy;i&shy;ty leads to stin&shy;gi&shy;ness. It&#x02BC;s bet&shy;ter to be sting&shy;y than ar&shy;ro&shy;gant.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>7:37</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, <q>A su&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;or man is eas&shy;y&shy;go&shy;ing and un&shy;per&shy;turbed. An in&shy;fe&shy;ri&shy;or man is al&shy;ways tense and anx&shy;ious.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>7:38</sup>&#8239;Confucius was warm yet stern; au&shy;thor&shy;i&shy;ta&shy;tive but not fierce; re&shy;spect&shy;ful yet at ease.
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>8:1</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, <q>Tai Bo can be said to have had the highest vir&shy;tue. Three times he de&shy;clined his claim to the king&shy;dom.  The peo&shy;ple could not find words ad&shy;e&shy;quate to praise him.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>8:2</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, <q>Cour&shy;te&shy;sy with&shy;out pro&shy;pri&shy;e&shy;ty is tire&shy;some.  Cau&shy;tion with&shy;out pro&shy;pri&shy;e&shy;ty is ti&shy;mid&shy;i&shy;ty.  Brav&shy;er&shy;y with&shy;out pro&shy;pri&shy;e&shy;ty is cha&shy;os.  Can&shy;dor with&shy;out pro&shy;pri&shy;e&shy;ty is rude&shy;ness.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>8:9</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, <q>The peo&shy;ple can be made to fol&shy;low a path, but they can&#x02BC;t be made to un&shy;der&shy;stand it.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>8:10</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, <q>A man who loves brav&shy;er&shy;y and hates pov&shy;er&shy;ty will pro&shy;ceed to un&shy;ru&shy;ly be&shy;hav&shy;ior.  A man with&shy;out be&shy;nev&shy;o&shy;lence who is de&shy;spised by oth&shy;ers too much will pro&shy;ceed to un&shy;ru&shy;ly be&shy;hav&shy;ior.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>8:11</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, <q>If a man had tal&shy;ents as ad&shy;mi&shy;ra&shy;ble as the Duke of Zhou, but was ar&shy;ro&shy;gant and sting&shy;y, the rest would not be worth no&shy;tic&shy;ing.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>8:13</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, <q>Have sin&shy;cere faith, love learn&shy;ing, and de&shy;fend the good Way un&shy;to death.  Don&#x02BC;t en&shy;ter a state that is in per&shy;il, and don&#x02BC;t stay in one that is in cha&shy;os.  Show your&shy;self when the Way pre&shy;vails in the world, but hide when it does not.  When the Way pre&shy;vails in the state, it is shame&shy;ful to be poor and hum&shy;ble.  When the Way does not pre&shy;vail in the state, it is shame&shy;ful to be rich and no&shy;ble.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>8:14</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, <q>Don&#x02BC;t plan the policies of a po&shy;si&shy;tion that you don&#x02BC;t hold.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>8:21</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, <q>I can find no fault in Yu.  His food and drink were fru&shy;gal, yet his of&shy;fer&shy;ings to the spir&shy;its and gods showed ut&shy;ter de&shy;vo&shy;tion.  His clothes were coarse, yet his rit&shy;u&shy;al cap and robes were mag&shy;nif&shy;i&shy;cent.  His dwell&shy;ing was hum&shy;ble, yet he ex&shy;hausted his strength on ir&shy;ri&shy;ga&shy;tion ditches and ca&shy;nals.</q>
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>9:3</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, <q>The rules of rit&shy;u&shy;al pre&shy;scribe a hemp cap. Now&shy;a&shy;days it is made of silk.  That is more fru&shy;gal.  I fol&shy;low the com&shy;mon prac&shy;tice.  The rules of rit&shy;u&shy;al pre&shy;scribe bow&shy;ing be&shy;low the steps.  Now&shy;a&shy;days peo&shy;ple bow af&shy;ter as&shy;cend&shy;ing.  That is ar&shy;ro&shy;gant.  Al&shy;though it goes a&shy;gainst the com&shy;mon prac&shy;tice, I bow be&shy;low the steps.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>9:4</sup>&#8239;Confucius for&shy;bade four things: don&#x02BC;t act on spec&shy;u&shy;la&shy;tion, don&#x02BC;t de&shy;mand cer&shy;tain&shy;ty, don&#x02BC;t be stub&shy;born, and don&#x02BC;t be e&shy;go&shy;tis&shy;ti&shy;cal.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>9:6</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, <q>I was poor when I was young, so I learn&shy;ed man&shy;y me&shy;ni&shy;al skills.  Must a su&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;or man be skilled in man&shy;y things? No, not man&shy;y.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>9:8</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, <q>Do I have knowl&shy;edge? No, I do not.  A rus&shy;tic asked me a ques&shy;tion and my mind went blank.  I ham&shy;mered at both ends of the ques&shy;tion un&shy;til I got eve&shy;ry&shy;thing out of it.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>9:13</sup>&#8239;Zi Gong asked, <q>If you had a beau&shy;ti&shy;ful piece of jade here, would you hide it safe&shy;ly in a box or try to get a good price and sell it?</q> Confucius said, <q>Sell it! Sell it!  All I am waiting for is the right of&shy;fer.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>9:16</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, <q>I have no dif&shy;fi&shy;cul&shy;ty serv&shy;ing high of&shy;fi&shy;cials when a&shy;broad, serv&shy;ing my el&shy;ders at home, giv&shy;ing my best ef&shy;forts in fu&shy;ner&shy;al ar&shy;range&shy;ments, and avoiding trou&shy;ble from wine.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>9:18</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, <q>I have nev&shy;er seen a man who loves vir&shy;tue as much as he loves beau&shy;ty in wom&shy;en.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>9:19</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, <q>It&#x02BC;s like build&shy;ing a mound: if I stop be&shy;fore the last bas&shy;ket of earth, it re&shy;mains un&shy;fin&shy;ished.  It&#x02BC;s like fill&shy;ing a ditch: al&shy;though I&#x02BC;ve dumped in on&shy;ly a sin&shy;gle bas&shy;ket of earth, if I con&shy;tin&shy;ue then I&#x02BC;m mak&shy;ing prog&shy;ress.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>9:23</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, <q>The young&shy;er gen&shy;er&shy;a&shy;tion should be held in awe.  How do we know that it will not e&shy;qual the pres&shy;ent one?  But if a man reaches for&shy;ty or fif&shy;ty years old with&shy;out dis&shy;tin&shy;guish&shy;ing him&shy;self, he no long&shy;er de&shy;serves awe.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>9:24</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, <q>I can do noth&shy;ing with the man who en&shy;joys po&shy;lite words with&shy;out unfolding their pur&shy;pose, or who a&shy;grees with ex&shy;em&shy;pla&shy;ry words with&shy;out reforming him&shy;self.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>9:25</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, <q>Put loy&shy;al&shy;ty and trust&shy;wor&shy;thi&shy;ness a&shy;bove eve&shy;ry&shy;thing else. On&shy;ly have friends who are your mor&shy;al e&shy;quals.  When you make a mis&shy;take, don&#x02BC;t be a&shy;fraid to cor&shy;rect it.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>9:29</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, <q>The wise are not con&shy;fused.  The be&shy;nev&shy;o&shy;lent are not anx&shy;ious.  The brave are not a&shy;fraid.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>9:30</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, <q>You may be a&shy;ble to stud&shy;y to&shy;geth&shy;er, and yet be un&shy;a&shy;ble to pur&shy;sue the Way to&shy;geth&shy;er.  You may be a&shy;ble to pur&shy;sue the Way to&shy;geth&shy;er, and yet be un&shy;a&shy;ble to take a stand to&shy;geth&shy;er.  You may be a&shy;ble to take a stand to&shy;geth&shy;er, and yet be un&shy;a&shy;ble to share au&shy;thor&shy;i&shy;ty to&shy;geth&shy;er.</q>

<p>
    <sup>10:1</sup>&#8239;In his vil&shy;lage, Confucius was most def&shy;er&shy;en&shy;tial, as if he were un&shy;a&shy;ble to speak.  In the an&shy;ces&shy;tral tem&shy;ple or at court, he was el&shy;o&shy;quent but cau&shy;tious.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>10:8</sup>&#8239;E&shy;ven if there was plen&shy;ty of meat, he would not eat more meat than rice.  On&shy;ly with wine did he have no set lim&shy;it, but he nev&shy;er drank to the point of con&shy;fu&shy;sion.

    <sup>15:4</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, &#x02BC;May not Shun be in&shy;stanced as hav&shy;ing gov&shy;erned ef&shy;fi&shy;cient&shy;ly with&shy;out ex&shy;er&shy;tion? What did he do? He did noth&shy;ing but grave&shy;ly and reverently oc&shy;cu&shy;py his roy&shy;al seat.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>15:5</sup>&#8239;Tsze-chang asked how a man should con&shy;duct him&shy;self, so as to be eve&shy;ry&shy;where ap&shy;pre&shy;ci&shy;at&shy;ed.  Confucius said, &#x02BC;Let his words be sin&shy;cere and truth&shy;ful, and his ac&shy;tions honourable and care&shy;ful;-- such con&shy;duct may be prac&shy;tised a&shy;mong the rude tribes of the South or the North. If his words be not sin&shy;cere and truth&shy;ful and his ac&shy;tions not honourable and care&shy;ful, will he, with such con&shy;duct, be ap&shy;pre&shy;ci&shy;at&shy;ed, e&shy;ven in his neigh&shy;bor&shy;hood?  &#x02BC;When he is stand&shy;ing, let him see those two things, as it were, fronting him. When he is in a car&shy;riage, let him see them at&shy;tached to the yoke. Then may he sub&shy;se&shy;quent&shy;ly car&shy;ry them in&shy;to prac&shy;tice.&#x02BC; Tsze-chang wrote these coun&shy;sels on the end of his sash.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>15:6</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, &#x02BC;Truly straight&shy;for&shy;ward was the his&shy;to&shy;ri&shy;og&shy;ra&shy;pher Yu. When good gov&shy;ern&shy;ment pre&shy;vailed in his State, he was like an ar&shy;row. When bad gov&shy;ern&shy;ment pre&shy;vailed, he was like an ar&shy;row.  A su&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;or man in&shy;deed is Chu Po-yu! When good gov&shy;ern&shy;ment pre&shy;vails in his state, he is to be found in of&shy;fice. When bad gov&shy;ern&shy;ment pre&shy;vails, he can roll his prin&shy;ci&shy;ples up, and keep them in his breast.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>15:7</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, &#x02BC;When a man may be spo&shy;ken with, not to speak to him is to err in ref&shy;er&shy;ence to the man. When a man may not be spo&shy;ken with, to speak to him is to err in ref&shy;er&shy;ence to our words. The wise err nei&shy;ther in re&shy;gard to their man nor to their words.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>15:8</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, &#x02BC;The de&shy;ter&shy;mined schol&shy;ar and the man of vir&shy;tue will not seek to live at the ex&shy;pense of in&shy;jur&shy;ing their vir&shy;tue. They will e&shy;ven sac&shy;ri&shy;fice their lives to pre&shy;serve their vir&shy;tue com&shy;plete.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>15:9</sup>&#8239;Tsze-kung asked a&shy;bout the prac&shy;tice of vir&shy;tue. Confucius said, &#x02BC;The me&shy;chan&shy;ic, who wishes to do his work well, must first sharp&shy;en his tools. When you are liv&shy;ing in any state, take serv&shy;ice with the most wor&shy;thy a&shy;mong its great of&shy;fic&shy;ers, and make friends of the most vir&shy;tu&shy;ous a&shy;mong its schol&shy;ars.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>15:10</sup>&#8239;&#x02BC;Let the mu&shy;sic be the Shao with its pan&shy;to&shy;mimes.  Ban&shy;ish the songs of Chang, and keep far from spe&shy;cious talk&shy;ers. The songs of Chang are li&shy;cen&shy;tious; spe&shy;cious talk&shy;ers are dan&shy;ger&shy;ous.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>15:11</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, &#x02BC;If a man take no thought a&shy;bout what is dis&shy;tant, he will find sor&shy;row near at hand.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>15:14</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, &#x02BC;He who re&shy;quires much from him&shy;self and lit&shy;tle from oth&shy;ers, will keep him&shy;self from be&shy;ing the ob&shy;ject of re&shy;sent&shy;ment.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>15:15</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, &#x02BC;When a man is not in the hab&shy;it of say&shy;ing-- "What shall I think of this? What shall I think of this?" I can in&shy;deed do noth&shy;ing with him!&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>15:16</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, &#x02BC;When a num&shy;ber of peo&shy;ple are to&shy;geth&shy;er, for a whole day, with&shy;out their con&shy;ver&shy;sa&shy;tion turn&shy;ing on right&shy;eous&shy;ness, and when they are fond of car&shy;ry&shy;ing out the sug&shy;ges&shy;tions of a small shrewd&shy;ness;-- theirs is in&shy;deed a hard case.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>15:17</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, &#x02BC;The su&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;or man in eve&shy;ry&shy;thing con&shy;sid&shy;ers right&shy;eous&shy;ness to be es&shy;sen&shy;tial. He per&shy;forms it ac&shy;cord&shy;ing to the rules of pro&shy;pri&shy;e&shy;ty. He brings it forth in hu&shy;mil&shy;i&shy;ty. He com&shy;pletes it with sin&shy;cer&shy;i&shy;ty. This is in&shy;deed a su&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;or man.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>15:18</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, &#x02BC;The su&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;or man is dis&shy;tressed by his want of a&shy;bil&shy;i&shy;ty. He is not dis&shy;tressed by men&#x02BC;s not know&shy;ing him.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>15:19</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, &#x02BC;The su&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;or man dis&shy;likes the thought of his name not be&shy;ing men&shy;tioned af&shy;ter his death.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>15:20</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, &#x02BC;What the su&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;or man seeks, is in him&shy;self. What the mean man seeks, is in oth&shy;ers.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>15:21</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, &#x02BC;The su&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;or man is dig&shy;ni&shy;fied, but does not wran&shy;gle. He is so&shy;cia&shy;ble, but not a par&shy;ti&shy;zan.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>15:22</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, &#x02BC;The su&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;or man does not pro&shy;mote a man simp&shy;ly on ac&shy;count of his words, nor does he put a&shy;side good words be&shy;cause of the man.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>15:23</sup>&#8239;Tsze-kung asked, say&shy;ing, &#x02BC;Is there one word which may serve as a rule of prac&shy;tice for all one&#x02BC;s life?&#x02BC; Confucius said, &#x02BC;Is not RECIPROCITY such a word? What you do not want done to your&shy;self, do not do to oth&shy;ers.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>15:25</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, &#x02BC;Even in my ear&shy;ly days, a his&shy;to&shy;ri&shy;og&shy;ra&shy;pher would leave a blank in his text, and he who had a horse would lend him to an&shy;oth&shy;er to ride. Now, a&shy;las! there are no such things.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>15:26</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, &#x02BC;Specious words con&shy;found vir&shy;tue. Want of for&shy;bear&shy;ance in small mat&shy;ters con&shy;founds great plans.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>15:27</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, &#x02BC;When the mul&shy;ti&shy;tude hate a man, it is nec&shy;es&shy;sar&shy;y to ex&shy;am&shy;ine in&shy;to the case. When the mul&shy;ti&shy;tude like a man, it is nec&shy;es&shy;sar&shy;y to ex&shy;am&shy;ine in&shy;to the case.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>15:28</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, &#x02BC;A man can en&shy;large the prin&shy;ci&shy;ples which he fol&shy;lows; those prin&shy;ci&shy;ples do not en&shy;large the man.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>15:29</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, &#x02BC;To have faults and not to re&shy;form them,-- this, in&shy;deed, should be pro&shy;nounced hav&shy;ing faults.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>15:30</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, &#x02BC;I have been the whole day with&shy;out eat&shy;ing, and the whole night with&shy;out sleep&shy;ing:-- occupied with think&shy;ing. It was of no use. The bet&shy;ter plan is to learn.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>15:31</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, &#x02BC;The ob&shy;ject of the su&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;or man is truth. Food is not his ob&shy;ject. There is plowing;-- e&shy;ven in that there is some&shy;times want. So with learn&shy;ing;-- e&shy;mol&shy;u&shy;ment may be found in it. The su&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;or man is anx&shy;ious lest he should not get truth; he is not anx&shy;ious lest pov&shy;er&shy;ty should come up&shy;on him.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>15:32</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, &#x02BC;When a man&#x02BC;s knowl&shy;edge is suf&shy;fi&shy;cient to at&shy;tain, and his vir&shy;tue is not suf&shy;fi&shy;cient to en&shy;a&shy;ble him to hold, what&shy;ev&shy;er he may have gained, he will lose a&shy;gain.  &#x02BC;When his knowl&shy;edge is suf&shy;fi&shy;cient to at&shy;tain, and he has vir&shy;tue e&shy;nough to hold fast, if he can&shy;not gov&shy;ern with dig&shy;ni&shy;ty, the peo&shy;ple will not re&shy;spect him.  &#x02BC;When his knowl&shy;edge is suf&shy;fi&shy;cient to at&shy;tain, and he has vir&shy;tue e&shy;nough to hold fast; when he gov&shy;erns al&shy;so with dig&shy;ni&shy;ty, yet if he try to move the peo&shy;ple con&shy;tra&shy;ry to the rules of pro&shy;pri&shy;e&shy;ty:-- full ex&shy;cel&shy;lence is not reached.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>15:33</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, &#x02BC;The su&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;or man can&shy;not be known in lit&shy;tle mat&shy;ters; but he may be in&shy;trusted with great con&shy;cerns. The small man may not be in&shy;trusted with great con&shy;cerns, but he may be known in lit&shy;tle mat&shy;ters.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>15:35</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, &#x02BC;Let eve&shy;ry man con&shy;sid&shy;er vir&shy;tue as what de&shy;volves on him&shy;self. He may not yield the per&shy;for&shy;mance of it e&shy;ven to his teach&shy;er.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>15:36</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, &#x02BC;The su&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;or man is cor&shy;rect&shy;ly firm, and not firm mere&shy;ly.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>15:37</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, &#x02BC;A min&shy;is&shy;ter, in serv&shy;ing his prince, reverently dis&shy;charges his duties, and makes his e&shy;mol&shy;u&shy;ment a sec&shy;ond&shy;ar&shy;y con&shy;sid&shy;er&shy;a&shy;tion.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>15:38</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, &#x02BC;In teach&shy;ing there should be no dis&shy;tinc&shy;tion of clas&shy;ses.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>15:39</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, &#x02BC;Those whose cours&shy;es are dif&shy;fer&shy;ent can&shy;not lay plans for one an&shy;oth&shy;er.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>15:40</sup>&#8239;Confucius said, &#x02BC;In lan&shy;guage it is simp&shy;ly re&shy;quired that it con&shy;vey the mean&shy;ing.&#x02BC;
