    <sup>5:1</sup>&#8239;And Mo&shy;ses called all Israel, and said un&shy;to them, Hear, O Israel, the stat&shy;utes and judg&shy;ments which I speak in your ears this day, that ye may learn them, and keep, and do them.
    <sup>2</sup>&#8239;<span class="small-caps">God</span> our God made a cov&shy;e&shy;nant with us in Horeb. 
    <sup>3</sup>&#8239;<span class="small-caps">God</span> made not this cov&shy;e&shy;nant with our fa&shy;thers, but with us, e&shy;ven us, who are all of us here a&shy;live this day.
    <sup>4</sup>&#8239;<span class="small-caps">God</span> talked with you face to face in the mount out of the midst of the fire,
    <sup>5</sup>&#8239;(I stood be&shy;tween <span class="small-caps">God</span> and you at that time, to shew you the word of <span class="small-caps">God</span>: for ye were a&shy;fraid by rea&shy;son of the fire, and went not up in&shy;to the mount;) say&shy;ing,
</p>

<p>
    <sup>5:6</sup>&#8239;I am <span class="small-caps">God</span> thy God, which brought thee out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bond&shy;age.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>5:7</sup>&#8239;Thou shalt have none oth&shy;er gods be&shy;fore me. 
</p>

<p>
    <sup>5:8</sup>&#8239;Thou shalt not make thee any grav&shy;en im&shy;age, or any like&shy;ness of any thing that is in heav&shy;en a&shy;bove, or that is in the earth be&shy;neath, or that is in the wa&shy;ters be&shy;neath the earth:
    <sup>9</sup>&#8239;Thou shalt not bow down thy&shy;self un&shy;to them, nor serve them: for I <span class="small-caps">God</span> thy God am a jeal&shy;ous God, visiting the in&shy;iq&shy;ui&shy;ty of the fa&shy;thers up&shy;on the chil&shy;dren un&shy;to the third and fourth gen&shy;er&shy;a&shy;tion of them that hate me,
    <sup>10</sup>&#8239;And shewing mer&shy;cy un&shy;to thou&shy;sands of them that love me and keep my com&shy;mand&shy;ments.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>5:11</sup>&#8239;Thou shalt not take the name of <span class="small-caps">God</span> thy God in vain: for <span class="small-caps">God</span> will not hold him guilt&shy;less that taketh his name in vain.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>5:12</sup>&#8239;Keep the sabbath day to sanc&shy;ti&shy;fy it, as <span class="small-caps">God</span> thy God hath com&shy;manded thee.
    <sup>13</sup>&#8239;Six days thou shalt la&shy;bour, and do all thy work:
    <sup>14</sup>&#8239;But the sev&shy;enth day is the sabbath of <span class="small-caps">God</span> thy God: in it thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daugh&shy;ter, nor thy man&shy;serv&shy;ant, nor thy maid&shy;ser&shy;vant, nor thine ox, nor thine ass, nor any of thy cat&shy;tle, nor thy strang&shy;er that is with&shy;in thy gates; that thy man&shy;serv&shy;ant and thy maid&shy;ser&shy;vant may rest as well as thou.
    <sup>15</sup>&#8239;And re&shy;mem&shy;ber that thou wast a serv&shy;ant in the land of Egypt, and that <span class="small-caps">God</span> thy God brought thee out thence through a might&shy;y hand and by a stretched out arm: there&shy;fore <span class="small-caps">God</span> thy God com&shy;manded thee to keep the sabbath day.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>5:16</sup>&#8239;Honour thy fa&shy;ther and thy moth&shy;er, as <span class="small-caps">God</span> thy God hath com&shy;manded thee; that thy days may be pro&shy;longed, and that it may go well with thee, in the land which <span class="small-caps">God</span> thy God giveth thee.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>5:17</sup>&#8239;Thou shalt not kill. 
</p>

<p>
    <sup>5:18</sup>&#8239;Nei&shy;ther shalt thou com&shy;mit a&shy;dul&shy;ter&shy;y. 
</p>

<p>
    <sup>5:19</sup>&#8239;Nei&shy;ther shalt thou steal. 
</p>

<p>
    <sup>5:20</sup>&#8239;Nei&shy;ther shalt thou bear false wit&shy;ness a&shy;gainst thy neigh&shy;bour. 
</p>

<p>
    <sup>5:21</sup>&#8239;Nei&shy;ther shalt thou de&shy;sire thy neigh&shy;bour&#x02BC;s wife, nei&shy;ther shalt thou cov&shy;et thy neigh&shy;bour&#x02BC;s house, his field, or his man&shy;serv&shy;ant, or his maid&shy;ser&shy;vant, his ox, or his ass, or any thing that is thy neigh&shy;bour&#x02BC;s.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>5:22</sup>&#8239;These words <span class="small-caps">God</span> spake un&shy;to all your as&shy;sem&shy;bly in the mount out of the midst of the fire, of the cloud, and of the thick dark&shy;ness, with a great voice: and he added no more. And he wrote them in two ta&shy;bles of stone, and de&shy;liv&shy;ered them un&shy;to me.
    <sup>23</sup>&#8239;And it came to pass, when ye heard the voice out of the midst of the dark&shy;ness, (for the moun&shy;tain did burn with fire,) that ye came near un&shy;to me, e&shy;ven all the heads of your tribes, and your el&shy;ders;
    <sup>24</sup>&#8239;And ye said, Be&shy;hold, <span class="small-caps">God</span> our God hath shewed us his glo&shy;ry and his great&shy;ness, and we have heard his voice out of the midst of the fire: we have seen this day that God doth talk with man, and he liveth.
    <sup>25</sup>&#8239;Now there&shy;fore why should we die? for this great fire will con&shy;sume us: if we hear the voice of <span class="small-caps">God</span> our God any more, then we shall die.
    <sup>26</sup>&#8239;For who is there of all flesh, that hath heard the voice of the liv&shy;ing God speak&shy;ing out of the midst of the fire, as we have, and lived?
    <sup>27</sup>&#8239;Go thou near, and hear all that <span class="small-caps">God</span> our God shall say: and speak thou un&shy;to us all that <span class="small-caps">God</span> our God shall speak un&shy;to thee;  and we will hear it, and do it.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>5:28</sup>&#8239;And <span class="small-caps">God</span> heard the voice of your words, when ye spake un&shy;to me; and <span class="small-caps">God</span> said un&shy;to me, I have heard the voice of the words of this peo&shy;ple, which they have spo&shy;ken un&shy;to thee: they have well said all that they have spo&shy;ken.
    <sup>29</sup>&#8239;O that there were such an heart in them, that they would fear me, and keep all my com&shy;mand&shy;ments al&shy;ways, that it might be well with them, and with their chil&shy;dren for ev&shy;er!
    <sup>30</sup>&#8239;Go say to them, Get you in&shy;to your tents a&shy;gain. 
    <sup>31</sup>&#8239;But as for thee, stand thou here by me, and I will speak un&shy;to thee all the com&shy;mand&shy;ments, and the stat&shy;utes, and the judg&shy;ments, which thou shalt teach them, that they may do them in the land which I give them to pos&shy;sess it.
    <sup>32</sup>&#8239;Ye shall ob&shy;serve to do there&shy;fore as <span class="small-caps">God</span> your God hath com&shy;manded you: ye shall not turn a&shy;side to the right hand or to the left.
    <sup>33</sup>&#8239;Ye shall walk in all the ways which <span class="small-caps">God</span> your God hath com&shy;manded you, that ye may live, and that it may be well with you, and that ye may pro&shy;long your days in the land which ye shall pos&shy;sess.
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>6:1</sup>&#8239;Now these are the com&shy;mand&shy;ments, the stat&shy;utes, and the judg&shy;ments, which <span class="small-caps">God</span> your God com&shy;manded to teach you, that ye might do them in the land whith&shy;er ye go to pos&shy;sess it:
    <sup>2</sup>&#8239;That thou mightest fear <span class="small-caps">God</span> thy God, to keep all his stat&shy;utes and his com&shy;mand&shy;ments, which I com&shy;mand thee, thou, and thy son, and thy son&#x02BC;s son, all the days of thy life; and that thy days may be pro&shy;longed.
    <sup>3</sup>&#8239;Hear there&shy;fore, O Israel, and ob&shy;serve to do it; that it may be well with thee, and that ye may in&shy;crease might&shy;i&shy;ly, as <span class="small-caps">God</span> God of thy fa&shy;thers hath prom&shy;ised thee, in the land that floweth with milk and hon&shy;ey.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>6:4</sup>&#8239;Hear, O Israel: <span class="small-caps">God</span> our God is one <span class="small-caps">God</span>:
    <sup>5</sup>&#8239;And thou shalt love <span class="small-caps">God</span> thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy might.
    <sup>6</sup>&#8239;And these words, which I com&shy;mand thee this day, shall be in thine heart:
    <sup>7</sup>&#8239;And thou shalt teach them dil&shy;i&shy;gent&shy;ly un&shy;to thy chil&shy;dren, and shalt talk of them when thou sittest in thine house, and when thou walkest by the way, and when thou li&shy;est down, and when thou risest up.
    <sup>8</sup>&#8239;And thou shalt bind them for a sign up&shy;on thine hand, and they shall be as front&shy;lets be&shy;tween thine eyes.
    <sup>9</sup>&#8239;And thou shalt write them up&shy;on the posts of thy house, and on thy gates.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>6:10</sup>&#8239;And it shall be, when <span class="small-caps">God</span> thy God shall have brought thee in&shy;to the land which he sware un&shy;to thy fa&shy;thers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give thee great and good&shy;ly cit&shy;ies, which thou buildedst not,
    <sup>11</sup>&#8239;And hous&shy;es full of all good things, which thou filledst not, and wells digged, which thou diggedst not, vine&shy;yards and ol&shy;ive trees, which thou plantedst not; when thou shalt have eat&shy;en and be full;
    <sup>12</sup>&#8239;Then be&shy;ware lest thou for&shy;get <span class="small-caps">God</span>, which brought thee forth out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bond&shy;age.
    <sup>13</sup>&#8239;Thou shalt fear <span class="small-caps">God</span> thy God, and serve him, and shalt swear by his name.
    <sup>14</sup>&#8239;Ye shall not go af&shy;ter oth&shy;er gods, of the gods of the peo&shy;ple which are round a&shy;bout you;
    <sup>15</sup>&#8239;(For <span class="small-caps">God</span> thy God is a jeal&shy;ous God a&shy;mong you) lest the an&shy;ger of <span class="small-caps">God</span> thy God be kindled a&shy;gainst thee, and de&shy;stroy thee from off the face of the earth.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>6:16</sup>&#8239;Ye shall not tempt <span class="small-caps">God</span> your God, as ye tempted him in Massah.
    <sup>17</sup>&#8239;Ye shall dil&shy;i&shy;gent&shy;ly keep the com&shy;mand&shy;ments of <span class="small-caps">God</span> your God, and his testimonies, and his stat&shy;utes, which he hath com&shy;manded thee.
    <sup>18</sup>&#8239;And thou shalt do that which is right and good in the sight of <span class="small-caps">God</span>: that it may be well with thee, and that thou may&shy;est go in and pos&shy;sess the good land which <span class="small-caps">God</span> sware un&shy;to thy fa&shy;thers.
    <sup>19</sup>&#8239;To cast out all thine enemies from be&shy;fore thee, as <span class="small-caps">God</span> hath spo&shy;ken.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>6:20</sup>&#8239;And when thy son asketh thee in time to come, say&shy;ing, What mean the testimonies, and the stat&shy;utes, and the judg&shy;ments, which the LORD our God hath com&shy;manded you?
    <sup>21</sup>&#8239;Then thou shalt say un&shy;to thy son, We were Pharaoh&#x02BC;s bondmen in Egypt; and <span class="small-caps">God</span> brought us out of Egypt with a might&shy;y hand:
    <sup>22</sup>&#8239;And <span class="small-caps">God</span> shewed signs and won&shy;ders, great and sore, up&shy;on Egypt, up&shy;on Pharaoh, and up&shy;on all his house&shy;hold, be&shy;fore our eyes:
    <sup>23</sup>&#8239;And he brought us out from thence, that he might bring us in, to give us the land which he sware un&shy;to our fa&shy;thers.
    <sup>24</sup>&#8239;And <span class="small-caps">God</span> com&shy;manded us to do all these stat&shy;utes, to fear the LORD our God, for our good al&shy;ways, that he might pre&shy;serve us a&shy;live, as it is at this day.
    <sup>25</sup>&#8239;And it shall be our right&shy;eous&shy;ness, if we ob&shy;serve to do all these com&shy;mand&shy;ments be&shy;fore <span class="small-caps">God</span> our God, as he hath com&shy;manded us.
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>7:1</sup>&#8239;When <span class="small-caps">God</span> thy God shall bring thee in&shy;to the land whith&shy;er thou goest to pos&shy;sess it, and hath cast out man&shy;y na&shy;tions be&shy;fore thee, the Hittites, and the Girgashites, and the Amorites, and the Canaanites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, sev&shy;en na&shy;tions greater and might&shy;i&shy;er than thou;
    <sup>2</sup>&#8239;And when <span class="small-caps">God</span> thy God shall de&shy;liv&shy;er them be&shy;fore thee; thou shalt smite them, and utterly de&shy;stroy them; thou shalt make no cov&shy;e&shy;nant with them, nor shew mer&shy;cy un&shy;to them:
    <sup>3</sup>&#8239;Nei&shy;ther shalt thou make mar&shy;riages with them; thy daugh&shy;ter thou shalt not give un&shy;to his son, nor his daugh&shy;ter shalt thou take un&shy;to thy son.
    <sup>4</sup>&#8239;For they will turn a&shy;way thy son from fol&shy;low&shy;ing me, that they may serve oth&shy;er gods: so will the an&shy;ger of <span class="small-caps">God</span> be kindled a&shy;gainst you, and de&shy;stroy thee sud&shy;den&shy;ly.
    <sup>5</sup>&#8239;But thus shall ye deal with them; ye shall de&shy;stroy their al&shy;tars, and break down their im&shy;ages, and cut down their groves, and burn their grav&shy;en im&shy;ages with fire.
    <sup>6</sup>&#8239;For thou art an ho&shy;ly peo&shy;ple un&shy;to <span class="small-caps">God</span> thy God: <span class="small-caps">God</span> thy God hath cho&shy;sen thee to be a spe&shy;cial peo&shy;ple un&shy;to him&shy;self, a&shy;bove all peo&shy;ple that are up&shy;on the face of the earth.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>7:7</sup>&#8239;<span class="small-caps">God</span> did not set his love up&shy;on you, nor choose you, be&shy;cause ye were more in num&shy;ber than any peo&shy;ple; for ye were the fewest of all peo&shy;ple:
    <sup>8</sup>&#8239;But be&shy;cause <span class="small-caps">God</span> loved you, and be&shy;cause he would keep the oath which he had sworn un&shy;to your fa&shy;thers, hath <span class="small-caps">God</span> brought you out with a might&shy;y hand, and re&shy;deemed you out of the house of bondmen, from the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt.
    <sup>9</sup>&#8239;Know there&shy;fore that <span class="small-caps">God</span> thy God, he is God, the faith&shy;ful God, which keepeth cov&shy;e&shy;nant and mer&shy;cy with them that love him and keep his com&shy;mand&shy;ments to a thou&shy;sand gen&shy;er&shy;a&shy;tions;
    <sup>10</sup>&#8239;And repayeth them that hate him to their face, to de&shy;stroy them: he will not be slack to him that hateth him, he will re&shy;pay him to his face.
    <sup>11</sup>&#8239;Thou shalt there&shy;fore keep the com&shy;mand&shy;ments, and the stat&shy;utes, and the judg&shy;ments, which I com&shy;mand thee this day, to do them.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>7:12</sup>&#8239;Where&shy;fore it shall come to pass, if ye heark&shy;en to these judg&shy;ments, and keep, and do them, that <span class="small-caps">God</span> thy God shall keep un&shy;to thee the cov&shy;e&shy;nant and the mer&shy;cy which he sware un&shy;to thy fa&shy;thers:
    <sup>13</sup>&#8239;And he will love thee, and bless thee, and mul&shy;ti&shy;ply thee: he will al&shy;so bless the fruit of thy womb, and the fruit of thy land, thy corn, and thy wine, and thine oil, the in&shy;crease of thy kin&shy;e, and the flocks of thy sheep, in the land which he sware un&shy;to thy fa&shy;thers to give thee.
    <sup>14</sup>&#8239;Thou shalt be bless&shy;ed a&shy;bove all peo&shy;ple: there shall not be male or fe&shy;male bar&shy;ren a&shy;mong you, or a&shy;mong your cat&shy;tle.
    <sup>15</sup>&#8239;And <span class="small-caps">God</span> will take a&shy;way from thee all sick&shy;ness, and will put none of the evil dis&shy;eases of Egypt, which thou knowest, up&shy;on thee; but will lay them up&shy;on all them that hate thee.
    <sup>16</sup>&#8239;And thou shalt con&shy;sume all the peo&shy;ple which <span class="small-caps">God</span> thy God shall de&shy;liv&shy;er thee; thine eye shall have no pit&shy;y up&shy;on them: nei&shy;ther shalt thou serve their gods; for that will be a snare un&shy;to thee.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>7:17</sup>&#8239;If thou shalt say in thine heart, These na&shy;tions are more than I; how can I dis&shy;pos&shy;sess them?
    <sup>18</sup>&#8239;Thou shalt not be a&shy;fraid of them: but shalt well re&shy;mem&shy;ber what <span class="small-caps">God</span> thy God did un&shy;to Pharaoh, and un&shy;to all Egypt;
    <sup>19</sup>&#8239;The great temp&shy;ta&shy;tions which thine eyes saw, and the signs, and the won&shy;ders, and the might&shy;y hand, and the stretched out arm, where&shy;by <span class="small-caps">God</span> thy God brought thee out: so shall <span class="small-caps">God</span> thy God do un&shy;to all the peo&shy;ple of whom thou art a&shy;fraid.
    <sup>20</sup>&#8239;More&shy;o&shy;ver <span class="small-caps">God</span> thy God will send the hor&shy;net a&shy;mong them, un&shy;til they that are left, and hide them&shy;selves from thee, be de&shy;stroyed.
    <sup>21</sup>&#8239;Thou shalt not be af&shy;frighted at them: for <span class="small-caps">God</span> thy God is a&shy;mong you, a might&shy;y God and ter&shy;ri&shy;ble.
    <sup>22</sup>&#8239;And <span class="small-caps">God</span> thy God will put out those na&shy;tions be&shy;fore thee by lit&shy;tle and lit&shy;tle: thou may&shy;est not con&shy;sume them at once, lest the beasts of the field in&shy;crease up&shy;on thee.
    <sup>23</sup>&#8239;But <span class="small-caps">God</span> thy God shall de&shy;liv&shy;er them un&shy;to thee, and shall de&shy;stroy them with a might&shy;y de&shy;struc&shy;tion, un&shy;til they be de&shy;stroyed.
    <sup>24</sup>&#8239;And he shall de&shy;liv&shy;er their kings in&shy;to thine hand, and thou shalt de&shy;stroy their name from un&shy;der heav&shy;en: there shall no man be a&shy;ble to stand be&shy;fore thee, un&shy;til thou have de&shy;stroyed them.
    <sup>25</sup>&#8239;The grav&shy;en im&shy;ages of their gods shall ye burn with fire: thou shalt not de&shy;sire the sil&shy;ver or gold that is on them, nor take it un&shy;to thee, lest thou be snared therin: for it is an a&shy;bom&shy;i&shy;na&shy;tion to <span class="small-caps">God</span> thy God.
    <sup>26</sup>&#8239;Nei&shy;ther shalt thou bring an a&shy;bom&shy;i&shy;na&shy;tion in&shy;to thine house, lest thou be a curs&shy;ed thing like it: but thou shalt utterly de&shy;test it, and thou shalt utterly ab&shy;hor it; for it is a curs&shy;ed thing.

    <sup>8:1</sup>&#8239;All the com&shy;mand&shy;ments which I com&shy;mand thee this day shall ye ob&shy;serve to do, that ye may live, and mul&shy;ti&shy;ply, and go in and pos&shy;sess the land which <span class="small-caps">God</span> sware un&shy;to your fa&shy;thers.
    <sup>2</sup>&#8239;And thou shalt re&shy;mem&shy;ber all the way which <span class="small-caps">God</span> thy God led thee these for&shy;ty years in the wil&shy;der&shy;ness, to hum&shy;ble thee, and to prove thee, to know what was in thine heart, wheth&shy;er thou wouldest keep his com&shy;mand&shy;ments, or no.
    <sup>3</sup>&#8239;And he humbled thee, and suf&shy;fered thee to hun&shy;ger, and fed thee with man&shy;na, which thou knewest not, nei&shy;ther did thy fa&shy;thers know; that he might make thee know that man doth not live by bread on&shy;ly, but by eve&shy;ry word that proceedeth out of the mouth of <span class="small-caps">God</span> doth man live.
    <sup>4</sup>&#8239;Thy rai&shy;ment waxed not old up&shy;on thee, nei&shy;ther did thy foot swell, these for&shy;ty years.
    <sup>5</sup>&#8239;Thou shalt al&shy;so con&shy;sid&shy;er in thine heart, that, as a man chasteneth his son, so <span class="small-caps">God</span> thy God chasteneth thee.
    <sup>6</sup>&#8239;There&shy;fore thou shalt keep the com&shy;mand&shy;ments of <span class="small-caps">God</span> thy God, to walk in his ways, and to fear him.
    <sup>7</sup>&#8239;For <span class="small-caps">God</span> thy God bringeth thee in&shy;to a good land, a land of brooks of wa&shy;ter, of foun&shy;tains and depths that spring out of val&shy;leys and hills;
    <sup>8</sup>&#8239;A land of wheat, and bar&shy;ley, and vines, and fig trees, and pom&shy;e&shy;gran&shy;ates; a land of oil ol&shy;ive, and hon&shy;ey;
    <sup>9</sup>&#8239;A land where&shy;in thou shalt eat bread with&shy;out scarce&shy;ness, thou shalt not lack any thing in it; a land whose stones are i&shy;ron, and out of whose hills thou may&shy;est dig brass.
    <sup>10</sup>&#8239;When thou hast eat&shy;en and art full, then thou shalt bless <span class="small-caps">God</span> thy God for the good land which he hath giv&shy;en thee.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>8:11</sup>&#8239;Be&shy;ware that thou for&shy;get not <span class="small-caps">God</span> thy God, in not keep&shy;ing his com&shy;mand&shy;ments, and his judg&shy;ments, and his stat&shy;utes, which I com&shy;mand thee this day:
    <sup>12</sup>&#8239;Lest when thou hast eat&shy;en and art full, and hast built good&shy;ly hous&shy;es, and dwelt there&shy;in;
    <sup>13</sup>&#8239;And when thy herds and thy flocks mul&shy;ti&shy;ply, and thy sil&shy;ver and thy gold is mul&shy;ti&shy;plied, and all that thou hast is mul&shy;ti&shy;plied;
    <sup>14</sup>&#8239;Then thine heart be lifted up, and thou for&shy;get <span class="small-caps">God</span> thy God, which brought thee forth out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bond&shy;age;
    <sup>15</sup>&#8239;Who led thee through that great and ter&shy;ri&shy;ble wil&shy;der&shy;ness, where&shy;in were fier&shy;y ser&shy;pents, and scor&shy;pi&shy;ons, and drought, where there was no wa&shy;ter; who brought thee forth wa&shy;ter out of the rock of flint;
    <sup>16</sup>&#8239;Who fed thee in the wil&shy;der&shy;ness with man&shy;na, which thy fa&shy;thers knew not, that he might hum&shy;ble thee, and that he might prove thee, to do thee good at thy lat&shy;ter end;
    <sup>17</sup>&#8239;And thou say in thine heart, My pow&shy;er and the might of mine hand hath got&shy;ten me this wealth.
    <sup>18</sup>&#8239;But thou shalt re&shy;mem&shy;ber <span class="small-caps">God</span> thy God: for it is he that giveth thee pow&shy;er to get wealth, that he may es&shy;tab&shy;lish his cov&shy;e&shy;nant which he sware un&shy;to thy fa&shy;thers, as it is this day.
    <sup>19</sup>&#8239;And it shall be, if thou do at all for&shy;get <span class="small-caps">God</span> thy God, and walk af&shy;ter oth&shy;er gods, and serve them, and wor&shy;ship them, I tes&shy;ti&shy;fy a&shy;gainst you this day that ye shall sure&shy;ly per&shy;ish.
    <sup>20</sup>&#8239;As the na&shy;tions which <span class="small-caps">God</span> destroyeth be&shy;fore your face, so shall ye per&shy;ish; be&shy;cause ye would not be o&shy;be&shy;di&shy;ent un&shy;to the voice of <span class="small-caps">God</span> your God.

<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>9:1</sup>&#8239;Hear, O Israel: Thou art to pass o&shy;ver Jor&shy;dan this day, to go in to pos&shy;sess na&shy;tions greater and might&shy;i&shy;er than thy&shy;self, cit&shy;ies great and fenced up to heav&shy;en,
    <sup>2</sup>&#8239;A peo&shy;ple great and tall, the chil&shy;dren of the Anakims, whom thou knowest, and of whom thou hast heard say, Who can stand be&shy;fore the chil&shy;dren of Anak!
    <sup>3</sup>&#8239;Un&shy;der&shy;stand there&shy;fore this day, that <span class="small-caps">God</span> thy God is he which goeth o&shy;ver be&shy;fore thee; as a con&shy;sum&shy;ing fire he shall de&shy;stroy them, and he shall bring them down be&shy;fore thy face: so shalt thou drive them out, and de&shy;stroy them quick&shy;ly, as <span class="small-caps">God</span> hath said un&shy;to thee.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>9:4</sup>&#8239;Speak not thou in thine heart, af&shy;ter that <span class="small-caps">God</span> thy God hath cast them out from be&shy;fore thee, say&shy;ing, For my right&shy;eous&shy;ness the LORD hath brought me in to pos&shy;sess this land: but for the wick&shy;ed&shy;ness of these na&shy;tions <span class="small-caps">God</span> doth drive them out from be&shy;fore thee.
    <sup>5</sup>&#8239;Not for thy right&shy;eous&shy;ness, or for the uprightness of thine heart, dost thou go to pos&shy;sess their land: but for the wick&shy;ed&shy;ness of these na&shy;tions <span class="small-caps">God</span> thy God doth drive them out from be&shy;fore thee, and that he may per&shy;form the word which <span class="small-caps">God</span> sware un&shy;to thy fa&shy;thers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>9:6</sup>&#8239;Un&shy;der&shy;stand there&shy;fore, that <span class="small-caps">God</span> thy God giveth thee not this good land to pos&shy;sess it for thy right&shy;eous&shy;ness; for thou art a stiffnecked peo&shy;ple.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>9:7</sup>&#8239;Re&shy;mem&shy;ber, and for&shy;get not, how thou provokedst <span class="small-caps">God</span> thy God to wrath in the wil&shy;der&shy;ness: from the day that thou didst de&shy;part out of the land of Egypt, un&shy;til ye came un&shy;to this place, ye have been re&shy;bel&shy;lious a&shy;gainst <span class="small-caps">God</span>.
    <sup>8</sup>&#8239;Al&shy;so in Horeb ye pro&shy;voked <span class="small-caps">God</span> to wrath, so that <span class="small-caps">God</span> was an&shy;gry with you to have de&shy;stroyed you.
    <sup>9</sup>&#8239;When I was gone up in&shy;to the mount to re&shy;ceive the ta&shy;bles of stone, e&shy;ven the ta&shy;bles of the cov&shy;e&shy;nant which <span class="small-caps">God</span> made with you, then I a&shy;bode in the mount for&shy;ty days and for&shy;ty nights, I nei&shy;ther did eat bread nor drink wa&shy;ter:
    <sup>10</sup>&#8239;And <span class="small-caps">God</span> de&shy;liv&shy;ered un&shy;to me two ta&shy;bles of stone writ&shy;ten with the fin&shy;ger of God; and on them was writ&shy;ten ac&shy;cord&shy;ing to all the words, which <span class="small-caps">God</span> spake with you in the mount out of the midst of the fire in the day of the as&shy;sem&shy;bly.
    <sup>11</sup>&#8239;And it came to pass at the end of for&shy;ty days and for&shy;ty nights, that <span class="small-caps">God</span> gave me the two ta&shy;bles of stone, e&shy;ven the ta&shy;bles of the cov&shy;e&shy;nant.
    <sup>12</sup>&#8239;And <span class="small-caps">God</span> said un&shy;to me, A&shy;rise, get thee down quick&shy;ly from hence; for thy peo&shy;ple which thou hast brought forth out of Egypt have cor&shy;rupted them&shy;selves; they are quick&shy;ly turned a&shy;side out of the way which I com&shy;manded them; they have made them a mol&shy;ten im&shy;age.
    <sup>13</sup>&#8239;Fur&shy;ther&shy;more <span class="small-caps">God</span> spake un&shy;to me, say&shy;ing, I have seen this peo&shy;ple, and, be&shy;hold, it is a stiffnecked peo&shy;ple:
    <sup>14</sup>&#8239;Let me a&shy;lone, that I may de&shy;stroy them, and blot out their name from un&shy;der heav&shy;en: and I will make of thee a na&shy;tion might&shy;i&shy;er and greater than they.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>9:15</sup>&#8239;So I turned and came down from the mount, and the mount burned with fire: and the two ta&shy;bles of the cov&shy;e&shy;nant were in my two hands.
    <sup>16</sup>&#8239;And I looked, and, be&shy;hold, ye had sinned a&shy;gainst <span class="small-caps">God</span> your God, and had made you a mol&shy;ten calf: ye had turned a&shy;side quick&shy;ly out of the way which <span class="small-caps">God</span> had com&shy;manded you.
    <sup>17</sup>&#8239;And I took the two ta&shy;bles, and cast them out of my two hands, and brake them be&shy;fore your eyes.
    <sup>18</sup>&#8239;And I fell down be&shy;fore <span class="small-caps">God</span>, as at the first, for&shy;ty days and for&shy;ty nights: I did nei&shy;ther eat bread, nor drink wa&shy;ter, be&shy;cause of all your sins which ye sinned, in do&shy;ing wickedly in the sight of <span class="small-caps">God</span>, to pro&shy;voke him to an&shy;ger.
    <sup>19</sup>&#8239;For I was a&shy;fraid of the an&shy;ger and hot dis&shy;pleas&shy;ure, where&shy;with the LORD was wroth a&shy;gainst you to de&shy;stroy you. But <span class="small-caps">God</span> heark&shy;ened un&shy;to me at that time al&shy;so.
    <sup>20</sup>&#8239;And <span class="small-caps">God</span> was ver&shy;y an&shy;gry with Aaron to have de&shy;stroyed him: and I prayed for Aaron al&shy;so the same time.
    <sup>21</sup>&#8239;And I took your sin, the calf which ye had made, and burnt it with fire, and stamped it, and ground it ver&shy;y small, e&shy;ven un&shy;til it was as small as dust: and I cast the dust there&shy;of in&shy;to the brook that de&shy;scended out of the mount.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>9:22</sup>&#8239;And at Taberah, and at Massah, and at Kibrothhattaavah, ye pro&shy;voked <span class="small-caps">God</span> to wrath.
    <sup>23</sup>&#8239;Like&shy;wise when <span class="small-caps">God</span> sent you from Kadeshbarnea, say&shy;ing, Go up and pos&shy;sess the land which I have giv&shy;en you; then ye rebelled a&shy;gainst the com&shy;mand&shy;ment of <span class="small-caps">God</span> your God, and ye be&shy;lieved him not, nor heark&shy;ened to his voice.
    <sup>24</sup>&#8239;Ye have been re&shy;bel&shy;lious a&shy;gainst <span class="small-caps">God</span> from the day that I knew you.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>9:25</sup>&#8239;Thus I fell down be&shy;fore <span class="small-caps">God</span> for&shy;ty days and for&shy;ty nights, as I fell down at the first; be&shy;cause <span class="small-caps">God</span> had said he would de&shy;stroy you.
    <sup>26</sup>&#8239;I prayed there&shy;fore un&shy;to <span class="small-caps">God</span>, and said, O Lord GOD, de&shy;stroy not thy peo&shy;ple and thine in&shy;her&shy;it&shy;ance, which thou hast re&shy;deemed through thy great&shy;ness, which thou hast brought forth out of Egypt with a might&shy;y hand.
    <sup>27</sup>&#8239;Re&shy;mem&shy;ber thy serv&shy;ants, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; look not un&shy;to the stub&shy;born&shy;ness of this peo&shy;ple, nor to their wick&shy;ed&shy;ness, nor to their sin:
    <sup>28</sup>&#8239;Lest the land whence thou broughtest us out say, Be&shy;cause <span class="small-caps">God</span> was not a&shy;ble to bring them in&shy;to the land which he prom&shy;ised them, and be&shy;cause he hat&shy;ed them, he hath brought them out to slay them in the wil&shy;der&shy;ness.
    <sup>29</sup>&#8239;Yet they are thy peo&shy;ple and thine in&shy;her&shy;it&shy;ance, which thou broughtest out by thy might&shy;y pow&shy;er and by thy stretched out arm.
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>10:1</sup>&#8239;At that time <span class="small-caps">God</span> said un&shy;to me, Hew thee two ta&shy;bles of stone like un&shy;to the first, and come up un&shy;to me in&shy;to the mount, and make thee an ark of wood.
    <sup>2</sup>&#8239;And I will write on the ta&shy;bles the words that were in the first ta&shy;bles which thou brakest, and thou shalt put them in the ark.
    <sup>3</sup>&#8239;And I made an ark of shittim wood, and hewed two ta&shy;bles of stone like un&shy;to the first, and went up in&shy;to the mount, hav&shy;ing the two ta&shy;bles in mine hand.
    <sup>4</sup>&#8239;And he wrote on the ta&shy;bles, ac&shy;cord&shy;ing to the first writ&shy;ing, the ten com&shy;mand&shy;ments, which <span class="small-caps">God</span> spake un&shy;to you in the mount out of the midst of the fire in the day of the as&shy;sem&shy;bly: and <span class="small-caps">God</span> gave them un&shy;to me.
    <sup>5</sup>&#8239;And I turned my&shy;self and came down from the mount, and put the ta&shy;bles in the ark which I had made; and there they be, as the LORD com&shy;manded me.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>10:6</sup>&#8239;And the chil&shy;dren of Israel took their jour&shy;ney from Beeroth of the chil&shy;dren of Jaakan to Mosera: there Aaron died, and there he was bur&shy;ied; and Eleazar his son min&shy;is&shy;tered in the priest&#x02BC;s of&shy;fice in his stead.
    <sup>7</sup>&#8239;From thence they jour&shy;neyed un&shy;to Gudgodah; and from Gudgodah to Jotbath, a land of riv&shy;ers of wa&shy;ters.
    <sup>8</sup>&#8239;At that time <span class="small-caps">God</span> sep&shy;a&shy;rat&shy;ed the tribe of Levi, to bear the ark of the cov&shy;e&shy;nant of <span class="small-caps">God</span>, to stand be&shy;fore <span class="small-caps">God</span> to min&shy;is&shy;ter un&shy;to him, and to bless in his name, un&shy;to this day.
    <sup>9</sup>&#8239;Where&shy;fore Levi hath no part nor in&shy;her&shy;it&shy;ance with his breth&shy;ren; <span class="small-caps">God</span> is his in&shy;her&shy;it&shy;ance, ac&shy;cord&shy;ing as <span class="small-caps">God</span> thy God prom&shy;ised him.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>10:10</sup>&#8239;And I stayed in the mount, ac&shy;cord&shy;ing to the first time, for&shy;ty days and for&shy;ty nights; and <span class="small-caps">God</span> heark&shy;ened un&shy;to me at that time al&shy;so, and <span class="small-caps">God</span> would not de&shy;stroy thee.
    <sup>11</sup>&#8239;And <span class="small-caps">God</span> said un&shy;to me, A&shy;rise, take thy jour&shy;ney be&shy;fore the peo&shy;ple, that they may go in and pos&shy;sess the land, which I sware un&shy;to their fa&shy;thers to give un&shy;to them.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>10:12</sup>&#8239;And now, Israel, what doth <span class="small-caps">God</span> thy God re&shy;quire of thee, but to fear <span class="small-caps">God</span> thy God, to walk in all his ways, and to love him, and to serve <span class="small-caps">God</span> thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul,
    <sup>13</sup>&#8239;To keep the com&shy;mand&shy;ments of <span class="small-caps">God</span>, and his stat&shy;utes, which I com&shy;mand thee this day for thy good?
    <sup>14</sup>&#8239;Be&shy;hold, the heav&shy;en and the heav&shy;en of heav&shy;ens is <span class="small-caps">God</span>&#x02BC;s thy God, the earth al&shy;so, with all that there&shy;in is.
    <sup>15</sup>&#8239;On&shy;ly <span class="small-caps">God</span> had a de&shy;light in thy fa&shy;thers to love them, and he chose their seed af&shy;ter them, e&shy;ven you a&shy;bove all peo&shy;ple, as it is this day.
    <sup>16</sup>&#8239;Cir&shy;cum&shy;cise there&shy;fore the fore&shy;skin of your heart, and be no more stiffnecked.
    <sup>17</sup>&#8239;For <span class="small-caps">God</span> your God is God of gods, and Lord of lords, a great God, a might&shy;y, and a ter&shy;ri&shy;ble, which regardeth not per&shy;sons, nor taketh re&shy;ward:
    <sup>18</sup>&#8239;He doth ex&shy;e&shy;cute the judg&shy;ment of the fa&shy;ther&shy;less and wid&shy;ow, and loveth the strang&shy;er, in giv&shy;ing him food and rai&shy;ment.
    <sup>19</sup>&#8239;Love ye there&shy;fore the strang&shy;er: for ye were stran&shy;gers in the land of Egypt.
    <sup>20</sup>&#8239;Thou shalt fear <span class="small-caps">God</span> thy God; him shalt thou serve, and to him shalt thou cleave, and swear by his name.
    <sup>21</sup>&#8239;He is thy praise, and he is thy God, that hath done for thee these great and ter&shy;ri&shy;ble things, which thine eyes have seen.
    <sup>22</sup>&#8239;Thy fa&shy;thers went down in&shy;to Egypt with three&shy;score and ten per&shy;sons; and now <span class="small-caps">God</span> thy God hath made thee as the stars of heav&shy;en for mul&shy;ti&shy;tude.
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>11:1</sup>&#8239;There&shy;fore thou shalt love <span class="small-caps">God</span> thy God, and keep his charge, and his stat&shy;utes, and his judg&shy;ments, and his com&shy;mand&shy;ments, al&shy;way.
    <sup>2</sup>&#8239;And know ye this day: for I speak not with your chil&shy;dren which have not known, and which have not seen the chas&shy;tise&shy;ment of the LORD your God, his great&shy;ness, his might&shy;y hand, and his stretched out arm,
    <sup>3</sup>&#8239;And his mir&shy;a&shy;cles, and his acts, which he did in the midst of Egypt un&shy;to Pharaoh the king of Egypt, and un&shy;to all his land;
    <sup>4</sup>&#8239;And what he did un&shy;to the ar&shy;my of Egypt, un&shy;to their hors&shy;es, and to their char&shy;i&shy;ots; how he made the wa&shy;ter of the Red sea to o&shy;ver&shy;flow them as they pur&shy;sued af&shy;ter you, and how <span class="small-caps">God</span> hath de&shy;stroyed them un&shy;to this day;
    <sup>5</sup>&#8239;And what he did un&shy;to you in the wil&shy;der&shy;ness, un&shy;til ye came in&shy;to this place;
    <sup>6</sup>&#8239;And what he did un&shy;to Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, the son of Reuben: how the earth o&shy;pened her mouth, and swal&shy;lowed them up, and their house&shy;holds, and their tents, and all the sub&shy;stance that was in their pos&shy;ses&shy;sion, in the midst of all Israel:
    <sup>7</sup>&#8239;But your eyes have seen all the great acts of <span class="small-caps">God</span> which he did.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>11:8</sup>&#8239;There&shy;fore shall ye keep all the com&shy;mand&shy;ments which I com&shy;mand you this day, that ye may be strong, and go in and pos&shy;sess the land, whith&shy;er ye go to pos&shy;sess it;
    <sup>9</sup>&#8239;And that ye may pro&shy;long your days in the land, which <span class="small-caps">God</span> sware un&shy;to your fa&shy;thers to give un&shy;to them and to their seed, a land that floweth with milk and hon&shy;ey.
    <sup>10</sup>&#8239;For the land, whith&shy;er thou goest in to pos&shy;sess it, is not as the land of Egypt, from whence ye came out, where thou sowedst thy seed, and wateredst it with thy foot, as a gar&shy;den of herbs:
    <sup>11</sup>&#8239;But the land, whith&shy;er ye go to pos&shy;sess it, is a land of hills and val&shy;leys, and drinketh wa&shy;ter of the rain of heav&shy;en:
    <sup>12</sup>&#8239;A land which <span class="small-caps">God</span> thy God careth for: the eyes of <span class="small-caps">God</span> thy God are al&shy;ways up&shy;on it, from the be&shy;gin&shy;ning of the year e&shy;ven un&shy;to the end of the year.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>11:13</sup>&#8239;And it shall come to pass, if ye shall heark&shy;en dil&shy;i&shy;gent&shy;ly un&shy;to my com&shy;mand&shy;ments which I com&shy;mand you this day, to love <span class="small-caps">God</span> your God, and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul,
    <sup>14</sup>&#8239;That I will give you the rain of your land in his due sea&shy;son, the first rain and the lat&shy;ter rain, that thou may&shy;est gath&shy;er in thy corn, and thy wine, and thine oil.
    <sup>15</sup>&#8239;And I will send grass in thy fields for thy cat&shy;tle, that thou may&shy;est eat and be full.
    <sup>16</sup>&#8239;Take heed to your&shy;selves, that your heart be not de&shy;ceived, and ye turn a&shy;side, and serve oth&shy;er gods, and wor&shy;ship them;
    <sup>17</sup>&#8239;And then <span class="small-caps">God</span>&#x02BC;s wrath be kindled a&shy;gainst you, and he shut up the heav&shy;en, that there be no rain, and that the land yield not her fruit; and lest ye per&shy;ish quick&shy;ly from off the good land which <span class="small-caps">God</span> giveth you.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>11:18</sup>&#8239;There&shy;fore shall ye lay up these my words in your heart and in your soul, and bind them for a sign up&shy;on your hand, that they may be as front&shy;lets be&shy;tween your eyes.
    <sup>19</sup>&#8239;And ye shall teach them your chil&shy;dren, speak&shy;ing of them when thou sittest in thine house, and when thou walkest by the way, when thou li&shy;est down, and when thou risest up.
    <sup>20</sup>&#8239;And thou shalt write them up&shy;on the door posts of thine house, and up&shy;on thy gates:
