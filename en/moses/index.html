    <sup>5:1</sup>&#8239;Mo&shy;ses sum&shy;moned all Israel and said to them, Hear the stat&shy;utes and or&shy;di&shy;nances that I speak to&shy;day. Learn them and ob&shy;serve them care&shy;ful&shy;ly.
    <sup>2</sup>&#8239;<span class="small-caps">God</span> made a cov&shy;e&shy;nant with us in Horeb.

    <sup>8</sup>&#8239;Bind them as a sign on your hand, and as front&shy;lets on your fore&shy;head.
    <sup>9</sup>&#8239;Write them on the door&shy;posts of your house and on your gates.

<p>
    <sup>6:10</sup>&#8239;When <span class="small-caps">God</span> brings you in&shy;to the land that he swore to your fa&shy;thers Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob that he would give you &mdash; a land with large and splen&shy;did cit&shy;ies,

    <sup>12</sup>&#8239;then be care&shy;ful not to for&shy;get <span class="small-caps">God</span>, who brought you out of Egypt, out of slav&shy;er&shy;y.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>6:13</sup>&#8239;Fear <span class="small-caps">God</span>, wor&shy;ship him, and swear by his name.
    <sup>14</sup>&#8239;Don&#x02BC;t fol&shy;low oth&shy;er gods, the gods of the peo&shy;ple a&shy;round you,
    <sup>15</sup>&#8239;lest the an&shy;ger of <span class="small-caps">God</span> be kindled a&shy;gainst you, and de&shy;stroy you from the face of the earth.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>6:17</sup>&#8239;Dil&shy;i&shy;gent&shy;ly keep the com&shy;mand&shy;ments of <span class="small-caps">God</span>, his testimonies, and his stat&shy;utes, which he has com&shy;manded you.
    <sup>18</sup>&#8239;Do what is right and good in <span class="small-caps">God</span>&#x02BC;s sight that it may be well with you, and that you may go in and pos&shy;sess the good land which <span class="small-caps">God</span> swore to give to your fa&shy;thers.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>6:20</sup>&#8239;When your son asks you, <q>What is the mean&shy;ing of the testimonies, the stat&shy;utes, and the rules that <span class="small-caps">God</span> has com&shy;manded you?</q>
    <sup>21</sup>&#8239;tell him, <q>We were slaves to Pharaoh in Egypt, but <span class="small-caps">God</span> brought us out of Egypt with a might&shy;y hand.
    <sup>22</sup>&#8239;Be&shy;fore our eyes <span class="small-caps">God</span> showed great and ter&shy;ri&shy;ble signs and won&shy;ders a&shy;gainst Egypt, Pharaoh, and all his house&shy;hold.
    <sup>23</sup>&#8239;He brought us out from there in or&shy;der to give us the land that he swore to our fa&shy;thers.
    <sup>24</sup>&#8239;So <span class="small-caps">God</span> com&shy;manded us to ob&shy;serve all these stat&shy;utes and to fear <span class="small-caps">God</span> for our good and our sur&shy;viv&shy;al.
    <sup>25</sup>&#8239;It will be right&shy;eous&shy;ness for us if we ob&shy;serve all these com&shy;mand&shy;ments be&shy;fore <span class="small-caps">God</span>, just as he com&shy;manded us.</q>
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>7:1</sup>&#8239;When <span class="small-caps">God</span> brings you in&shy;to the land, and clears a&shy;way man&shy;y na&shy;tions be&shy;fore you,
    <sup>3</sup>&#8239;don&#x02BC;t in&shy;ter&shy;mar&shy;ry with them by giv&shy;ing your daugh&shy;ters to theirs sons or tak&shy;ing their daugh&shy;ters for your sons.
    <sup>4</sup>&#8239;They will turn your chil&shy;dren a&shy;way from me, to wor&shy;ship oth&shy;er gods.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>7:7</sup>&#8239;<span class="small-caps">God</span> didn&#x02BC;t choose you be&shy;cause you were more nu&shy;mer&shy;ous than oth&shy;er peo&shy;ple, for your were the fewest of all peo&shy;ples,
    <sup>8</sup>&#8239;but be&shy;cause <span class="small-caps">God</span> loves you and is keep&shy;ing the oath that he swore to your fa&shy;thers, <span class="small-caps">God</span> brought you out with a might&shy;y hand, and re&shy;deemed you from slav&shy;er&shy;y, from the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt.
    <sup>9</sup>&#8239;Know that <span class="small-caps">God</span> is God, the faith&shy;ful God who keeps his cov&shy;e&shy;nant and his love for a thou&shy;sand gen&shy;er&shy;a&shy;tions with those who love him and keep his com&shy;mand&shy;ments.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>7:12</sup>&#8239;If you lis&shy;ten to and care&shy;ful&shy;ly keep these or&shy;di&shy;nances, <span class="small-caps">God</span> will keep the cov&shy;e&shy;nant of love with you that he swore to your fa&shy;thers.
    <sup>13</sup>&#8239;He will love you, bless you, and mul&shy;ti&shy;ply you. He will bless the fruit of your womb, the crops of your land, and the in&shy;crease of your herd in the land he swore to your fa&shy;thers that he would give you.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>7:17</sup>&#8239;If you say in your heart, <q>These na&shy;tions are greater than I. How can I dis&shy;pos&shy;sess them?</q>
    <sup>18</sup>&#8239;Don&#x02BC;t be a&shy;fraid of them.  Re&shy;mem&shy;ber what <span class="small-caps">God</span> did to Pharaoh and to all Egypt.
    <sup>21</sup>&#8239;Don&#x02BC;t dread them, for <span class="small-caps">God</span> is a&shy;mong you, a great and awe&shy;some God.
    <sup>22</sup>&#8239;<span class="small-caps">God</span> will clear a&shy;way these na&shy;tions be&shy;fore you lit&shy;tle by lit&shy;tle. You will not e&shy;lim&shy;i&shy;nate them all at once, lest the wild an&shy;i&shy;mals be&shy;come too nu&shy;mer&shy;ous for you.
    <sup>25</sup>&#8239;Burn the carved im&shy;ages of their gods. Don&#x02BC;t cov&shy;et the sil&shy;ver or gold that is on them, nor take it for your&shy;self, lest you be en&shy;snared by it.
    <sup>26</sup>&#8239;Don&#x02BC;t bring an a&shy;bom&shy;i&shy;na&shy;tion in&shy;to your house, lest you be set a&shy;part for de&shy;struc&shy;tion. In&shy;stead, utterly de&shy;test it and ab&shy;hor it.

<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>8:2</sup>&#8239;Re&shy;mem&shy;ber how <span class="small-caps">God</span> led you these for&shy;ty years in the wil&shy;der&shy;ness, to hum&shy;ble you, and to test what was in your heart, wheth&shy;er you would keep his com&shy;mand&shy;ments.
    <sup>3</sup>&#8239;He humbled you, let you go hun&shy;gry, then fed you with man&shy;na, which nei&shy;ther you nor your fa&shy;thers had known, to teach you that man does not live by bread a&shy;lone, but by eve&shy;ry word that co&shy;mes from the mouth of <span class="small-caps">God</span>.
    <sup>5</sup>&#8239;Know in your heart that <span class="small-caps">God</span> dis&shy;ci&shy;plines you just as a man dis&shy;ci&shy;plines his son.
    <sup>6</sup>&#8239;There&shy;fore keep the com&shy;mand&shy;ments of <span class="small-caps">God</span> by walk&shy;ing in his ways and by fearing him.

    <sup>12</sup>&#8239;Oth&shy;er&shy;wise, once you&#x02BC;ve eat&shy;en and are sat&shy;is&shy;fied, and have built good hous&shy;es to live in,
    <sup>13</sup>&#8239;and when your herds mul&shy;ti&shy;ply, and your sil&shy;ver and gold mul&shy;ti&shy;ply, and eve&shy;ry&shy;thing you have multiplies,
    <sup>14</sup>&#8239;then your heart will be&shy;come proud, and you will for&shy;get <span class="small-caps">God</span>,
    <sup>17</sup>&#8239;and you may say in your heart, <q>My pow&shy;er and the strength of my hand has made me this wealth.</q>
    <sup>18</sup>&#8239;But re&shy;mem&shy;ber that <span class="small-caps">God</span> gives you pow&shy;er to make wealth in or&shy;der to con&shy;firm his cov&shy;e&shy;nant that he swore to your fa&shy;thers.

<p>
    <sup>9:4</sup>&#8239;Once <span class="small-caps">God</span> has driv&shy;en the peo&shy;ple out be&shy;fore you, don&#x02BC;t say in your heart, <q><span class="small-caps">God</span> brought me in to pos&shy;sess this land be&shy;cause of my right&shy;eous&shy;ness.</q> In&shy;stead, <span class="small-caps">God</span> drives them out be&shy;cause of their wick&shy;ed&shy;ness.

</p>

<p>
    <sup>11:16</sup>&#8239;Be care&shy;ful not to be en&shy;ticed to turn a&shy;side and serve oth&shy;er gods and wor&shy;ship them.
