<h2>Digest of Plan</h2>
<p>
    <sup>1</sup>&#8239;God the Father and God the Mother have many children.
    <sup>2</sup>&#8239;For a long time, they all lived together in heaven.
    <sup>3</sup>&#8239;Father and Mother have vast wisdom, and immortal, perfect bodies.
    <sup>4</sup>&#8239;Their children were immortal spirits without physical bodies and with little knowledge.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>5</sup>&#8239;The Parents wanted their children to have wisdom and immortal, perfect bodies.
    <sup>6</sup>&#8239;In preparation for their children&#x02BC;s future, the Parents began the universe, allowing it to progress and form;
    <sup>7</sup>&#8239;guiding it when necessary.
    <sup>8</sup>&#8239;In heaven, during the preparation, the Parents taught their children many good things.
    <sup>9</sup>&#8239;The children enjoyed progress and learned as much as they could.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>10</sup>&#8239;When mortal bodies were ready, Father and Mother began to send their children into mortality through birth.
    <sup>11</sup>&#8239;They sent each child to a body, on a planet, at a time, and in a location optimal for that child&#x02BC;s growth.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>12</sup>&#8239;Living in a mortal body clouds each child&#x02BC;s memory of their former life in heaven.
    <sup>13</sup>&#8239;Some children can only feel the Parents&#x02BC; influence very quietly.
    <sup>14</sup>&#8239;Others can feel it more plainly.
    <sup>15</sup>&#8239;All can learn to feel it better.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>16</sup>&#8239;Father and Mother want all their children to be happy, to master their mortal bodies, and to remember and act on the goal of wisdom and immortality.
    <sup>17</sup>&#8239;To help them remember and act, the Parents have invited some of their children to be messengers.
    <sup>18</sup>&#8239;Many messengers declined the invitation.
    <sup>19</sup>&#8239;Some delivered the message faithfully at first but allowed distractions of the world to lead them astray and confuse their message.
    <sup>20</sup>&#8239;They often did not know that they were distracted.  People called some of these messengers prophets.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>21</sup>&#8239;Faithful messengers were found regardless of time, place, culture, status or religion into which they had been born.
    <sup>22</sup>&#8239;The Parents knew that different messengers would help different children to progress, so they invited messengers of all kinds.
    <sup>23</sup>&#8239;The essence of these messages has been stable, while the details vary to accommodate mortal bias.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>24</sup>&#8239;The Parents remain involved in and mindful of their children&#x02BC;s lives.
    <sup>25</sup>&#8239;Their involvement consists mainly in delivering information to their children when they need it and request it.
    <sup>26</sup>&#8239;Physical intervention is rare.
    <sup>27</sup>&#8239;Compulsion is absent.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>28</sup>&#8239;Upon death, the Parents welcome each child home.
    <sup>29</sup>&#8239;The child, now wiser, receives an eternal reward calculated to bring them satisfaction and joy according to who they have become.
</p>

    <sup>26</sup>&#8239;I plan to act.</q>
