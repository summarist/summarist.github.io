<h2>Digest of Plan</h2>
<p>
God the Father and God the Mother have many children.  For a long
time, they all lived together in heaven.  Father and Mother have vast
wisdom, and immortal, perfect bodies.  Their children were immortal
spirits without physical bodies and with little knowledge.
</p>

<p>
The Parents wanted their children to have wisdom and immortal, perfect
bodies.  In preparation for their children&#x02BC;s future, the Parents began
the universe, allowing it to progress and form; guiding it when
necessary.  In heaven, during the preparation, the Parents taught
their children many good things.  The children enjoyed progress and
learned as much as they could.
</p>

<p>
When mortal bodies were ready, Father and Mother began to send their
children into mortality through birth.  They sent each child to a
body, on a planet, at a time, and in a location optimal for that
child&#x02BC;s growth.
</p>

<p>
Living in a mortal body clouds each child&#x02BC;s memory of their former
life in heaven.  Some children can only feel the Parents&#x02BC; influence
very quietly.  Others can feel it more plainly.  All can learn to feel
it better.
</p>

<p>
Father and Mother want all their children to be happy, to master their
mortal bodies, and to remember and act on the goal of wisdom and
immortality.  To help them remember and act, the Parents have invited
some of their children to be messengers.  Many messengers declined the
invitation.  Some delivered the message faithfully at first but
allowed distractions of the world to lead them astray and confuse
their message.  They often did not know that they were distracted.
People called some of these messengers prophets.
</p>

<p>
Faithful messengers were found regardless of time, place, culture,
status or religion into which they had been born.  The Parents knew
that different messengers would help different children to progress,
so they invited messengers of all kinds.  The essence of these
messages has been stable, while the details vary to accommodate mortal
bias.
</p>

<p>
The Parents remain involved in and mindful of their children&#x02BC;s lives.
Their involvement consists mainly in delivering information to their
children when they need it and request it.  Physical intervention is
rare.  Compulsion is absent.
</p>

<p>
Upon death, the Parents welcome each child home.  The child, now
wiser, receives an eternal reward calculated to bring them
satisfaction and joy according to who they have become.
</p>

<p>
Gratitude: Stand with your eyes closed and your face turned toward the
sky until you are tranquil.  Recite, <q>God in heaven, I thank you for
life, air to breathe, quiet places, and the ability to choose; for
challenges, work, emotion, and the gift of reason.</q>  In your own
words, express heartfelt gratitude to God.
</p>

<p>
Confession: Bow, eyes closed, hands on knees, face downward. Recite,
<q>God in heaven, I strive to keep the Priorities, and to learn from
my failures when I don&#x02BC;t.  I want to be more like you. I fall short in
these ways.</q>  In your own words, confess to God your failures,
weaknesses, and ways you need to improve.
</p>

<p>
Petition: Squat, arms outstretched, hands cupped to form a bowl, your
face forward.  Recite, <q>God in heaven, you have given me a beautiful
world to live in, messengers to teach me, and guidance when I
ask. Hear my prayer.</q>  In your own words, request God&#x02BC;s guidance in
achieving your righteous desires.
</p>

<p>
Listen: Stand with your face downward. Recite, <q>God in heaven, you
let rain fall on good and evil people alike. You send guidance through
a gentle thought, a quite feeling, or a soft voice. I&#x02BC;m listening.</q>
Listen for God&#x02BC;s guidance.
</p>

<p>
Action: Bow, eyes closed, hands on knees, face downward. Recite,
<q>God in heaven, the greatest gift brings no profit when left
unused. I thank you for giving me guidance. I plan to act.</q> In your
own words, tell God how you will act on the guidance you have
received.
