<p>
    <sup>1</sup>&#8239;God the Fa&shy;ther and God the Moth&shy;er have man&shy;y chil&shy;dren.
    <sup>2</sup>&#8239;For a long time, they all lived to&shy;geth&shy;er in heav&shy;en.
    <sup>3</sup>&#8239;Fa&shy;ther and Moth&shy;er have vast wis&shy;dom, and im&shy;mor&shy;tal, per&shy;fect bod&shy;ies.
    <sup>4</sup>&#8239;Their chil&shy;dren were im&shy;mor&shy;tal spir&shy;its with&shy;out phys&shy;i&shy;cal bod&shy;ies and with lit&shy;tle knowl&shy;edge.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>5</sup>&#8239;The Par&shy;ents wanted their chil&shy;dren to have wis&shy;dom and im&shy;mor&shy;tal, per&shy;fect bod&shy;ies.
    <sup>6</sup>&#8239;In prep&shy;a&shy;ra&shy;tion for their chil&shy;dren&#x02BC;s fu&shy;ture, the Par&shy;ents be&shy;gan the u&shy;ni&shy;verse, allowing it to pro&shy;gress and form;
    <sup>7</sup>&#8239;guid&shy;ing it when nec&shy;es&shy;sar&shy;y.
    <sup>8</sup>&#8239;In heav&shy;en, dur&shy;ing the prep&shy;a&shy;ra&shy;tion, the Par&shy;ents taught their chil&shy;dren man&shy;y good things.
    <sup>9</sup>&#8239;The chil&shy;dren en&shy;joyed pro&shy;gress and learn&shy;ed as much as they could.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>10</sup>&#8239;When mor&shy;tal bod&shy;ies were read&shy;y, Fa&shy;ther and Moth&shy;er be&shy;gan to send their chil&shy;dren in&shy;to mor&shy;tal&shy;i&shy;ty through birth.
    <sup>11</sup>&#8239;They sent each child to a bod&shy;y, on a plan&shy;et, at a time, and in a lo&shy;ca&shy;tion op&shy;ti&shy;mal for that child&#x02BC;s growth.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>12</sup>&#8239;Liv&shy;ing in a mor&shy;tal bod&shy;y clouds each child&#x02BC;s mem&shy;o&shy;ry of their for&shy;mer life in heav&shy;en.
    <sup>13</sup>&#8239;Some chil&shy;dren can on&shy;ly feel the Par&shy;ents&#x02BC; in&shy;flu&shy;ence ver&shy;y qui&shy;et&shy;ly.
    <sup>14</sup>&#8239;Oth&shy;ers can feel it more plain&shy;ly.
    <sup>15</sup>&#8239;All can learn to feel it bet&shy;ter.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>16</sup>&#8239;Fa&shy;ther and Moth&shy;er want all their chil&shy;dren to be hap&shy;py, to mas&shy;ter their mor&shy;tal bod&shy;ies, and to re&shy;mem&shy;ber and act on the goal of wis&shy;dom and im&shy;mor&shy;tal&shy;i&shy;ty.
    <sup>17</sup>&#8239;To help them re&shy;mem&shy;ber and act, the Par&shy;ents have in&shy;vit&shy;ed some of their chil&shy;dren to be mes&shy;sen&shy;gers.
    <sup>18</sup>&#8239;Man&shy;y mes&shy;sen&shy;gers de&shy;clined the in&shy;vi&shy;ta&shy;tion.
    <sup>19</sup>&#8239;Some de&shy;liv&shy;ered the mes&shy;sage faith&shy;ful&shy;ly at first but al&shy;lowed dis&shy;trac&shy;tions of the world to lead them a&shy;stray and con&shy;fuse their mes&shy;sage.
    <sup>20</sup>&#8239;They of&shy;ten did not know that they were dis&shy;tract&shy;ed.  Peo&shy;ple called some of these mes&shy;sen&shy;gers proph&shy;ets.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>21</sup>&#8239;Faith&shy;ful mes&shy;sen&shy;gers were found re&shy;gard&shy;less of time, place, cul&shy;ture, sta&shy;tus or re&shy;li&shy;gion in&shy;to which they had been born.
    <sup>22</sup>&#8239;The Par&shy;ents knew that dif&shy;fer&shy;ent mes&shy;sen&shy;gers would help dif&shy;fer&shy;ent chil&shy;dren to pro&shy;gress, so they in&shy;vit&shy;ed mes&shy;sen&shy;gers of all kinds.
    <sup>23</sup>&#8239;The es&shy;sence of these mes&shy;sages has been sta&shy;ble, while the de&shy;tails var&shy;y to ac&shy;com&shy;mo&shy;date mor&shy;tal bi&shy;as.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>24</sup>&#8239;The Par&shy;ents re&shy;main in&shy;volved in and mind&shy;ful of their chil&shy;dren&#x02BC;s lives.
    <sup>25</sup>&#8239;Their in&shy;volve&shy;ment con&shy;sists main&shy;ly in delivering in&shy;for&shy;ma&shy;tion to their chil&shy;dren when they need it and re&shy;quest it.
    <sup>26</sup>&#8239;Phys&shy;i&shy;cal in&shy;ter&shy;ven&shy;tion is rare.
    <sup>27</sup>&#8239;Com&shy;pul&shy;sion is ab&shy;sent.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>28</sup>&#8239;Up&shy;on death, the Par&shy;ents wel&shy;come each child home.
    <sup>29</sup>&#8239;The child, now wis&shy;er, re&shy;ceives an e&shy;ter&shy;nal re&shy;ward cal&shy;cu&shy;lat&shy;ed to bring them sat&shy;is&shy;fac&shy;tion and joy ac&shy;cord&shy;ing to who they have be&shy;come.
