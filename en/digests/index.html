<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>6</sup>&#8239;Grat&shy;i&shy;tude: Stand with your eyes clos&shy;ed and your face turned to&shy;ward the sky un&shy;til you are tran&shy;quil.
    <sup>7</sup>&#8239;Re&shy;cite, <q>God in heav&shy;en, I thank you for life, air to breathe, qui&shy;et places, and the a&shy;bil&shy;i&shy;ty to choose;

    <sup>9</sup>&#8239;In your own words, ex&shy;press heart&shy;felt grat&shy;i&shy;tude to God.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>10</sup>&#8239;Con&shy;fes&shy;sion: Bow, eyes closed, hands on knees, face down&shy;ward.
    <sup>11</sup>&#8239;Re&shy;cite, <q>God in heav&shy;en, I strive to keep the Priorities, to bal&shy;ance the Vir&shy;tues, and to learn from my fail&shy;ures when I don&#x02BC;t.
    <sup>12</sup>&#8239;I want to be more faith&shy;ful.
    <sup>13</sup>&#8239;I fall short in these ways.</q>
    <sup>14</sup>&#8239;In your own words, con&shy;fess to God your fail&shy;ures, weaknesses, and ways you need to im&shy;prove.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>15</sup>&#8239;Pe&shy;ti&shy;tion: Squat, arms out&shy;stretched, hands cupped to form a bowl, your face for&shy;ward.
    <sup>16</sup>&#8239;Re&shy;cite, <q>God in heav&shy;en, you have giv&shy;en me a beau&shy;ti&shy;ful world to live in, mes&shy;sen&shy;gers to teach me, and guid&shy;ance when I ask.
    <sup>17</sup>&#8239;Hear my pray&shy;er.</q>

</p>


<h2 id="parables">Par&shy;a&shy;bles</h2>
<p>
    <sup>1:1</sup>&#8239;An op&shy;tom&shy;e&shy;trist ar&shy;rived in a vil&shy;lage.
    <sup>2</sup>&#8239;The res&shy;i&shy;dents each asked him for help correcting their vi&shy;sion.
    <sup>3</sup>&#8239;He skill&shy;ful&shy;ly crafted glass&shy;es for each pa&shy;tient;
    <sup>4</sup>&#8239;a dif&shy;fer&shy;ent pre&shy;scrip&shy;tion ac&shy;cord&shy;ing to each per&shy;son&#x02BC;s needs.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>1:5</sup>&#8239;Some peo&shy;ple dis&shy;cov&shy;ered that the op&shy;tom&shy;e&shy;trist had giv&shy;en them the same pre&shy;scrip&shy;tion as a neigh&shy;bor.  These peo&shy;ple could swap glass&shy;es with one an&shy;oth&shy;er and still see clear&shy;ly.
    <sup>6</sup>&#8239;How&shy;ev&shy;er, swap&shy;ping glass&shy;es with oth&shy;ers blurred and dis&shy;tort&shy;ed their vi&shy;sion.
    <sup>7</sup>&#8239;Those with i&shy;den&shy;ti&shy;cal pre&shy;scrip&shy;tions gath&shy;ered to&shy;geth&shy;er, say&shy;ing a&shy;mong them&shy;selves,
    <sup>8</sup>&#8239;<q>The op&shy;tom&shy;e&shy;trist gave us the true pre&shy;scrip&shy;tion.  Oth&shy;er pre&shy;scrip&shy;tions are con&shy;fus&shy;ing and mis&shy;tak&shy;en. If eve&shy;ry&shy;one were to wear our pre&shy;scrip&shy;tion, they would see clear&shy;ly just like we do.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>1:9</sup>&#8239;So it is with the re&shy;li&shy;gions of the world.
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>2:1</sup>&#8239;A young child asks his moth&shy;er, <q>How is a ba&shy;by made?</q>
    <sup>2</sup>&#8239;Know&shy;ing the child&#x02BC;s ru&shy;di&shy;men&shy;ta&shy;ry un&shy;der&shy;stand&shy;ing, she re&shy;sponds,
    <sup>3</sup>&#8239;<q>The fa&shy;ther places a seed in the moth&shy;er&#x02BC;s bel&shy;ly.  The moth&shy;er nourishes that seed and it grows in&shy;to a ba&shy;by.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:4</sup>&#8239;So it is when God teaches us.
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>3:1</sup>&#8239;A king had two vaults filled with treas&shy;ure, each pro&shy;tected by its own lock.
    <sup>2</sup>&#8239;The king said that who&shy;ev&shy;er o&shy;pened a vault could have the treas&shy;ure in&shy;side.
    <sup>3</sup>&#8239;Two men sought the treas&shy;ure.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>3:4</sup>&#8239;The first man turned the di&shy;als of the lock.
    <sup>5</sup>&#8239;He lis&shy;tened care&shy;ful&shy;ly as the mech&shy;an&shy;ism moved in&shy;side.
    <sup>6</sup>&#8239;He no&shy;ticed pat&shy;terns of sound and vi&shy;bra&shy;tion with&shy;in the di&shy;als.
    <sup>7</sup>&#8239;Af&shy;ter man&shy;y days of per&shy;sis&shy;tence and stud&shy;y, he dis&shy;cov&shy;ered the com&shy;bi&shy;na&shy;tion and un&shy;locked the vault.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>3:8</sup>&#8239;The sec&shy;ond man of&shy;fered to be the king&#x02BC;s serv&shy;ant.
    <sup>9</sup>&#8239;He lis&shy;tened care&shy;ful&shy;ly to the king&#x02BC;s wishes, and ex&shy;e&shy;cut&shy;ed them faith&shy;ful&shy;ly.
    <sup>10</sup>&#8239;He no&shy;ticed pat&shy;terns a&shy;mong the king&#x02BC;s re&shy;quests and an&shy;tic&shy;i&shy;pat&shy;ed his wishes.
    <sup>11</sup>&#8239;Af&shy;ter man&shy;y days of per&shy;sis&shy;tence and serv&shy;ice, the sec&shy;ond man asked the king for the com&shy;bi&shy;na&shy;tion and re&shy;ceived it.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>3:13</sup>&#8239;Both men re&shy;ceived treas&shy;ure.
    <sup>14</sup>&#8239;So it is with knowl&shy;edge.
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>4:1</sup>&#8239;There were two lakes.
    <sup>2</sup>&#8239;The first lake said to him&shy;self, <q>I will re&shy;tain eve&shy;ry drop of wa&shy;ter that flows in&shy;to me so that I can be great.</q>
    <sup>3</sup>&#8239;His wa&shy;ters be&shy;came salt&shy;y and pu&shy;trid.
    <sup>4</sup>&#8239;His fish died and the plants a&shy;long his shore wilted.
    <sup>5</sup>&#8239;An&shy;i&shy;mals and trav&shy;el&shy;ers a&shy;voided him.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>4:6</sup>&#8239;The sec&shy;ond lake said to him&shy;self, <q>I want to pros&shy;per all life on the moun&shy;tain be&shy;low me. I will re&shy;tain a mod&shy;est pool for my&shy;self then al&shy;low each drop to pass down the riv&shy;er to those who might use it.</q>
    <sup>7</sup>&#8239;His wa&shy;ters be&shy;came clean and sweet.
    <sup>8</sup>&#8239;His fish grew large and the plants a&shy;long his shore pros&shy;pered.
    <sup>9</sup>&#8239;An&shy;i&shy;mals and trav&shy;el&shy;ers came from a&shy;far to en&shy;joy his splen&shy;dor.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>4:10</sup>&#8239;So it is with all as&shy;sets.
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>5:1</sup>&#8239;Rain, fresh&shy;ly fall&shy;en from a cloud, is clean and good to drink.
    <sup>2</sup>&#8239;As it flows down moun&shy;tains and a&shy;cross plains, it be&shy;comes soiled and bit&shy;ter.
    <sup>3</sup>&#8239;The sun must ex&shy;tract pure wa&shy;ter from the sea a&shy;gain, leav&shy;ing impurities be&shy;hind, to pro&shy;duce fresh rain once more.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>5:4</sup>&#8239;So it is with mes&shy;sages from heav&shy;en.
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>6:1</sup>&#8239;A horse, a dol&shy;phin, and an ea&shy;gle each con&shy;sume their own kind of nour&shy;ish&shy;ment,
    <sup>2</sup>&#8239;and yet each grows to full stat&shy;ure and maj&shy;es&shy;ty.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>6:3</sup>&#8239;So it is with spir&shy;it&shy;u&shy;al&shy;i&shy;ty.
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>7:1</sup>&#8239;A child asks his moth&shy;er, <q>Please get me a cup from the top shelf.</q>
    <sup>2</sup>&#8239;The moth&shy;er reaches the cup for him.
    <sup>3</sup>&#8239;A grown man asks his moth&shy;er, <q>Please get me a cup from the top shelf.</q>
    <sup>4</sup>&#8239;She re&shy;sponds, <q>You can reach it your&shy;self.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>7:5</sup>&#8239;So it is with pray&shy;er.
</p>

    <sup>8:1</sup>&#8239;A man mixed one meas&shy;ure of sug&shy;ar and the juice from one lem&shy;on in&shy;to 2,000 meas&shy;ures of wa&shy;ter,
    <sup>2</sup>&#8239;then served it to his guests as lem&shy;on&shy;ade.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>8:3</sup>&#8239;So it is with man&shy;y re&shy;li&shy;gions.
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>9:1</sup>&#8239;A man brought eggs home from the mar&shy;ket.
    <sup>2</sup>&#8239;Up&shy;on ar&shy;riv&shy;ing, he an&shy;nounced, <q>I brought home one doz&shy;en eggs.</q>
    <sup>3</sup>&#8239;His wife said, <q>No you didn&#x02BC;t. You brought home twelve in&shy;di&shy;vid&shy;u&shy;al eggs.</q>
    <sup>4</sup>&#8239;A son said, <q>You&#x02BC;re both wrong. There are clear&shy;ly three rows of four eggs each.</q>
    <sup>5</sup>&#8239;A daugh&shy;ter dis&shy;a&shy;greed, <q>Not at all. There are ac&shy;tu&shy;al&shy;ly four col&shy;umns of three eggs each.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>9:6</sup>&#8239;So it is with dis&shy;cus&shy;sions a&shy;bout God&#x02BC;s na&shy;ture and meth&shy;ods.
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>10:1</sup>&#8239;A man de&shy;cid&shy;ed to climb a moun&shy;tain.
    <sup>2</sup>&#8239;He fixed his gaze per&shy;ma&shy;nent&shy;ly on the sum&shy;mit and be&shy;gan hik&shy;ing.
    <sup>3</sup>&#8239;He tripped o&shy;ver un&shy;seen rocks at his feet,
    <sup>4</sup>&#8239;and was un&shy;a&shy;ble to reach the moun&shy;tain top.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>10:5</sup>&#8239;An&shy;oth&shy;er man chose to climb the same moun&shy;tain.
    <sup>6</sup>&#8239;He gazed per&shy;ma&shy;nent&shy;ly at his feet, to a&shy;void the er&shy;rors of the first man, and be&shy;gan hik&shy;ing.
    <sup>7</sup>&#8239;With&shy;out trip&shy;ping once, he wan&shy;dered off in&shy;to a val&shy;ley,
    <sup>8</sup>&#8239;and was un&shy;a&shy;ble to reach the moun&shy;tain top.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>10:9</sup>&#8239;So it is when bal&shy;anc&shy;ing vir&shy;tues.
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>11:1</sup>&#8239;A man no&shy;ticed a few small pieces of a jig&shy;saw puz&shy;zle rest&shy;ing on a ta&shy;ble.
    <sup>2</sup>&#8239;He wanted to as&shy;sem&shy;ble the new puz&shy;zle, but there weren&#x02BC;t e&shy;nough pieces to com&shy;plete the task.  He al&shy;so didn&#x02BC;t know how the puz&shy;zle should look when it was fin&shy;ished.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>11:3</sup>&#8239;From time to time a new piece would ap&shy;pear on the ta&shy;ble, but there still weren&#x02BC;t e&shy;nough to guess the puz&shy;zle&#x02BC;s fi&shy;nal form.
    <sup>4</sup>&#8239;One day, a sketch of the fin&shy;ished puz&shy;zle ap&shy;peared next to the scat&shy;tered pieces.
    <sup>5</sup>&#8239;The man be&shy;gan to as&shy;sem&shy;ble what he had on&shy;ly to re&shy;al&shy;ize that some pieces were still mis&shy;sing.
    <sup>6</sup>&#8239;He re&shy;turned each day, some&shy;times to find a new piece, some&shy;times to find an old piece that had been ac&shy;ci&shy;den&shy;tal&shy;ly bumped loose, and some&shy;times to find no changes at all.
    <sup>7</sup>&#8239;In time, all the pieces ar&shy;rived and he gath&shy;ered the puz&shy;zle to&shy;geth&shy;er in&shy;to its beau&shy;ti&shy;ful, com&shy;plete form.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>11:8</sup>&#8239;So it is with per&shy;son&shy;al rev&shy;e&shy;la&shy;tion.
