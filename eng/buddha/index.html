                <sup>1</sup>&#8239;Our life is shaped by our mind: it is ruled by our mind, it is made by our mind. If one speaks or acts with an evil mind, suf­fer­ing follows him, as the wheel follows the foot of the ox that draws the cart.
                <sup>2</sup>&#8239;Our life is shaped by our mind: it is ruled by our mind, it is made by our mind. If one speaks or acts with a pure mind, hap­pi­ness follows him, like a shad­ow that nev­er leaves him.

                <sup>4</sup>&#8239;“He insulted me, hit me, defeated me, robbed me.” In those who do not har­bor such thoughts, ha­tred will cease.
                <sup>5</sup>&#8239;For ha­tred nev­er ceases by ha­tred. Ha­tred ceases by love. This is an e­ter­nal law.
                <sup>6</sup>&#8239;Some do not re­al­ize that we all must die, but those who do re­al­ize it cease their quarrels at once.

            <p>
                <sup>7</sup>&#8239;Just as the wind throws down a weak tree, so will the temp­ter o­ver­throw him who fo­cus­es on­ly on pleasures, his sen­ses un­con­trolled, im­mod­er­ate in his food, i­dle, and weak.
                <sup>8</sup>&#8239;Just as the wind can­not throw down a rock­y moun­tain, so the temp­ter will not o­ver­throw him who does not fo­cus on pleasures, his sen­ses well con­trolled, mod­er­ate in his food, faith­ful and strong.
            </p>
            <p>
                <sup>9</sup>&#8239;He who puts on the monkʼs yel­low robe with­out hav­ing cleansed him­self from sin, who disregards self-control and truth, is un­wor­thy of the robe.
                <sup>10</sup>&#8239;But he who has cleansed him­self from sin, is well grounded in vir­tues, and regards self-control and truth, is in­deed wor­thy of the robe.
            </p>
            <p>
                <sup>11</sup>&#8239;They who mis­take the triv­i­al for the es­sen­tial, and the es­sen­tial for the triv­i­al, nev­er ar­rive at the es­sen­tial, but fol­low vain desires.
                <sup>12</sup>&#8239;They who know the es­sen­tial as es­sen­tial, and the triv­i­al as triv­i­al, ar­rive at the es­sen­tial, and fol­low true desires.

            <p>
                <sup>13</sup>&#8239;Just as rain seeps through a poor­ly tha­tched house, pas­sion seeps through an undeveloped mind.
                <sup>14</sup>&#8239;Just as rain can­not seep through a well tha­tched house, pas­sion can­not seep through a well de­vel­oped mind.

            <p>
                <sup>15</sup>&#8239;The evil­do­er grieves in this world, and in the next. He grieves in both. He grieves and suffers when he sees the evil of his own work.
                <sup>16</sup>&#8239;The vir­tu­ous man delights in this world, and in the next. He delights in both. He delights and rejoices when he sees the pu­ri­ty of his own work.
            </p>
            <p>
                <sup>17</sup>&#8239;The evil­do­er suffers in this world, and in the next. He suffers in both. He suffers when he thinks of the evil he has done. He suffers more when go­ing to the next world.
                <sup>18</sup>&#8239;The vir­tu­ous man is hap­py in this world, and in the next. He is hap­py in both. He is hap­py when he thinks of the good he has done. He is hap­pi­er still when go­ing to the next world.
            </p>
            <p>
                <sup>19</sup>&#8239;The thought­less man, if he recites man­y scriptures, but does not do what they say, has no share in the blessings of the ho­ly life, but is like a cow­herd counting the cows of others.
                <sup>20</sup>&#8239;He who recites on­ly a few scriptures, but does what they say, hav­ing for­sak­en lust and ha­tred and de­lu­sion, possesses true knowl­edge and se­ren­i­ty of mind, car­ing for noth­ing in this world or that to come, he shares in the blessings of the ho­ly life.

            <p>
                <sup>21</sup>&#8239;Vig­i­lance is the path to sal­va­tion. Care­less­ness is the path to death. Those who are vig­i­lant do not die. Those who are care­less are as if dead al­read­y.
                <sup>22</sup>&#8239;The wise, hav­ing un­der­stood this clear­ly, de­light in vig­i­lance, and re­joice in the knowl­edge of the no­ble ones.
                <sup>23</sup>&#8239;These wise peo­ple, meditative, stead­fast­ly per­se­ver­ing, at­tain to sal­va­tion, the highest hap­pi­ness.
            </p>
            <p>
                <sup>24</sup>&#8239;If a vig­i­lant per­son is en­er­get­ic, if he is mind­ful, if his deeds are pure, if he acts with con­sid­er­a­tion, if he has self-control, and is right­eous, then his glo­ry will in­crease.
                <sup>25</sup>&#8239;By ef­fort, by vig­i­lance, by dis­ci­pline and self-control, the wise man may make for him­self an is­land which no flood can o­ver­whelm.
            </p>
            <p>
                <sup>26</sup>&#8239;The fool­ish and ig­no­rant in­dulge in care­less­ness. The wise man keeps vig­i­lance as his great­est treas­ure.
                <sup>27</sup>&#8239;Do not give way to care­less­ness or to the en­joy­ment of sen­su­al pleasures. He who is vig­i­lant and meditative, obtains am­ple joy.
            </p>
            <p>
                <sup>28</sup>&#8239;When the wise man drives a­way care­less­ness by vig­i­lance, he climbs the tow­er of wis­dom and looks down up­on the fools. With­out suf­fer­ing, he looks at the suf­fer­ing crowd, as one that stands on a moun­tain looks at them that stand on the ground be­low.
            </p>
            <p>
                <sup>29</sup>&#8239;Vig­i­lant a­mong the care­less, a­wake a­mong the sleep­ing, the wise man ad­vanc­es like a fast horse, leav­ing the weak be­hind.
                <sup>30</sup>&#8239;Vig­i­lance is al­ways praised; care­less­ness is al­ways de­spised.
            </p>
            <p>
                <sup>31</sup>&#8239;The monk who delights in vig­i­lance, who looks with fear at care­less­ness, moves a­bout like fire, burn­ing all fetters, small and large.
                <sup>32</sup>&#8239;The monk who delights in vig­i­lance, who looks with fear at care­less­ness, can­not fall a­way. He is close to sal­va­tion.

            <p>
                <sup>33</sup>&#8239;Just as a fletch­er straightens his ar­row, a wise man straightens his trem­bling and un­stead­y mind, which is dif­fi­cult to guard, dif­fi­cult to re­strain.
            </p>
            <p>
                <sup>34</sup>&#8239;Just as a fish quivers when tak­en from its home in the wa­ter and thrown on land, our mind trem­bles all o­ver to es­cape the in­flu­ence of the temp­ter.
            </p>
            <p>
                <sup>35</sup>&#8239;It is good to tame the mind, which is dif­fi­cult to tame and flight­y, rush­ing wher­ev­er it wants. A tamed mind brings hap­pi­ness.
                <sup>36</sup>&#8239;Let the wise man guard his mind, for it is sub­tle and e­lu­sive, and it rushes wher­ev­er it wants. A guard­ed mind brings hap­pi­ness.
            </p>
            <p>
                <sup>37</sup>&#8239;The mind wanders far, moves a­bout a­lone, is with­out a bod­y, and hides in the ca­ve of the heart. Those who bri­dle it are free from the bonds of the temp­ter.
            </p>
            <p>
                <sup>38</sup>&#8239;If a manʼs mind is un­stead­y, if he does not know the true law, and if his faith is troubled, then his knowl­edge will nev­er be per­fect.
                <sup>39</sup>&#8239;If a manʼs mind is free from pas­sion, if his mind is free from ill will, if he is un­af­fect­ed by good and evil, then there is dan­ger for him.
            </p>
            <p>
                <sup>40</sup>&#8239;Know­ing that this bod­y is frag­ile like a clay pot, and securing this mind like a for­tress, at­tack the temp­ter with the sword of knowl­edge. Then guard what is won with­out feel­ing at­tach­ment to it.
                <sup>41</sup>&#8239;Soon, this bod­y will lie on the ground, discarded, with­out con­scious­ness, like a use­less log.
            </p>
            <p>
                <sup>42</sup>&#8239;What­ev­er an en­e­my might do to an en­e­my, or a foe to a foe, a wrong­ly di­rect­ed mind can do to you e­ven worse.
                <sup>43</sup>&#8239;What­ev­er a moth­er, a fa­ther, or any oth­er rel­a­tive might do for you, a well di­rect­ed mind can do for you e­ven more.

                <sup>45</sup>&#8239;A dis­ci­ple will o­ver­come this earth, and the world of the dead, and the world of the gods. A dis­ci­ple will choose the well taught path of vir­tue, as an ex­pert flo­rist chooses the right flow­er.

            <p>
                <sup>47</sup>&#8239;As a flood sweeps a­way a sleep­ing vil­lage, so death sweeps a­way a man who is im­mersed in gath­er­ing flowers, his mind dis­tract­ed.
                <sup>48</sup>&#8239;Death subdues a man who is im­mersed in gath­er­ing flowers, his mind dis­tract­ed, be­fore he is sa­ti­at­ed in his pleasures.
                <sup>49</sup>&#8239;As a bee collects nec­tar and departs with­out dam­ag­ing the flow­er or its col­or or its scent, so should a sage col­lect alms in a vil­lage.
