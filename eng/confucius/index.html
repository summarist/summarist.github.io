    <p>
    <sup>1:1</sup>&#8239;Isn&#x02BC;t it a pleas&shy;ure to learn some&shy;thing, then to ap&shy;ply it at the right time?  Isn&#x02BC;t it a joy to have friends come from a&shy;far?  Isn&#x02BC;t he a su&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;or man who takes no of&shy;fense when his mer&shy;its are ig&shy;nored?
</p>

<p>
    <sup>1:3</sup>&#8239;Cun&shy;ning words and an in&shy;gra&shy;ti&shy;at&shy;ing ap&shy;pear&shy;ance rare&shy;ly ac&shy;com&shy;pa&shy;ny be&shy;nev&shy;o&shy;lence.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>1:5</sup>&#8239;The Way to guide a state of a thou&shy;sand char&shy;i&shy;ots: be at&shy;ten&shy;tive to busi&shy;ness and trust&shy;wor&shy;thy; be fru&shy;gal in ex&shy;pend&shy;i&shy;tures and love your fel&shy;low men; on&shy;ly mo&shy;bi&shy;lize the com&shy;mon peo&shy;ple at the prop&shy;er time of year.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>1:6</sup>&#8239;A young man should re&shy;spect his par&shy;ents at home, re&shy;spect his el&shy;ders a&shy;broad, say lit&shy;tle but be trust&shy;wor&shy;thy, love the peo&shy;ple at large but be in&shy;ti&shy;mate with the be&shy;nev&shy;o&shy;lent. If he still has en&shy;er&shy;gy to spare, let him stud&shy;y lit&shy;er&shy;a&shy;ture.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>1:10</sup>&#8239;Ziqin asked Zigong, <q>When Con&shy;fu&shy;cius ar&shy;rives in a coun&shy;try, he al&shy;ways learns a&shy;bout its gov&shy;ern&shy;ment.  Does he seek out this in&shy;for&shy;ma&shy;tion or is it giv&shy;en to him?</q>  Zigong replied, <q>Con&shy;fu&shy;cius ob&shy;tains it by be&shy;ing cor&shy;dial, up&shy;right, re&shy;spect&shy;ful, fru&shy;gal, and def&shy;er&shy;en&shy;tial. He seeks it dif&shy;fer&shy;ent&shy;ly than oth&shy;er men do.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>1:14</sup>&#8239;A su&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;or man seeks nei&shy;ther a full stom&shy;ach nor com&shy;fort&shy;a&shy;ble lodg&shy;ings. He is dil&shy;i&shy;gent in his ac&shy;tions but cau&shy;tious in his speech.  He as&shy;so&shy;ci&shy;ates with those who know the Way in or&shy;der to be put right.  Such a man may be said to love learn&shy;ing.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>1:16</sup>&#8239;Don&#x02BC;t wor&shy;ry that men don&#x02BC;t rec&shy;og&shy;nize your mer&shy;its; wor&shy;ry that you don&#x02BC;t rec&shy;og&shy;nize theirs.

<p>
    <sup>2:1</sup>&#8239;He who gov&shy;erns by vir&shy;tue is like the North Star: it stays in its place while all the oth&shy;er stars pay hom&shy;age to it.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:3</sup>&#8239;If you lead the peo&shy;ple with e&shy;dicts and keep them or&shy;der&shy;ly with pun&shy;ish&shy;ments, they will e&shy;vade the pun&shy;ish&shy;ment and have no sense of shame. If you lead them with vir&shy;tue and keep them or&shy;der&shy;ly with pro&shy;pri&shy;e&shy;ty, they will have a sense of shame and or&shy;der them&shy;selves.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:6</sup>&#8239;Meng Wubo asked a&shy;bout fil&shy;ial pi&shy;e&shy;ty. Con&shy;fu&shy;cius said, <q>Give your par&shy;ents noth&shy;ing to wor&shy;ry a&shy;bout oth&shy;er than ill&shy;ness.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:7</sup>&#8239;Ziyou asked a&shy;bout fil&shy;ial pi&shy;e&shy;ty. Con&shy;fu&shy;cius said, <q>Now&shy;a&shy;days fil&shy;ial pi&shy;e&shy;ty on&shy;ly means be&shy;ing a&shy;ble to feed your par&shy;ents.  But e&shy;ven dogs and hors&shy;es re&shy;ceive this much care.  With&shy;out re&shy;spect, what&#x02BC;s the dif&shy;fer&shy;ence?</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:8</sup>&#8239;Zixia asked a&shy;bout fil&shy;ial pi&shy;e&shy;ty. Con&shy;fu&shy;cius said, <q>It&#x02BC;s the ex&shy;pres&shy;sion on your face that&#x02BC;s dif&shy;fi&shy;cult to man&shy;age.  It&#x02BC;s not fil&shy;ial pi&shy;e&shy;ty mere&shy;ly for the young to shoul&shy;der the bur&shy;den when there is work to do, and to de&shy;fer to their el&shy;ders when there is wine and food a&shy;vail&shy;a&shy;ble.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:10</sup>&#8239;Look at the means a man em&shy;ploys.  Ob&shy;serve his mo&shy;tives.  Ex&shy;am&shy;ine what gives him com&shy;fort.  How can a man con&shy;ceal his char&shy;ac&shy;ter?
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:11</sup>&#8239;If a man learns the new by reviewing the old, he is wor&shy;thy to be a teach&shy;er.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:13</sup>&#8239;A su&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;or man acts be&shy;fore he speaks, and then speaks ac&shy;cord&shy;ing to his ac&shy;tions.
    <sup>14</sup>&#8239;A su&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;or man is in&shy;clu&shy;sive and not par&shy;ti&shy;san, while an in&shy;fe&shy;ri&shy;or man is the op&shy;po&shy;site.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:15</sup>&#8239;Learn&shy;ing with&shy;out think&shy;ing is a waste. Think&shy;ing with&shy;out learn&shy;ing is dan&shy;ger&shy;ous.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:17</sup>&#8239;Knowl&shy;edge is to know when you know some&shy;thing, and to know when you don&#x02BC;t.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:18</sup>&#8239;Zizhang was stud&shy;y&shy;ing in or&shy;der to get an of&shy;fi&shy;cial po&shy;si&shy;tion. Con&shy;fu&shy;cius said, <q>If you lis&shy;ten much, put a&shy;side what is doubt&shy;ful, and speak cau&shy;tious&shy;ly a&shy;bout the rest, you will make few mis&shy;takes.  If you ob&shy;serve much, put a&shy;side what is per&shy;i&shy;lous, and act cau&shy;tious&shy;ly on the rest, you will have few re&shy;grets.  Few mis&shy;takes in speech, few re&shy;grets in ac&shy;tion: an of&shy;fi&shy;cial po&shy;si&shy;tion will fol&shy;low.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:19</sup>&#8239;If you raise up the straight and place them o&shy;ver the crook&shy;ed, the peo&shy;ple will fol&shy;low you.  If you raise up the crook&shy;ed and place them o&shy;ver the straight, the peo&shy;ple will not fol&shy;low you.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:20</sup>&#8239;Ji Kangzi asked, <q>How can I en&shy;cour&shy;age the peo&shy;ple to be re&shy;spect&shy;ful, loy&shy;al, and dil&shy;i&shy;gent?</q>  Con&shy;fu&shy;cius said, <q>Ap&shy;proach them with dig&shy;ni&shy;ty then they will be re&shy;spect&shy;ful.  Be fil&shy;ial and kind then they will be loy&shy;al.  Raise up the good and in&shy;struct the in&shy;com&shy;pe&shy;tent then they will be dil&shy;i&shy;gent.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:21</sup>&#8239;Some&shy;one asked Con&shy;fu&shy;cius, <q>Why don&#x02BC;t you en&shy;gage in gov&shy;ern&shy;ment?</q> Con&shy;fu&shy;cius said, <q>The Book of Doc&shy;u&shy;ments says, <q>Just by be&shy;ing fil&shy;ial and be&shy;ing friend&shy;ly to your broth&shy;ers you will have an ef&shy;fect on gov&shy;ern&shy;ment.</q>  Since this is al&shy;so en&shy;gag&shy;ing in gov&shy;ern&shy;ment, why do I need to <q>en&shy;gage in gov&shy;ern&shy;ment</q>?</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:22</sup>&#8239;I don&#x02BC;t know what to do with an un&shy;trust&shy;wor&shy;thy man.  How can you pull a wag&shy;on that&#x02BC;s mis&shy;sing its yoke pin?
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:24</sup>&#8239;To see what is right and not to do it is a lack of cour&shy;age.
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>3:3</sup>&#8239;If a man is not be&shy;nev&shy;o&shy;lent, what can he do with pro&shy;pri&shy;e&shy;ty?
</p>

<p>
    <sup>3:4</sup>&#8239;In rit&shy;u&shy;al, pre&shy;fer fru&shy;gal&shy;i&shy;ty to ex&shy;trav&shy;a&shy;gance.  In fu&shy;ner&shy;als, pre&shy;fer grief to for&shy;mal&shy;i&shy;ty.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>3:12</sup>&#8239;If I don&#x02BC;t par&shy;tic&shy;i&shy;pate in a sac&shy;ri&shy;fice, it&#x02BC;s as if I have not sacrificed at all.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>3:15</sup>&#8239;When Con&shy;fu&shy;cius en&shy;tered the Grand Tem&shy;ple, he asked ques&shy;tions a&shy;bout eve&shy;ry&shy;thing. Some&shy;one re&shy;marked, <q>Who says that Con&shy;fu&shy;cius knows a&shy;bout rit&shy;u&shy;al? When visiting the Grand Tem&shy;ple, he asked ques&shy;tions a&shy;bout eve&shy;ry&shy;thing.</q> Con&shy;fu&shy;cius, hear&shy;ing this, said, <q>This is the rit&shy;u&shy;al.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>3:21</sup>&#8239;Don&#x02BC;t ex&shy;plain a&shy;way what is al&shy;read&shy;y done.  Don&#x02BC;t ar&shy;gue a&shy;gainst what is al&shy;read&shy;y ac&shy;com&shy;plished.  Don&#x02BC;t as&shy;sign blame for what is al&shy;read&shy;y past.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>3:26</sup>&#8239;Hold&shy;ing a high po&shy;si&shy;tion with&shy;out tol&shy;er&shy;ance, per&shy;form&shy;ing rit&shy;u&shy;al with&shy;out rev&shy;er&shy;ence, joining a fu&shy;ner&shy;al with&shy;out grief: how can I look at such things?
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>4:1</sup>&#8239;It is be&shy;nev&shy;o&shy;lence that makes a neigh&shy;bor&shy;hood beau&shy;ti&shy;ful.  How can a man be con&shy;sid&shy;ered wise if he chooses not to re&shy;side a&shy;mong be&shy;nev&shy;o&shy;lence?
</p>

<p>
    <sup>4:2</sup>&#8239;Those who lack be&shy;nev&shy;o&shy;lence can en&shy;dure nei&shy;ther ad&shy;ver&shy;si&shy;ty nor en&shy;joy&shy;ment for long. The be&shy;nev&shy;o&shy;lent are con&shy;tent with be&shy;nev&shy;o&shy;lence.  The wise cul&shy;ti&shy;vate be&shy;nev&shy;o&shy;lence for its ad&shy;van&shy;tage.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>4:4</sup>&#8239;If you set your heart on be&shy;nev&shy;o&shy;lence, you will be free from evil.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>4:5</sup>&#8239;All men de&shy;sire wealth and hon&shy;or, but if they are ob&shy;tained by not fol&shy;low&shy;ing the Way, they should not be kept.  All men hate pov&shy;er&shy;ty and dis&shy;grace, but if they can&#x02BC;t be a&shy;voided by fol&shy;low&shy;ing the Way, they should not be a&shy;voided.  If a su&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;or man a&shy;ban&shy;dons be&shy;nev&shy;o&shy;lence, how is he wor&shy;thy of that name?  A su&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;or man nev&shy;er leaves be&shy;nev&shy;o&shy;lence e&shy;ven for the space of a sin&shy;gle meal.  In mo&shy;ments of haste, he acts ac&shy;cord&shy;ing to it.  In times of dif&shy;fi&shy;cul&shy;ty, he acts ac&shy;cord&shy;ing to it.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>4:6</sup>&#8239;One who re&shy;al&shy;ly loves be&shy;nev&shy;o&shy;lence puts noth&shy;ing a&shy;bove it.  One who re&shy;al&shy;ly hates what is not be&shy;nev&shy;o&shy;lent would not al&shy;low it to ap&shy;proach him.  Has any&shy;one de&shy;vot&shy;ed all his strength to be&shy;nev&shy;o&shy;lence for a sin&shy;gle day?  I hav&shy;en&#x02BC;t seen any&shy;one who lacked the strength to do so.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>4:7</sup>&#8239;Peo&shy;ple make er&shy;rors ac&shy;cord&shy;ing to the type of per&shy;son they are. Ob&shy;serve their er&shy;rors and you can know their de&shy;gree of be&shy;nev&shy;o&shy;lence.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>4:9</sup>&#8239;A gen&shy;tle&shy;man who sets his heart on the Way, but is a&shy;shamed of poor clothes and poor food, is not worth en&shy;gag&shy;ing in dis&shy;cus&shy;sion.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>4:10</sup>&#8239;When a su&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;or man deals with the world he is not in&shy;var&shy;i&shy;a&shy;bly for or a&shy;gainst any&shy;thing.  He sides with what is right.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>4:11</sup>&#8239;A su&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;or man cherishes vir&shy;tue; an in&shy;fe&shy;ri&shy;or man cherishes land.  A su&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;or man cherishes jus&shy;tice; an in&shy;fe&shy;ri&shy;or man cherishes fa&shy;vors.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>4:12</sup>&#8239;One who acts out of per&shy;son&shy;al prof&shy;it in&shy;curs much re&shy;sent&shy;ment.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>4:14</sup>&#8239;Don&#x02BC;t wor&shy;ry that you have no po&shy;si&shy;tion; wor&shy;ry a&shy;bout what it takes to mer&shy;it one.  Don&#x02BC;t wor&shy;ry that no one knows you;  seek to be worth know&shy;ing.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>4:16</sup>&#8239;A su&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;or man un&shy;der&shy;stands what is right.  An in&shy;fe&shy;ri&shy;or man un&shy;der&shy;stands per&shy;son&shy;al prof&shy;it.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>4:17</sup>&#8239;When you see a wor&shy;thy man, think of be&shy;com&shy;ing his e&shy;qual; when you see an un&shy;wor&shy;thy man, look with&shy;in and ex&shy;am&shy;ine your&shy;self.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>4:18</sup>&#8239;In serv&shy;ing your par&shy;ents, you may ad&shy;mon&shy;ish them gen&shy;tly;  if you see that they don&#x02BC;t fol&shy;low your ad&shy;vice, re&shy;main re&shy;spect&shy;ful, don&#x02BC;t be&shy;come dis&shy;o&shy;be&shy;di&shy;ent, and work with&shy;out complaining.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>4:22</sup>&#8239;The an&shy;cients were re&shy;luc&shy;tant to speak be&shy;cause they would have been a&shy;shamed if their ac&shy;tions didn&#x02BC;t live up to their words.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>4:23</sup>&#8239;One rare&shy;ly miss&shy;es the mark be&shy;cause of self-control.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>4:24</sup>&#8239;A su&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;or man wants to be slow in speech but quick in ac&shy;tion.
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>5:5</sup>&#8239;What is the use of el&shy;o&shy;quence?  Those who give a quick re&shy;tort of&shy;ten in&shy;cur the ha&shy;tred of oth&shy;ers.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>5:10</sup>&#8239;Zai Yu was sleep&shy;ing dur&shy;ing the day. Con&shy;fu&shy;cius said, <q>Rot&shy;ten wood can&shy;not be carved, and a wall of ma&shy;nure can&shy;not be trow&shy;eled. What is the use of scolding Zai Yu?  I used to lis&shy;ten to what peo&shy;ple said and trust them to act ac&shy;cord&shy;ing&shy;ly.  Now I lis&shy;ten to what peo&shy;ple say and watch what they do.  It is be&shy;cause of Zai Yu that I have changed.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>5:11</sup>&#8239;I hav&shy;en&#x02BC;t seen a tru&shy;ly stead&shy;fast man. How can a man who is full of de&shy;sires be stead&shy;fast?
</p>

<p>
    <sup>5:15</sup>&#8239;Kong the Re&shy;fined was men&shy;tal&shy;ly quick, fond of learn&shy;ing, and not a&shy;shamed to ask ques&shy;tions of his in&shy;fe&shy;ri&shy;ors. That&#x02BC;s why he was called <q>Re&shy;fined</q>.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>5:16</sup>&#8239;Zi Chan had four char&shy;ac&shy;ter&shy;is&shy;tics of the Way of a su&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;or man: he was re&shy;spect&shy;ful in his pri&shy;vate con&shy;duct, re&shy;spect&shy;ful in serv&shy;ing his su&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;ors, gen&shy;er&shy;ous in car&shy;ing for the peo&shy;ple, and just in employing the peo&shy;ple.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>5:17</sup>&#8239;Yang Ping Zhong ex&shy;celled in his re&shy;la&shy;tions with oth&shy;ers.  E&shy;ven af&shy;ter long ac&shy;quaint&shy;ance he con&shy;tin&shy;ued to treat them with re&shy;spect.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>5:20</sup>&#8239;Ji Wen Zi al&shy;ways thought three times be&shy;fore act&shy;ing.  Hear&shy;ing this, Con&shy;fu&shy;cius said, <q>Twice is e&shy;nough.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>5:23</sup>&#8239;Bo Yi and Shu Qi did not re&shy;mem&shy;ber old griev&shy;ances, so there was lit&shy;tle re&shy;sent&shy;ment a&shy;gainst them.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>5:25</sup>&#8239;Glib talk, an in&shy;gra&shy;ti&shy;at&shy;ing ex&shy;pres&shy;sion, and ob&shy;se&shy;qui&shy;ous con&shy;duct: I am a&shy;shamed of such be&shy;hav&shy;ior.  Act&shy;ing friend&shy;ly to&shy;wards some&shy;one while concealing your re&shy;sent&shy;ment for them: I am a&shy;shamed of such be&shy;hav&shy;ior.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>5:26</sup>&#8239;My heart&#x02BC;s de&shy;sire is to bring peace to the old, to share trust with my friends, and to cher&shy;ish the young.

    <sup>6:3</sup>&#8239;Yanhui loved learn&shy;ing. He nev&shy;er took his an&shy;ger out on oth&shy;ers, and nev&shy;er made the same mis&shy;take twice.
    <sup>11</sup>&#8239;How ad&shy;mi&shy;ra&shy;ble he was! He lived on a bowlful of rice to eat, a la&shy;dle&shy;ful of wa&shy;ter to drink, and a hov&shy;el for shel&shy;ter. Oth&shy;ers could not have en&shy;dured such mis&shy;er&shy;y, yet Yanhui&#x02BC;s joy was un&shy;changed.

    <sup>6:12</sup>&#8239;Ran Qiu said, <q>It&#x02BC;s not that I don&#x02BC;t en&shy;joy your Way, but I don&#x02BC;t have the strength to fol&shy;low it.</q>  Con&shy;fu&shy;cius said, <q>Those who don&#x02BC;t have the strength col&shy;lapse a&shy;long the way, but you have drawn a line be&shy;fore starting.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>6:15</sup>&#8239;Meng Zhifan was not boast&shy;ful.  He once held the rear dur&shy;ing a re&shy;treat.  As they reached the cit&shy;y gate, he whipped his horse, say&shy;ing, <q>It&#x02BC;s not that I dared to be last, on&shy;ly that my horse wouldn&#x02BC;t go.</q>

    <sup>6:18</sup>&#8239;When nat&shy;u&shy;ral dis&shy;po&shy;si&shy;tion pre&shy;vails o&shy;ver re&shy;fine&shy;ment, you get a sav&shy;age.  When re&shy;fine&shy;ment pre&shy;vails o&shy;ver nat&shy;u&shy;ral dis&shy;po&shy;si&shy;tion, you get a pe&shy;dan&shy;tic clerk.  When nat&shy;u&shy;ral dis&shy;po&shy;si&shy;tion and re&shy;fine&shy;ment are prop&shy;er&shy;ly blend&shy;ed, you get a su&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;or man.

<p>
    <sup>6:28</sup>&#8239;If I have done wrong, may Heav&shy;en de&shy;test and a&shy;ban&shy;don me!
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>7:2</sup>&#8239;It&#x02BC;s nat&shy;u&shy;ral for me to store up knowl&shy;edge si&shy;lent&shy;ly, to learn with&shy;out sa&shy;ti&shy;e&shy;ty, and to teach oth&shy;ers with&shy;out wea&shy;ri&shy;ness.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>7:3</sup>&#8239;My worries are fail&shy;ure to cul&shy;ti&shy;vate vir&shy;tue, fail&shy;ure to ex&shy;plore what I learn, in&shy;a&shy;bil&shy;i&shy;ty to fol&shy;low what is right when I hear it, and in&shy;a&shy;bil&shy;i&shy;ty to change what is not good.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>7:6</sup>&#8239;Set your heart on the Way. Base your&shy;self in vir&shy;tue. Re&shy;ly on be&shy;nev&shy;o&shy;lence. En&shy;joy the arts.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>7:7</sup>&#8239;I have nev&shy;er de&shy;nied in&shy;struc&shy;tion to any&shy;one, e&shy;ven if his own re&shy;sources could on&shy;ly af&shy;ford a bun&shy;dle of dried meat for tu&shy;i&shy;tion.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>7:8</sup>&#8239;I on&shy;ly en&shy;light&shy;en those who are driv&shy;en by ea&shy;ger&shy;ness to learn and who are anx&shy;ious&shy;ly try&shy;ing to ex&shy;plain their i&shy;de&shy;as.  If I lift up one cor&shy;ner and they can&shy;not come back with the oth&shy;er three, I don&#x02BC;t re&shy;peat my&shy;self.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>7:9</sup>&#8239;When Con&shy;fu&shy;cius was eat&shy;ing in the pres&shy;ence of a mourn&shy;er, he nev&shy;er ate his fill.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>7:11</sup>&#8239;Few have the a&shy;bil&shy;i&shy;ty to act when em&shy;ployed and to hide when dis&shy;missed. If I were com&shy;mand&shy;ing the Three Armies, who would I take with me? A man who would wres&shy;tle a ti&shy;ger with bare hands or cross a riv&shy;er on foot, dy&shy;ing with&shy;out re&shy;gret&mdash;I would not take that man.  It must be some&shy;one who approaches a task with ap&shy;pre&shy;hen&shy;sion, likes to make plans, and can ex&shy;e&shy;cute them suc&shy;cess&shy;ful&shy;ly.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>7:12</sup>&#8239;If wealth can be sought de&shy;cent&shy;ly, I will do so, e&shy;ven if I have to have a low&shy;ly job. If it can&shy;not be sought de&shy;cent&shy;ly, I will fol&shy;low what I love.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>7:15</sup>&#8239;Bo Yi and Shu Qi sought be&shy;nev&shy;o&shy;lence and got it. Why should they have com&shy;plaints?
</p>

<p>
    <sup>7:16</sup>&#8239;Coarse rice to eat, wa&shy;ter to drink, and your bent arm for a pil&shy;low&mdash;there is still joy in the midst of these things.  Wealth and hon&shy;or ob&shy;tained by un&shy;right&shy;eous means are like fleet&shy;ing clouds to me.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>7:17</sup>&#8239;Give me a few more years; if I can stud&shy;y un&shy;til fif&shy;ty, I may be free from great mis&shy;takes.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>7:19</sup>&#8239;I&#x02BC;m the kind of man who is so ea&shy;ger for knowl&shy;edge that he for&shy;gets to eat, who is so joy&shy;ful that he for&shy;gets to wor&shy;ry, and who is not a&shy;ware that old age is com&shy;ing.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>7:20</sup>&#8239;I was not born with knowl&shy;edge, but I love an&shy;tiq&shy;ui&shy;ty and ear&shy;nest&shy;ly seek it.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>7:22</sup>&#8239;When walk&shy;ing with any two peo&shy;ple, they must have some&shy;thing to teach me. I se&shy;lect their strengths and fol&shy;low them, their weaknesses and cor&shy;rect my&shy;self.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>7:23</sup>&#8239;Heav&shy;en gave birth to the vir&shy;tue in me. What can an&shy;gry rul&shy;ers do to me?
</p>

<p>
    <sup>7:24</sup>&#8239;My friends, I hide noth&shy;ing from you.  What&shy;ev&shy;er I do, I share with you. That is who I am.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>7:26</sup>&#8239;I can&#x02BC;t hope to meet a sage, but I would be con&shy;tent to meet a su&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;or man.  I can&#x02BC;t hope to meet a tru&shy;ly good man, but I would be con&shy;tent to meet a stead&shy;fast man.  It is hard to be stead&shy;fast when noth&shy;ing pre&shy;tends to be some&shy;thing, emp&shy;ti&shy;ness pre&shy;tends to be full&shy;ness, and pov&shy;er&shy;ty pre&shy;tends to be com&shy;fort.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>7:27</sup>&#8239;Con&shy;fu&shy;cius fished with a line, but didn&#x02BC;t use a net.  He hunt&shy;ed, but didn&#x02BC;t shoot roosting birds.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>7:28</sup>&#8239;There may be those who can act with&shy;out knowl&shy;edge, but I am not one of them.  I hear much, se&shy;lect what is good, and fol&shy;low it.  I see much, and re&shy;mem&shy;ber it.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>7:29</sup>&#8239;To ap&shy;prove of a man&#x02BC;s vis&shy;it doesn&#x02BC;t mean ap&shy;prov&shy;ing of what he does af&shy;ter he leaves. When a man purifies him&shy;self to ap&shy;proach me, I ap&shy;prove of his pu&shy;ri&shy;ty with&shy;out en&shy;dors&shy;ing his past or his fu&shy;ture.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>7:30</sup>&#8239;Is be&shy;nev&shy;o&shy;lence far a&shy;way? As soon as I want be&shy;nev&shy;o&shy;lence, it is at hand.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>7:31</sup>&#8239;I&#x02BC;m for&shy;tu&shy;nate. When I make a mis&shy;take, oth&shy;ers al&shy;ways no&shy;tice it.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>7:34</sup>&#8239;How would I dare claim to be be&shy;nev&shy;o&shy;lent or a sage?  Rath&shy;er, it may be said that I strive for them with&shy;out flag&shy;ging, and teach oth&shy;ers with&shy;out wea&shy;ri&shy;ness.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>7:36</sup>&#8239;Ex&shy;trav&shy;a&shy;gance leads to ar&shy;ro&shy;gance; fru&shy;gal&shy;i&shy;ty leads to stin&shy;gi&shy;ness. It&#x02BC;s bet&shy;ter to be sting&shy;y than ar&shy;ro&shy;gant.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>7:37</sup>&#8239;A su&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;or man is eas&shy;y&shy;go&shy;ing and un&shy;per&shy;turbed. An in&shy;fe&shy;ri&shy;or man is al&shy;ways tense and anx&shy;ious.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>7:38</sup>&#8239;Con&shy;fu&shy;cius was warm yet stern; au&shy;thor&shy;i&shy;ta&shy;tive but not fierce; re&shy;spect&shy;ful yet at ease.
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>8:1</sup>&#8239;Tai Bo can be said to have had the highest vir&shy;tue.  Three times he de&shy;clined his claim to the king&shy;dom.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>8:2</sup>&#8239;Cour&shy;te&shy;sy with&shy;out pro&shy;pri&shy;e&shy;ty is tire&shy;some.  Cau&shy;tion with&shy;out pro&shy;pri&shy;e&shy;ty is ti&shy;mid&shy;i&shy;ty.  Brav&shy;er&shy;y with&shy;out pro&shy;pri&shy;e&shy;ty is cha&shy;os.  Can&shy;dor with&shy;out pro&shy;pri&shy;e&shy;ty is rude&shy;ness.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>8:9</sup>&#8239;The peo&shy;ple can be made to fol&shy;low a path, but they can&#x02BC;t be made to un&shy;der&shy;stand it.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>8:10</sup>&#8239;A man who loves brav&shy;er&shy;y and hates pov&shy;er&shy;ty will pro&shy;ceed to un&shy;ru&shy;ly be&shy;hav&shy;ior.  A man with&shy;out be&shy;nev&shy;o&shy;lence who is de&shy;spised by oth&shy;ers too much will pro&shy;ceed to un&shy;ru&shy;ly be&shy;hav&shy;ior.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>8:11</sup>&#8239;If a man had tal&shy;ents as ad&shy;mi&shy;ra&shy;ble as the Duke of Zhou, but was ar&shy;ro&shy;gant and sting&shy;y, the rest would not be worth no&shy;tic&shy;ing.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>8:13</sup>&#8239;Have sin&shy;cere faith, love learn&shy;ing, and de&shy;fend the good Way un&shy;to death.  Don&#x02BC;t en&shy;ter a state that is in per&shy;il, and don&#x02BC;t stay in one that is in cha&shy;os.  Show your&shy;self when the Way pre&shy;vails in the world, but hide when it does not.  When the Way pre&shy;vails in the state, it is shame&shy;ful to be poor and hum&shy;ble. When the Way does not pre&shy;vail in the state, it is shame&shy;ful to be rich and no&shy;ble.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>8:14</sup>&#8239;Don&#x02BC;t plan the policies of a po&shy;si&shy;tion that you don&#x02BC;t hold.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>8:21</sup>&#8239;I can find no fault in Yu.  His food and drink were fru&shy;gal, yet his of&shy;fer&shy;ings to the spir&shy;its and gods showed ut&shy;ter de&shy;vo&shy;tion.  His clothes were coarse, yet his rit&shy;u&shy;al cap and robes were mag&shy;nif&shy;i&shy;cent.  His dwell&shy;ing was hum&shy;ble, yet he ex&shy;hausted his strength on ir&shy;ri&shy;ga&shy;tion ditches and ca&shy;nals.
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>9:3</sup>&#8239;The rules of rit&shy;u&shy;al pre&shy;scribe a hemp cap.  Now&shy;a&shy;days it is made of silk.  That is more fru&shy;gal.  I fol&shy;low the com&shy;mon prac&shy;tice. The rules of rit&shy;u&shy;al pre&shy;scribe bow&shy;ing be&shy;low the steps. Now&shy;a&shy;days peo&shy;ple bow af&shy;ter as&shy;cend&shy;ing.  That is ar&shy;ro&shy;gant.  Al&shy;though it goes a&shy;gainst the com&shy;mon prac&shy;tice, I bow be&shy;low the steps.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>9:4</sup>&#8239;Con&shy;fu&shy;cius for&shy;bade four things: don&#x02BC;t act on spec&shy;u&shy;la&shy;tion, don&#x02BC;t de&shy;mand cer&shy;tain&shy;ty, don&#x02BC;t be stub&shy;born, and don&#x02BC;t be e&shy;go&shy;tis&shy;ti&shy;cal.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>9:5</sup>&#8239;When Con&shy;fu&shy;cius was in dan&shy;ger in Kuang, he said, <q>Since King Wen died, doesn&#x02BC;t his cul&shy;ture re&shy;side in me? If Heav&shy;en doesn&#x02BC;t want this cul&shy;ture de&shy;stroyed, what can the peo&shy;ple of Kuang do to me?</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>9:6</sup>&#8239;I was poor when I was young, so I learn&shy;ed man&shy;y me&shy;ni&shy;al skills. Must a su&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;or man be skilled in man&shy;y things? No, not man&shy;y.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>9:8</sup>&#8239;Do I have knowl&shy;edge? No, I do not.  A rus&shy;tic asked me a ques&shy;tion and my mind went blank.  I ham&shy;mered at both ends of the ques&shy;tion un&shy;til I got eve&shy;ry&shy;thing out of it.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>9:13</sup>&#8239;Zigong asked, <q>If you had a beau&shy;ti&shy;ful piece of jade here, would you hide it safe&shy;ly in a box or try to get a good price and sell it?</q> Con&shy;fu&shy;cius said, <q>Sell it! All I&#x02BC;m waiting for is the right of&shy;fer.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>9:16</sup>&#8239;I have no dif&shy;fi&shy;cul&shy;ty serv&shy;ing high of&shy;fi&shy;cials when a&shy;broad, serv&shy;ing my el&shy;ders at home, giv&shy;ing my best ef&shy;forts in fu&shy;ner&shy;al ar&shy;range&shy;ments, and avoiding trou&shy;ble from wine.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>9:18</sup>&#8239;I have nev&shy;er seen a man who loves vir&shy;tue as much as he loves beau&shy;ty in wom&shy;en.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>9:19</sup>&#8239;It&#x02BC;s like build&shy;ing a mound: if I stop be&shy;fore the last bas&shy;ket of earth, it re&shy;mains un&shy;fin&shy;ished.  It&#x02BC;s like fill&shy;ing a ditch: al&shy;though I&#x02BC;ve dumped in on&shy;ly a sin&shy;gle bas&shy;ket of earth, if I con&shy;tin&shy;ue then I&#x02BC;m mak&shy;ing prog&shy;ress.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>9:23</sup>&#8239;The young&shy;er gen&shy;er&shy;a&shy;tion should be held in awe.  How do we know that it will not e&shy;qual the pres&shy;ent one?  But if a man reaches for&shy;ty or fif&shy;ty years old with&shy;out dis&shy;tin&shy;guish&shy;ing him&shy;self, he no long&shy;er de&shy;serves awe.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>9:24</sup>&#8239;I can do noth&shy;ing with the man who en&shy;joys po&shy;lite words with&shy;out unfolding their pur&shy;pose, or who a&shy;grees with ex&shy;em&shy;pla&shy;ry words with&shy;out reforming him&shy;self.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>9:25</sup>&#8239;Put loy&shy;al&shy;ty and trust&shy;wor&shy;thi&shy;ness a&shy;bove eve&shy;ry&shy;thing else.  On&shy;ly have friends who are your mor&shy;al e&shy;quals.  When you make a mis&shy;take, don&#x02BC;t be a&shy;fraid to cor&shy;rect it.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>9:30</sup>&#8239;You may be a&shy;ble to stud&shy;y to&shy;geth&shy;er, and yet be un&shy;a&shy;ble to pur&shy;sue the Way to&shy;geth&shy;er.  You may be a&shy;ble to pur&shy;sue the Way to&shy;geth&shy;er, and yet be un&shy;a&shy;ble to take a stand to&shy;geth&shy;er.

<p>
    <sup>10:8</sup>&#8239;E&shy;ven if there was plen&shy;ty of meat, he would not eat more meat than rice.  On&shy;ly with wine did he have no set lim&shy;it, but he nev&shy;er drank to the point of con&shy;fu&shy;sion.

If I had to give up one of these three, I would give up the arms.  If I had to give up one of the remaining two, I would give up the food.

    <sup>12:16</sup>&#8239;The su&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;or man per&shy;fects the good in peo&shy;ple, he does not per&shy;fect the bad.  The in&shy;fe&shy;ri&shy;or man does the op&shy;po&shy;site.
