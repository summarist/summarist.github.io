            </p>
            <p>
                <sup>1:6</sup>&#8239;A young man should re­spect his parents at home, re­spect his elders a­broad, say lit­tle but be trust­wor­thy, love the peo­ple at large but be in­ti­mate with the be­nev­o­lent. If he still has en­er­gy to spare, let him stud­y lit­er­a­ture.

                <sup>1:10</sup>&#8239;Ziqin asked Zigong, “When Con­fu­cius arrives in a coun­try, he al­ways learns a­bout its gov­ern­ment. Does he seek out this in­for­ma­tion or is it giv­en to him?” Zigong replied, “Con­fu­cius obtains it by be­ing cor­dial, up­right, re­spect­ful, fru­gal, and def­er­en­tial. He seeks it dif­fer­ent­ly than oth­er men do.”

            <p>
                <sup>1:14</sup>&#8239;A su­pe­ri­or man seeks nei­ther a full stom­ach nor com­fort­a­ble lodg­ings. He is dil­i­gent in his actions but cau­tious in his speech. He associates with those who know the Way in or­der to be put right. Such a man may be said to love learn­ing.
            </p>
            <p>
                <sup>1:16</sup>&#8239;Donʼt wor­ry that men donʼt rec­og­nize your mer­its; wor­ry that you donʼt rec­og­nize theirs.

                <sup>2:1</sup>&#8239;He who governs by vir­tue is like the North Star: it stays in its place while all the oth­er stars pay hom­age to it.
            </p>
            <p>
                <sup>2:3</sup>&#8239;If you lead the peo­ple with edicts and keep them or­der­ly with punishments, they will e­vade the pun­ish­ment and have no sense of shame. If you lead them with vir­tue and keep them or­der­ly with pro­pri­e­ty, they will have a sense of shame and or­der them­selves.

                <sup>2:6</sup>&#8239;Meng Wubo asked a­bout fil­ial pi­e­ty. Con­fu­cius said, “Give your parents noth­ing to wor­ry a­bout oth­er than ill­ness.”

            <p>
                <sup>2:7</sup>&#8239;Ziyou asked a­bout fil­ial pi­e­ty. Con­fu­cius said, “Now­a­days fil­ial pi­e­ty on­ly means be­ing a­ble to feed your parents. But e­ven dogs and hors­es re­ceive this much care. With­out re­spect, whatʼs the dif­fer­ence?”

            <p>
                <sup>2:8</sup>&#8239;Zixia asked a­bout fil­ial pi­e­ty. Con­fu­cius said, “Itʼs the ex­pres­sion on your face thatʼs dif­fi­cult to man­age. Itʼs not fil­ial pi­e­ty mere­ly for the young to shoul­der the bur­den when there is work to do, and to de­fer to their elders when there is wine and food a­vail­a­ble.”
            </p>
            <p>
                <sup>2:10</sup>&#8239;Look at the means a man employs. Ob­serve his motives. Ex­am­ine what gives him com­fort. How can a man con­ceal his char­ac­ter?

                <sup>2:11</sup>&#8239;If a man learns the new by reviewing the old, he is wor­thy to be a teach­er.

                <sup>2:13</sup>&#8239;A su­pe­ri­or man acts be­fore he speaks, and then speaks ac­cord­ing to his actions.
                <sup>14</sup>&#8239;A su­pe­ri­or man is in­clu­sive and not par­ti­san, while an in­fe­ri­or man is the op­po­site.
            </p>
            <p>
                <sup>2:15</sup>&#8239;Learn­ing with­out think­ing is a waste. Think­ing with­out learn­ing is dan­ger­ous.
            </p>
            <p>
                <sup>2:17</sup>&#8239;Knowl­edge is to know when you know some­thing, and to know when you donʼt.

            <p>
                <sup>2:18</sup>&#8239;Zizhang was stud­y­ing in or­der to get an of­fi­cial po­si­tion. Con­fu­cius said, “If you lis­ten much, put a­side what is doubt­ful, and speak cau­tious­ly a­bout the rest, you will make few mistakes. If you ob­serve much, put a­side what is per­i­lous, and act cau­tious­ly on the rest, you will have few regrets. Few mistakes in speech, few regrets in ac­tion: an of­fi­cial po­si­tion will fol­low.”
            </p>
            <p>
                <sup>2:19</sup>&#8239;If you raise up the straight and place them o­ver the crook­ed, the peo­ple will fol­low you. If you raise up the crook­ed and place them o­ver the straight, the peo­ple will not fol­low you.

            <p>
                <sup>2:20</sup>&#8239;Ji Kangzi asked, “How can I en­cour­age the peo­ple to be re­spect­ful, loy­al, and dil­i­gent?” Con­fu­cius said, “Ap­proach them with dig­ni­ty then they will be re­spect­ful. Be fil­ial and kind then they will be loy­al. Raise up the good and in­struct the in­com­pe­tent then they will be dil­i­gent.”
            </p>
            <p>
                <sup>2:21</sup>&#8239;Some­one asked Con­fu­cius, “Why donʼt you en­gage in gov­ern­ment?” Con­fu­cius said, “The Book of Documents says, ‘Just by be­ing fil­ial and be­ing friend­ly to your brothers you will have an ef­fect on gov­ern­ment.’ Since this is al­so en­gag­ing in gov­ern­ment, why do I need to ‘en­gage in gov­ern­ment’?”
            </p>
            <p>
                <sup>2:22</sup>&#8239;I donʼt know what to do with an un­trust­wor­thy man. How can you pull a wag­on thatʼs mis­sing its yoke pin?
            </p>
            <p>
                <sup>2:24</sup>&#8239;To see what is right and not to do it is a lack of cour­age.

            </p>
            <p>
                <sup>3:4</sup>&#8239;In rit­u­al, pre­fer fru­gal­i­ty to ex­trav­a­gance. In funerals, pre­fer grief to for­mal­i­ty.

                <sup>3:12</sup>&#8239;If I donʼt par­tic­i­pate in a sac­ri­fice, itʼs as if I have not sacrificed at all.
            </p>
            <p>
                <sup>3:15</sup>&#8239;When Con­fu­cius entered the Grand Tem­ple, he asked questions a­bout eve­ry­thing. Some­one remarked, “Who says that Con­fu­cius knows a­bout rit­u­al? When visiting the Grand Tem­ple, he asked questions a­bout eve­ry­thing.” Con­fu­cius, hear­ing this, said, “This is the rit­u­al.”

            <p>
                <sup>3:21</sup>&#8239;Donʼt ex­plain a­way what is al­read­y done. Donʼt ar­gue a­gainst what is al­read­y ac­com­plished. Donʼt as­sign blame for what is al­read­y past.
            </p>
            <p>
                <sup>3:26</sup>&#8239;Hold­ing a high po­si­tion with­out tol­er­ance, per­form­ing rit­u­al with­out rev­er­ence, joining a fu­ner­al with­out grief: how can I look at such things?

                <sup>4:1</sup>&#8239;It is be­nev­o­lence that makes a neigh­bor­hood beau­ti­ful. How can a man be con­sid­ered wise if he chooses not to re­side a­mong be­nev­o­lence?
            </p>
            <p>
                <sup>4:2</sup>&#8239;Those who lack be­nev­o­lence can en­dure nei­ther ad­ver­si­ty nor en­joy­ment for long. The be­nev­o­lent are con­tent with be­nev­o­lence. The wise cul­ti­vate be­nev­o­lence for its ad­van­tage.

            <p>
                <sup>4:4</sup>&#8239;If you set your heart on be­nev­o­lence, you will be free from evil.

            <p>
                <sup>4:5</sup>&#8239;All men de­sire wealth and hon­or, but if they are obtained by not fol­low­ing the Way, they should not be kept. All men hate pov­er­ty and dis­grace, but if they canʼt be avoided by fol­low­ing the Way, they should not be avoided. If a su­pe­ri­or man abandons be­nev­o­lence, how is he wor­thy of that name? A su­pe­ri­or man nev­er leaves be­nev­o­lence e­ven for the space of a sin­gle meal. In moments of haste, he acts ac­cord­ing to it. In times of dif­fi­cul­ty, he acts ac­cord­ing to it.
            </p>
            <p>
                <sup>4:6</sup>&#8239;One who re­al­ly loves be­nev­o­lence puts noth­ing a­bove it. One who re­al­ly hates what is not be­nev­o­lent would not al­low it to ap­proach him. Has any­one de­vot­ed all his strength to be­nev­o­lence for a sin­gle day? I have­nʼt seen any­one who lacked the strength to do so.

                <sup>4:7</sup>&#8239;Peo­ple make errors ac­cord­ing to the type of per­son they are. Ob­serve their errors and you can know their de­gree of be­nev­o­lence.
            </p>
            <p>
                <sup>4:9</sup>&#8239;A gen­tle­man who sets his heart on the Way, but is a­shamed of poor clothes and poor food, is not worth en­gag­ing in dis­cus­sion.
            </p>
            <p>

            <p>
                <sup>4:11</sup>&#8239;A su­pe­ri­or man cherishes vir­tue; an in­fe­ri­or man cherishes land. A su­pe­ri­or man cherishes jus­tice; an in­fe­ri­or man cherishes fa­vors.

                <sup>15:10</sup>&#8239;In what­ev­er coun­try youʼre liv­ing, serve its most vir­tu­ous officers, and be­friend its most be­nev­o­lent gentelmen. This is how to prac­tice be­nev­o­lence.
            </p>
            <p>
                <sup>15:12</sup>&#8239;If a man does­nʼt con­cern him­self with whatʼs far a­way, he will have sorrows near at hand.
            </p>
            <p>
                <sup>15:15</sup>&#8239;If you de­mand much from your­self and lit­tle from others, you will keep re­sent­ment at a dis­tance.
            </p>
            <p>
                <sup>15:18</sup>&#8239;A su­pe­ri­or man takes what is right as his ba­sis. He practices it with pro­pri­e­ty, demonstrates it with mod­es­ty, and completes it with good faith.
            </p>
            <p>
                <sup>15:20</sup>&#8239;A su­pe­ri­or man hates the thought of leav­ing the world with­out mak­ing a name for him­self.
                <sup>21</sup>&#8239;A su­pe­ri­or man makes demands on him­self; an in­fe­ri­or man makes demands on others.
                <sup>22</sup>&#8239;A su­pe­ri­or man is con­fi­dent with­out be­ing con­ten­tious; gathers with others but does­nʼt form cliques.
                <sup>23</sup>&#8239;A su­pe­ri­or man does­nʼt pro­mote a man be­cause of his words, and does­nʼt re­ject the words be­cause of the man.
            </p>
            <p>
                <sup>15:27</sup>&#8239;Clev­er words dis­rupt vir­tue. Im­pa­tience in small matters disrupts great plans.
            </p>
            <p>
                <sup>15:28</sup>&#8239; When eve­ry­one loves a man, you must in­ves­ti­gate. When eve­ry­one hates a man, you must in­ves­ti­gate.
            </p>
            <p>
                <sup>15:30</sup>&#8239;To have a fault and not cor­rect it is a fault in­deed.
            </p>
            <p>
                <sup>15:31</sup>&#8239;I once spent a whole day with­out eat­ing and a whole night with­out sleep­ing in or­der to think. I got noth­ing out of it. It would have been bet­ter to stud­y.
            </p>
            <p>
                <sup>15:32</sup>&#8239;A su­pe­ri­or man makes his plans a­round the Way, not a­round food. A su­pe­ri­or man worries a­bout the Way, not a­bout pov­er­ty.
            </p>
            <p>
                <sup>15:36</sup>&#8239;In the pur­suit of be­nev­o­lence, donʼt yield e­ven to your teach­er.
            </p>
            <p>
                <sup>15:37</sup>&#8239;A su­pe­ri­or man is prin­ci­pled, but not rig­id.
            </p>
            <p>
                <sup>15:38</sup>&#8239;In serv­ing your rul­er, de­vo­tion to du­ty co­mes be­fore any thought of com­pen­sa­tion.
                <sup>39</sup>&#8239;In teach­ing, there is no such thing as so­cial class.
            </p>
            <p>
                <sup>15:40</sup>&#8239;Those who fol­low a dif­fer­ent Way canʼt make plans to­geth­er.
            </p>
            <p>
                <sup>15:41</sup>&#8239;In expressing your­self, get the point a­cross then stop.
