            <p>
                <sup>5:1</sup>&#8239;Mo­ses summoned all Israel and said to them, Hear the statutes and ordinances that I speak to­day. Learn them and ob­serve them care­ful­ly.
                <sup>2</sup>&#8239;GOD made a cov­e­nant with us.
                <sup>3</sup>&#8239;GOD did not make this cov­e­nant with our fathers.
                <sup>4</sup>&#8239;GOD spoke with you on the moun­tain, say­ing,
            </p>
            <p>
                <sup>5:6</sup>&#8239;I am GOD, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slav­er­y.
                <sup>7</sup>&#8239;Donʼt have oth­er gods be­fore me.
                <sup>8</sup>&#8239;Donʼt make an i­dol for your­self in the form of any­thing in the heavens or on the earth or in the waters.
                <sup>9</sup>&#8239;Donʼt wor­ship them or serve them, for I am a jeal­ous god, visiting the in­iq­ui­ty of the fathers on the chil­dren to the third and fourth gen­er­a­tion,
                <sup>10</sup>&#8239;but show­ing love to thousands who love me and keep my commandments.
            </p>
            <p>
                <sup>5:11</sup>&#8239;Donʼt mis­use the name of GOD.
            </p>
            <p>
                <sup>5:12</sup>&#8239;Ob­serve the sabbath day by keep­ing it ho­ly.
                <sup>13</sup>&#8239;La­bor six days and do all your work,
                <sup>14</sup>&#8239;but the sev­enth day is a sabbath to GOD. On it you shall not do any work: nei­ther you, your chil­dren, your serv­ant, your live­stock, nor any for­eign­er liv­ing a­mong you, that they may rest as you do.
                <sup>15</sup>&#8239;Re­mem­ber that you were slaves in Egypt, and that GOD brought you out. There­fore, GOD commanded you to keep the sabbath day.
            </p>
            <p>
                <sup>5:16</sup>&#8239;Hon­or your parents so that you may live long and that it may go well with you in the land that GOD is giv­ing you.
            </p>
            <p>
                <sup>5:17</sup>&#8239;Donʼt mur­der.

                <sup>19</sup>&#8239;Donʼt steal.
                <sup>20</sup>&#8239;Donʼt give false tes­ti­mo­ny a­gainst your neigh­bor.
                <sup>21</sup>&#8239;Donʼt cov­et your neighborʼs wife, house, field, servants, live­stock, or any­thing that belongs to your neigh­bor.
            </p>
            <p>
                <sup>5:32</sup>&#8239;Be care­ful to do as GOD has commanded you. Donʼt turn a­side to the right or to the left.
                <sup>33</sup>&#8239;Walk on the path which GOD has commanded you, that you may live, pros­per, and pro­long your days in the land that you will pos­sess.

                <sup>6</sup>&#8239;These words that I com­mand you to­day shall be on your heart.
            </p>
            <p>
                <sup>6:10</sup>&#8239;When GOD brings you in­to the land that he swore to your fathers Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob that he would give you — a land with large and splen­did cit­ies,
                <sup>11</sup>&#8239;hous­es filled with eve­ry good thing, cisterns, vineyards, and ol­ive trees — when you eat and are sat­is­fied,
                <sup>12</sup>&#8239;then be care­ful not to for­get GOD.
            </p>

            </p>
            <p>
                <sup>6:20</sup>&#8239;When your son asks you, “What is the mean­ing of the testimonies, the statutes, and the rules that GOD has commanded you?”
                <sup>21</sup>&#8239;tell him, “We were slaves to Pharaoh in Egypt, but GOD brought us out of Egypt.
                <sup>23</sup>&#8239;He brought us out from there in or­der to give us the land that he swore to our fathers.
                <sup>24</sup>&#8239;So GOD commanded us to ob­serve all these statutes and to fear GOD for our good and our sur­viv­al.”

            <p>
                <sup>7:1</sup>&#8239;When GOD brings you in­to the land, and clears a­way man­y nations be­fore you,
                <sup>3</sup>&#8239;donʼt in­ter­mar­ry with them.
                <sup>4</sup>&#8239;They will turn your chil­dren a­way from me, to wor­ship oth­er gods.
            </p>
            <p>
                <sup>7:7</sup>&#8239;GOD did­nʼt choose you be­cause you were more nu­mer­ous than oth­er peo­ple,
                <sup>8</sup>&#8239;but be­cause GOD loves you and is keep­ing the oath that he swore to your fathers.
            </p>
            <p>
                <sup>7:12</sup>&#8239;If you lis­ten to and care­ful­ly keep these ordinances, GOD will keep the cov­e­nant of love with you that he swore to your fathers.
                <sup>13</sup>&#8239;He will love you, bless you, and mul­ti­ply you. He will bless the fruit of your womb, the crops of your land, and the in­crease of your herd.
            </p>
            <p>
                <sup>7:17</sup>&#8239;If you say in your heart, “These nations are greater than I. How can I dis­pos­sess them?”
                <sup>18</sup>&#8239;Donʼt be a­fraid of them. Re­mem­ber what GOD did to Pharaoh and to all Egypt.
                <sup>21</sup>&#8239;Donʼt dread them, for GOD is a­mong you, a great and awe­some god.
                <sup>22</sup>&#8239;GOD will clear a­way these nations be­fore you lit­tle by lit­tle. You will not e­lim­i­nate them all at once, lest the wild animals be­come too nu­mer­ous for you.
                <sup>25</sup>&#8239;Burn the carved images of their gods. Donʼt cov­et the sil­ver or gold that is on them, nor take it for your­self, lest you be en­snared by it.
                <sup>26</sup>&#8239;Donʼt bring an a­bom­i­na­tion in­to your house, lest you be set a­part for de­struc­tion. In­stead, utterly de­test it and ab­hor it.

            <p>
                <sup>8:2</sup>&#8239;Re­mem­ber how GOD led you these for­ty years in the wil­der­ness, to hum­ble you, and to test what was in your heart, wheth­er you would keep his commandments.
                <sup>3</sup>&#8239;He humbled you, let you go hun­gry, then fed you with man­na, which nei­ther you nor your fathers had known, to teach you that man does not live by bread a­lone, but by eve­ry word that co­mes from the mouth of GOD.
                <sup>5</sup>&#8239;Know in your heart that GOD disciplines you just as a man disciplines his son.
                <sup>6</sup>&#8239;There­fore keep the commandments of GOD by walk­ing in his ways and by fearing him.
                <sup>10</sup>&#8239;When youʼve eat­en and are sat­is­fied, then bless GOD for the good land he has giv­en you.
            </p>
            <p>
                <sup>8:11</sup>&#8239;Be care­ful not to for­get GOD, by fail­ing to keep his commandments, his ordinances, and his statutes.
                <sup>12</sup>&#8239;Oth­er­wise, once youʼve eat­en and are sat­is­fied, and have built good hous­es to live in,
                <sup>13</sup>&#8239;and when your herds mul­ti­ply, and your sil­ver and gold mul­ti­ply, and eve­ry­thing you have multiplies,
                <sup>14</sup>&#8239;then your heart will be­come proud, and you will for­get GOD,
                <sup>17</sup>&#8239;and you may say in your heart, “My pow­er and the strength of my hand has made me this wealth.”
                <sup>18</sup>&#8239;But re­mem­ber that GOD gives you pow­er to make wealth in or­der to con­firm his cov­e­nant.
                <sup>19</sup>&#8239;If you for­get GOD, fol­low oth­er gods, serve them, and wor­ship them, I tes­ti­fy a­gainst you to­day that you will sure­ly per­ish.

            <p>
                <sup>9:4</sup>&#8239;Once GOD has driv­en the peo­ple out be­fore you, donʼt say in your heart, “GOD brought me in to pos­sess this land be­cause of my right­eous­ness.” In­stead, GOD drives them out be­cause of their wick­ed­ness.
                <sup>6</sup>&#8239;Un­der­stand that GOD is­nʼt giv­ing you this good land be­cause of your right­eous­ness, for you are a stub­born peo­ple.
                <sup>7</sup>&#8239;Donʼt for­get how you pro­voked GOD in the wil­der­ness. From the day you de­part­ed Egypt un­til you ar­rived in this place, you have been re­bel­lious a­gainst GOD.

                <sup>18</sup>&#8239;He executes jus­tice for orphans and widows, and loves the for­eign­er by giv­ing him food and cloth­ing.
                <sup>19</sup>&#8239;There­fore, love the for­eign­er, for you were foreigners in Egypt.

                <sup>4</sup>&#8239;what he did to the ar­my of Egypt; how he made the wa­ter of the Red sea en­gulf them as they pur­sued you;
                <sup>5</sup>&#8239;and what he did to you in the wil­der­ness, un­til you reached this place;
                <sup>7</sup>&#8239;but your eyes have seen eve­ry great work GOD has done.
            </p>
            <p>
                <sup>11:16</sup>&#8239;Be care­ful not to be en­ticed to turn a­side and serve oth­er gods and wor­ship them.
                <sup>18</sup>&#8239;There­fore im­print my words on your heart and on your soul, bind them as a sign on your hand, and wear them on your foreheads.
                <sup>19</sup>&#8239;Teach them to your chil­dren, speak of them when you sit in your house, when you walk a­long the road, when you lie down, and when you get up.
                <sup>20</sup>&#8239;Write them on the doorposts of your house and on your gates,
                <sup>21</sup>&#8239;that your days, and the days of your chil­dren, may be mul­ti­plied as long as the heavens are a­bove the earth.

                <sup>12:4</sup>&#8239;Donʼt wor­ship GOD in the same way as the nations you dis­pos­sess.
                <sup>5</sup>&#8239;In­stead, seek the place where GOD chooses to es­tab­lish his name. Go there
                <sup>6</sup>&#8239;and bring your burnt offerings, your sacrifices, your tithes, your contributions, your vow offerings, your free­will offerings, and the firstborn of your live­stock.
                <sup>7</sup>&#8239;There, in the pres­ence of GOD, you and your families will eat and re­joice in eve­ry­thing you un­der­take, be­cause GOD has bless­ed you.
            </p>
            <p>
