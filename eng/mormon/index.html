            <p>
                <sup>1:1</sup>&#8239;I, Jo­seph Smith, write this his­to­ry to put all inquirers af­ter truth in pos­ses­sion of the facts.
            </p>
            <p>
                <sup>1:5</sup>&#8239;There was in the place where I lived an un­u­su­al ex­cite­ment on the sub­ject of re­li­gion.
                <sup>6</sup>&#8239;The cler­gy pro­mot­ed this scene of re­li­gious feel­ing in or­der to have eve­ry­bod­y con­vert­ed, let them join what sect they pleased. Yet when the converts be­gan to file off, some to one par­ty and some to an­oth­er, it was seen that the seemingly good feelings of both the priests and the converts were more pre­tend­ed than re­al, lost in a strife of words: priest contending a­gainst priest, and con­vert a­gainst con­vert.
            </p>
            <p>
                <sup>1:7</sup>&#8239;I was at this time four­teen years old.
                <sup>8</sup>&#8239;My mind was called up to se­ri­ous re­flec­tion and great un­eas­i­ness. My feelings were deep and of­ten poign­ant, but still I kept my­self a­loof from all the parties, though I attended their meetings as of­ten as oc­ca­sion would per­mit. So great were the con­fu­sion and strife a­mong the dif­fer­ent denominations, that it was im­pos­si­ble for a per­son as young as I was to come to any cer­tain con­clu­sion who was right and who was wrong.
            </p>
            <p>
                <sup>1:10</sup>&#8239;In the midst of this war of words and tu­mult of opinions, I of­ten said to my­self, “What is to be done? If any of these parties is right, which is it, and how will I know it?”
            </p>
            <p>
                <sup>1:11</sup>&#8239;One day I was read­ing James 1:5, which reads, “If any of you lacks wis­dom, let him ask God, who gives gen­er­ous­ly to all with­out re­proach, and it will be giv­en to him.”
                <sup>12</sup>&#8239;This pas­sage entered with great force in­to eve­ry feel­ing of my heart. I reflected on it a­gain and a­gain, know­ing that if any per­son needed wis­dom from God, I did; for the dif­fer­ent sects un­der­stood the same passages of scrip­ture so dif­fer­ent­ly as to de­stroy all con­fi­dence in set­tling the ques­tion by an ap­peal to the Bible.
            </p>
            <p>
                <sup>1:13</sup>&#8239;At length I came to the de­ter­mi­na­tion to “ask God.”
                <sup>14</sup>&#8239;So, in ac­cord­ance with my de­ter­mi­na­tion, I re­tired to the woods to make the at­tempt. It was the first time in my life that I had made the at­tempt to pray vo­cal­ly.
            </p>
            <p>
                <sup>1:15</sup>&#8239;Hav­ing looked a­round me, and find­ing my­self a­lone, I kneeled down and be­gan to of­fer up the desires of my heart to God. I had scarce­ly done so when
                <sup>16</sup>&#8239;I saw a pil­lar of light o­ver my head.
                <sup>17</sup>&#8239;When the light rested up­on me, I saw two personages. One of them said to me, “Jo­seph, this is my be­lov­ed son. Hear him.”
            </p>
            <p>
                <sup>1:18</sup>&#8239;I asked the personages which of all the sects was right, and which I should join.
                <sup>19</sup>&#8239;I was answered that I must join none of them.
            </p>
            
            <div class="scene"></div>
            
            <p>
                <sup>1:21</sup>&#8239;A few days af­ter I had this vi­sion, I was with one of the preachers who was ver­y ac­tive in the re­li­gious ex­cite­ment. I gave him an ac­count of the vi­sion which I had had. He treated my com­mu­ni­ca­tion with con­tempt, say­ing that there were no such things as visions or revelations in these days.
            </p>
            <p>
                <sup>1:22</sup>&#8239;I soon found that my sto­ry had ex­cit­ed a great deal of prej­u­dice a­gainst me a­mong the professors of re­li­gion. They ex­cit­ed the pub­lic mind a­gainst me and cre­at­ed a bit­ter per­se­cu­tion. This was com­mon a­mong all the sects,
                <sup>23</sup>&#8239;and it of­ten caused me great sor­row.
            </p>
            <p>
                <sup>1:24</sup>&#8239;How­ev­er, it was nev­er­the­less a fact that I had seen a vi­sion, and all the per­se­cu­tion un­der heav­en could not make it oth­er­wise.
                <sup>25</sup>&#8239;I said in my heart, “Why per­se­cute me for tell­ing the truth? For I have seen a vi­sion. I know it, and I know that God knows it, and I can not de­ny it.”
            </p>
            
            <div class="scene"></div>
            
            <p>
                <sup>1:27</sup>&#8239;I con­tin­ued to pur­sue my com­mon vocations in life, all the time be­ing
                <sup>28</sup>&#8239;per­se­cut­ed by those who ought to have been my friends and to have treated me kind­ly. If they sup­posed me to be de­lud­ed, they ought to have endeavored to re­claim me in a prop­er and af­fec­tion­ate man­ner. I was left to mingling with all kinds of so­ci­e­ty, and fre­quent­ly fell in­to man­y fool­ish errors. In mak­ing this con­fes­sion, no one need sup­pose me guilt­y of any great sins, but I was guilt­y of lev­i­ty and some­times as­so­ci­at­ed with jo­vi­al com­pa­ny.
            </p>
            <p>
                <sup>1:29</sup>&#8239;In con­se­quence of these things, I of­ten felt condemned for my weaknesses and imperfections. One eve­ning, I be­took my­self to pray­er and sup­pli­ca­tion to God for for­give­ness of my sins and follies.
                <sup>30</sup>&#8239;While I was call­ing up­on God, I discovered a light appearing in my room, and im­me­di­ate­ly a per­son­age appeared.
            </p>
            <p>
                <sup>1:33</sup>&#8239;He called me by name, said that he was a mes­sen­ger from God, and that his name was Moroni.
                <sup>34</sup>&#8239;He said that there was a book, writ­ten up­on gold plates, giv­ing an ac­count of the form­er inhabitants of this con­ti­nent.
                <sup>42</sup>&#8239;The vi­sion was opened to my mind so that I could see the place where the plates were deposited.
                <sup>46</sup>&#8239;He added a cau­tion, tell­ing me that Satan would try to tempt me to get the plates for the purposes of get­ting rich. This he for­bade me, say­ing that I must on­ly get the plates to glo­ri­fy God.
                <sup>53</sup>&#8239;The mes­sen­ger in­formed me that the time for bring­ing forth the plates would ar­rive in four years.
            </p>
            
            <div class="scene"></div>
            
            <p>
                <sup>1:54</sup>&#8239;I went at the end of each year to the place where the plates were deposited. Each time I found the same mes­sen­ger there, and re­ceived in­struc­tion from him.
            </p>
            <p>
                <sup>1:59</sup>&#8239;At length, the time ar­rived for obtaining the plates. Hav­ing gone as u­su­al at the end of an­oth­er year to the place where they were deposited, the same mes­sen­ger delivered them to me.
                <sup>67</sup>&#8239;I com­menced to trans­late the Book of Mormon.

            <p>
                <sup>1:1</sup>&#8239;I, Nephi, am mak­ing a rec­ord of my proceedings dur­ing my life­time.
            </p>
            <p>
                <sup>1:4</sup>&#8239;In the first year of the reign of Zed­e­ki­ah, king of Judah,
                <sup>18</sup>&#8239;God showed my fa­ther, Lehi, man­y things a­bout the de­struc­tion of Je­ru­sa­lem. He went a­mong the peo­ple, and de­clared to them what he had seen.
                <sup>20</sup>&#8239;When the peo­ple heard these things, they were an­gry with him, and sought his life.
            </p>
            <p>
                <sup>2:2</sup>&#8239;God commanded my fa­ther in a dream to take his fam­i­ly, and de­part in­to the wil­der­ness.
                <sup>4</sup>&#8239;He left his house, land, gold, sil­ver, and pre­cious things, and took noth­ing with him, ex­cept his fam­i­ly, provisions, and tents, and de­part­ed in­to the wil­der­ness.
            </p>
            <p>
                <sup>2:11</sup>&#8239;La­man and Lem­uel, my old­er brothers, grumbled a­gainst their fa­ther be­cause he had led them out of Je­ru­sa­lem, leav­ing their land, gold, sil­ver, and pre­cious things. They said he had done this be­cause of the fool­ish imaginations of his heart.
                <sup>13</sup>&#8239;They al­so did not be­lieve that Je­ru­sa­lem could be destroyed.
            </p>
            <p>
                <sup>2:16</sup>&#8239;I be­lieved all that my fa­ther had spo­ken. There­fore, I did not reb­el a­gainst him like my brothers.
            </p>
            
            <div class="scene"></div>
            
            <p>
                <sup>3:2</sup>&#8239;My fa­ther said to me,
                <sup>3</sup>&#8239;“Laban has the rec­ord of the Jews, and itʼs en­graved on brass plates.
                <sup>4</sup>&#8239;There­fore, God has commanded me that you and your brothers should re­turn to Je­ru­sa­lem, go to Labanʼs house, seek the records, and bring them here in­to the wil­der­ness.”
            </p>
            <p>
                <sup>3:7</sup>&#8239;I said to my fa­ther, “Iʼll go and do what God has commanded, for I know that God gives no commandments un­less he prepares a way to ac­com­plish them.”
            </p>
            <p>
                <sup>3:19</sup>&#8239;I said to my brothers, “Itʼs wis­dom in God that we should ob­tain these records, that we may pre­serve for our chil­dren
                <sup>20</sup>&#8239;the words spo­ken by all the ho­ly prophets.”

            <p>
                <sup>5:1</sup>&#8239;Af­ter we returned to our fa­ther, he was filled with joy, and al­so my moth­er was ver­y glad.
                <sup>21</sup>&#8239;We had obtained the records which God had commanded us, and found that they had great val­ue to us, be­cause we could pre­serve the commandments of God for our chil­dren.

                <sup>16</sup>&#8239;He selected a wise man, and
                <sup>18</sup>&#8239;delivered the judg­ment seat to him.
