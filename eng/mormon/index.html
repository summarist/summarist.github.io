<p>
    <sup>1:1</sup>&#8239;I, Jo&shy;seph Smith, write this his&shy;to&shy;ry to put all in&shy;quir&shy;ers af&shy;ter truth in pos&shy;ses&shy;sion of the facts.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>1:5</sup>&#8239;There was in the place where I lived an un&shy;u&shy;su&shy;al ex&shy;cite&shy;ment on the sub&shy;ject of re&shy;li&shy;gion.
    <sup>6</sup>&#8239;The cler&shy;gy pro&shy;mot&shy;ed this scene of re&shy;li&shy;gious feel&shy;ing in or&shy;der to have eve&shy;ry&shy;bod&shy;y con&shy;vert&shy;ed, let them join what sect they pleased. Yet when the con&shy;verts be&shy;gan to file off, some to one par&shy;ty and some to an&shy;oth&shy;er, it was seen that the seemingly good feel&shy;ings of both the priests and the con&shy;verts were more pre&shy;tend&shy;ed than re&shy;al, lost in a strife of words: priest contending a&shy;gainst priest, and con&shy;vert a&shy;gainst con&shy;vert.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>1:7</sup>&#8239;I was at this time four&shy;teen years old.
    <sup>8</sup>&#8239;My mind was called up to se&shy;ri&shy;ous re&shy;flec&shy;tion and great un&shy;eas&shy;i&shy;ness. My feel&shy;ings were deep and of&shy;ten poign&shy;ant, but still I kept my&shy;self a&shy;loof from all the parties, though I at&shy;tended their meet&shy;ings as of&shy;ten as oc&shy;ca&shy;sion would per&shy;mit.  So great were the con&shy;fu&shy;sion and strife a&shy;mong the dif&shy;fer&shy;ent de&shy;nom&shy;i&shy;na&shy;tions, that it was im&shy;pos&shy;si&shy;ble for a per&shy;son as young as I was to come to any cer&shy;tain con&shy;clu&shy;sion who was right and who was wrong.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>1:10</sup>&#8239;In the midst of this war of words and tu&shy;mult of o&shy;pin&shy;ions, I of&shy;ten said to my&shy;self, <q>What is to be done?  If any of these parties is right, which is it, and how will I know it?</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>1:11</sup>&#8239;One day I was read&shy;ing James 1:5, which reads, <q>If any of you lacks wis&shy;dom, let him ask God, who gives gen&shy;er&shy;ous&shy;ly to all with&shy;out re&shy;proach, and it will be giv&shy;en to him.</q>
    <sup>12</sup>&#8239;This pas&shy;sage en&shy;tered with great force in&shy;to eve&shy;ry feel&shy;ing of my heart. I re&shy;flected on it a&shy;gain and a&shy;gain, know&shy;ing that if any per&shy;son needed wis&shy;dom from God, I did; for the dif&shy;fer&shy;ent sects un&shy;der&shy;stood the same pas&shy;sages of scrip&shy;ture so dif&shy;fer&shy;ent&shy;ly as to de&shy;stroy all con&shy;fi&shy;dence in set&shy;tling the ques&shy;tion by an ap&shy;peal to the Bible.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>1:13</sup>&#8239;At length I came to the de&shy;ter&shy;mi&shy;na&shy;tion to <q>ask God.</q>
    <sup>14</sup>&#8239;So, in ac&shy;cord&shy;ance with my de&shy;ter&shy;mi&shy;na&shy;tion, I re&shy;tired to the woods to make the at&shy;tempt.  It was the first time in my life that I had made the at&shy;tempt to pray vo&shy;cal&shy;ly.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>1:15</sup>&#8239;Hav&shy;ing looked a&shy;round me, and find&shy;ing my&shy;self a&shy;lone, I kneeled down and be&shy;gan to of&shy;fer up the de&shy;sires of my heart to God. I had scarce&shy;ly done so when
    <sup>16</sup>&#8239;I saw a pil&shy;lar of light o&shy;ver my head.
    <sup>17</sup>&#8239;When the light rested up&shy;on me, I saw two per&shy;son&shy;ages. One of them said to me, <q>Jo&shy;seph, this is my be&shy;lov&shy;ed son. Hear him.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>1:18</sup>&#8239;I asked the per&shy;son&shy;ages which of all the sects was right, and which I should join.
    <sup>19</sup>&#8239;I was an&shy;swered that I must join none of them.
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>1:21</sup>&#8239;A few days af&shy;ter I had this vi&shy;sion, I was with one of the preach&shy;ers who was ver&shy;y ac&shy;tive in the re&shy;li&shy;gious ex&shy;cite&shy;ment.  I gave him an ac&shy;count of the vi&shy;sion which I had had.  He treated my com&shy;mu&shy;ni&shy;ca&shy;tion with con&shy;tempt, say&shy;ing that there were no such things as vi&shy;sions or rev&shy;e&shy;la&shy;tions in these days.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>1:22</sup>&#8239;I soon found that my sto&shy;ry had ex&shy;cit&shy;ed a great deal of prej&shy;u&shy;dice a&shy;gainst me a&shy;mong the pro&shy;fes&shy;sors of re&shy;li&shy;gion. They ex&shy;cit&shy;ed the pub&shy;lic mind a&shy;gainst me and cre&shy;at&shy;ed a bit&shy;ter per&shy;se&shy;cu&shy;tion.  This was com&shy;mon a&shy;mong all the sects,
    <sup>23</sup>&#8239;and it of&shy;ten caused me great sor&shy;row.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>1:24</sup>&#8239;How&shy;ev&shy;er, it was nev&shy;er&shy;the&shy;less a fact that I had seen a vi&shy;sion, and all the per&shy;se&shy;cu&shy;tion un&shy;der heav&shy;en could not make it oth&shy;er&shy;wise.
    <sup>25</sup>&#8239;I said in my heart, <q>Why per&shy;se&shy;cute me for tell&shy;ing the truth? For I have seen a vi&shy;sion. I know it, and I know that God knows it, and I can not de&shy;ny it.</q>
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>1:27</sup>&#8239;I con&shy;tin&shy;ued to pur&shy;sue my com&shy;mon vo&shy;ca&shy;tions in life, all the time be&shy;ing
    <sup>28</sup>&#8239;per&shy;se&shy;cut&shy;ed by those who ought to have been my friends and to have treated me kind&shy;ly.  If they sup&shy;posed me to be de&shy;lud&shy;ed, they ought to have en&shy;deav&shy;ored to re&shy;claim me in a prop&shy;er and af&shy;fec&shy;tion&shy;ate man&shy;ner.  I was left to mingling with all kinds of so&shy;ci&shy;e&shy;ty, and fre&shy;quent&shy;ly fell in&shy;to man&shy;y fool&shy;ish er&shy;rors.  In mak&shy;ing this con&shy;fes&shy;sion, no one need sup&shy;pose me guilt&shy;y of any great sins, but I was guilt&shy;y of lev&shy;i&shy;ty and some&shy;times as&shy;so&shy;ci&shy;at&shy;ed with jo&shy;vi&shy;al com&shy;pa&shy;ny.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>1:29</sup>&#8239;In con&shy;se&shy;quence of these things, I of&shy;ten felt con&shy;demned for my weaknesses and im&shy;per&shy;fec&shy;tions.  One eve&shy;ning, I be&shy;took my&shy;self to pray&shy;er and sup&shy;pli&shy;ca&shy;tion to God for for&shy;give&shy;ness of my sins and follies.
    <sup>30</sup>&#8239;While I was call&shy;ing up&shy;on God, I dis&shy;cov&shy;ered a light appearing in my room, and im&shy;me&shy;di&shy;ate&shy;ly a per&shy;son&shy;age ap&shy;peared.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>1:33</sup>&#8239;He called me by name, said that he was a mes&shy;sen&shy;ger from God, and that his name was Moroni.
    <sup>34</sup>&#8239;He said that there was a book, writ&shy;ten up&shy;on gold plates, giv&shy;ing an ac&shy;count of the form&shy;er in&shy;hab&shy;it&shy;ants of this con&shy;ti&shy;nent.
    <sup>42</sup>&#8239;The vi&shy;sion was o&shy;pened to my mind so that I could see the place where the plates were de&shy;pos&shy;ited.
    <sup>46</sup>&#8239;He added a cau&shy;tion, tell&shy;ing me that Satan would try to tempt me to get the plates for the pur&shy;poses of get&shy;ting rich.  This he for&shy;bade me, say&shy;ing that I must on&shy;ly get the plates to glo&shy;ri&shy;fy God.
    <sup>53</sup>&#8239;The mes&shy;sen&shy;ger in&shy;formed me that the time for bring&shy;ing forth the plates would ar&shy;rive in four years.
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>1:54</sup>&#8239;I went at the end of each year to the place where the plates were de&shy;pos&shy;ited.  Each time I found the same mes&shy;sen&shy;ger there, and re&shy;ceived in&shy;struc&shy;tion from him.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>1:59</sup>&#8239;At length, the time ar&shy;rived for obtaining the plates.  Hav&shy;ing gone as u&shy;su&shy;al at the end of an&shy;oth&shy;er year to the place where they were de&shy;pos&shy;ited, the same mes&shy;sen&shy;ger de&shy;liv&shy;ered them to me.
    <sup>67</sup>&#8239;I com&shy;menced to trans&shy;late the Book of Mormon.
</p>


<h2 id="1-nephi">1 Nephi</h2>
<p>
    <sup>1:1</sup>&#8239;I, Nephi, am mak&shy;ing a rec&shy;ord of my pro&shy;ceed&shy;ings dur&shy;ing my life&shy;time.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>1:4</sup>&#8239;In the first year of the reign of Zed&shy;e&shy;ki&shy;ah, king of Judah,
    <sup>18</sup>&#8239;God showed my fa&shy;ther, Lehi, man&shy;y things a&shy;bout the de&shy;struc&shy;tion of Je&shy;ru&shy;sa&shy;lem. He went a&shy;mong the peo&shy;ple, and de&shy;clared to them what he had seen.
    <sup>20</sup>&#8239;When the peo&shy;ple heard these things, they were an&shy;gry with him, and sought his life.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:2</sup>&#8239;God com&shy;manded my fa&shy;ther in a dream to take his fam&shy;i&shy;ly, and de&shy;part in&shy;to the wil&shy;der&shy;ness.
    <sup>4</sup>&#8239;He left his house, land, gold, sil&shy;ver, and pre&shy;cious things, and took noth&shy;ing with him, ex&shy;cept his fam&shy;i&shy;ly, pro&shy;vi&shy;sions, and tents, and de&shy;part&shy;ed in&shy;to the wil&shy;der&shy;ness.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:11</sup>&#8239;La&shy;man and Lem&shy;uel, my old&shy;er broth&shy;ers, grumbled a&shy;gainst their fa&shy;ther be&shy;cause he had led them out of Je&shy;ru&shy;sa&shy;lem, leav&shy;ing their land, gold, sil&shy;ver, and pre&shy;cious things. They said he had done this be&shy;cause of the fool&shy;ish im&shy;ag&shy;i&shy;na&shy;tions of his heart.
    <sup>13</sup>&#8239;They al&shy;so did not be&shy;lieve that Je&shy;ru&shy;sa&shy;lem could be de&shy;stroyed.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:16</sup>&#8239;I be&shy;lieved all that my fa&shy;ther had spo&shy;ken. There&shy;fore, I did not reb&shy;el a&shy;gainst him like my broth&shy;ers.
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>3:2</sup>&#8239;My fa&shy;ther said to me,
    <sup>3</sup>&#8239;<q>Laban has the rec&shy;ord of the Jews, and it&#x02BC;s en&shy;graved on brass plates.
    <sup>4</sup>&#8239;There&shy;fore, God has com&shy;manded me that you and your broth&shy;ers should re&shy;turn to Je&shy;ru&shy;sa&shy;lem, go to Laban&#x02BC;s house, seek the re&shy;cords, and bring them here in&shy;to the wil&shy;der&shy;ness.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>3:7</sup>&#8239;I said to my fa&shy;ther, <q>I&#x02BC;ll go and do what God has com&shy;manded, for I know that God gives no com&shy;mand&shy;ments un&shy;less he pre&shy;pares a way to ac&shy;com&shy;plish them.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>3:19</sup>&#8239;I said to my broth&shy;ers, <q>It&#x02BC;s wis&shy;dom in God that we should ob&shy;tain these re&shy;cords, that we may pre&shy;serve for our chil&shy;dren
    <sup>20</sup>&#8239;the words spo&shy;ken by all the ho&shy;ly proph&shy;ets.</q>
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>3:23</sup>&#8239;We went up to the house of Laban.
    <sup>4:38</sup>&#8239;My broth&shy;ers and I took the brass plates, de&shy;part&shy;ed in&shy;to the wil&shy;der&shy;ness, and jour&shy;neyed to our fa&shy;ther&#x02BC;s tent.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>5:1</sup>&#8239;Af&shy;ter we re&shy;turned to our fa&shy;ther, he was filled with joy, and al&shy;so my moth&shy;er was ver&shy;y glad.
    <sup>21</sup>&#8239;We had ob&shy;tained the re&shy;cords which God had com&shy;manded us, and found that they had great val&shy;ue to us, be&shy;cause we could pre&shy;serve the com&shy;mand&shy;ments of God for our chil&shy;dren.
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>7:6</sup>&#8239;As we jour&shy;neyed in the wil&shy;der&shy;ness, La&shy;man and Lem&shy;uel
    <sup>16</sup>&#8239;were an&shy;gry with me, and tried to take a&shy;way my life,
    <sup>19</sup>&#8239;but some of our com&shy;pa&shy;ny plead with them, and they stopped try&shy;ing to take a&shy;way my life.
    <sup>21</sup>&#8239;I for&shy;gave them all that they had done, and we trav&shy;eled a&shy;gain on our jour&shy;ney.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>17:3</sup>&#8239;If the chil&shy;dren of men keep God&#x02BC;s com&shy;mand&shy;ments, he pro&shy;vides means for them to ac&shy;com&shy;plish what he has com&shy;manded.
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>17:5</sup>&#8239;We came to the land which we called Boun&shy;ti&shy;ful, be&shy;cause it had much fruit and wild hon&shy;ey. God had pre&shy;pared all these things that we might not per&shy;ish.
    <sup>6</sup>&#8239;We pitched our tents by the sea&shy;shore, and re&shy;joiced great&shy;ly.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>17:7</sup>&#8239;God said to me, Nephi,
    <sup>8</sup>&#8239;<q>You shall con&shy;struct a ship af&shy;ter the man&shy;ner that I will show you, that I may car&shy;ry your peo&shy;ple a&shy;cross these wa&shy;ters.</q>
    <sup>15</sup>&#8239;There&shy;fore, I la&shy;bored to keep the com&shy;mand&shy;ments of God.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>17:17</sup>&#8239;When my broth&shy;ers saw that I was a&shy;bout to build a ship, they be&shy;gan to grum&shy;ble a&shy;gainst me, say&shy;ing, <q>Our broth&shy;er is a fool, for he thinks that he can build a ship, and cross these great wa&shy;ters.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>17:19</sup>&#8239;I was deep&shy;ly grieved be&shy;cause of the hard&shy;ness of their hearts. When they saw this they were glad, say&shy;ing, <q>We knew that you couldn&#x02BC;t con&shy;struct a ship, and that you lacked judg&shy;ment.
    <sup>20</sup>&#8239;You&#x02BC;re like our fa&shy;ther, led a&shy;way by the fool&shy;ish im&shy;ag&shy;i&shy;na&shy;tions of his heart. He has led us out of the land of Je&shy;ru&shy;sa&shy;lem, and we&#x02BC;ve wan&shy;dered in the wil&shy;der&shy;ness all these years.</q>
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>18:3</sup>&#8239;I, Nephi, of&shy;ten went up on the moun&shy;tain, and I of&shy;ten prayed to God.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>18:4</sup>&#8239;Af&shy;ter I had fin&shy;ished the ship, my broth&shy;ers saw that it was good, and they humbled them&shy;selves a&shy;gain be&shy;fore God.
    <sup>6</sup>&#8239;We pre&shy;pared man&shy;y pro&shy;vi&shy;sions, went in&shy;to the ship with our wives and chil&shy;dren,
    <sup>8</sup>&#8239;and put forth in&shy;to the sea.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>18:23</sup>&#8239;Af&shy;ter we had sailed for man&shy;y days we ar&shy;rived at the prom&shy;ised land.
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>19:1</sup>&#8239;I made plates of o&shy;re on which to en&shy;grave the rec&shy;ord of my peo&shy;ple,
    <sup>5</sup>&#8239;to keep the more sa&shy;cred things for instructing my peo&shy;ple.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>19:7</sup>&#8239;The things which some men es&shy;teem to be of great worth, both to the bod&shy;y and soul, oth&shy;ers set at naught.
    <sup>9</sup>&#8239;The world, be&shy;cause of their in&shy;iq&shy;ui&shy;ty, will judge Jesus to be a thing of naught.
    <sup>18</sup>&#8239;I have writ&shy;ten these things that per&shy;haps I might per&shy;suade my peo&shy;ple to re&shy;mem&shy;ber God.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>22:23</sup>&#8239;For the time soon co&shy;mes that all churches which are built up to make a prof&shy;it, and to get pow&shy;er, and to be&shy;come pop&shy;u&shy;lar in the eyes of the world, must be brought low in the dust.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>22:31</sup>&#8239;If you are o&shy;be&shy;di&shy;ent to the com&shy;mand&shy;ments, and en&shy;dure to the end, you will be saved at the last day.
</p>


<h2 id="2-nephi">2 Nephi</h2>
<p>
    <sup>4:13</sup>&#8239;Not man&shy;y days af&shy;ter Lehi&#x02BC;s death, La&shy;man and Lem&shy;uel were an&shy;gry with me,
    <sup>5:2</sup>&#8239;so they sought to take a&shy;way my life.

<p>
    <sup>5:5</sup>&#8239;God warned me to de&shy;part from them, and flee in&shy;to the wil&shy;der&shy;ness a&shy;long with all those who would go with me.
    <sup>6</sup>&#8239;There&shy;fore, I took my fam&shy;i&shy;ly, and Sam, my old&shy;er broth&shy;er, and Jacob and Jo&shy;seph, my young&shy;er broth&shy;ers, and al&shy;so my sis&shy;ters, and their families.

    <sup>6:1</sup>&#8239;The words of Jacob, the broth&shy;er of Nephi:
</p>

<p>
    <sup>9:27</sup>&#8239;Woe to him who has all the com&shy;mand&shy;ments of God, and transgresses them, and wastes the days of his pro&shy;ba&shy;tion.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>9:28</sup>&#8239;Oh the van&shy;i&shy;ty, and fool&shy;ish&shy;ness of men! When they are learn&shy;ed they think they are wise, and they do not lis&shy;ten to God&#x02BC;s coun&shy;sel, for they set it a&shy;side, sup&shy;pos&shy;ing they know of them&shy;selves, there&shy;fore, their wis&shy;dom is fool&shy;ish&shy;ness and it does not prof&shy;it them.
    <sup>29</sup>&#8239;But to be learn&shy;ed is good if they lis&shy;ten to God&#x02BC;s coun&shy;sels.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>9:30</sup>&#8239;Woe to the rich, who des&shy;pise the poor, and per&shy;se&shy;cute the meek, and whose hearts are on their treas&shy;ures; there&shy;fore, their treas&shy;ure is their God.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>9:34</sup>&#8239;Woe to the li&shy;ar,
    <sup>35</sup>&#8239;to the mur&shy;der&shy;er who kills de&shy;lib&shy;er&shy;ate&shy;ly,
    <sup>36</sup>&#8239;and to those who com&shy;mit for&shy;ni&shy;ca&shy;tion.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>9:39</sup>&#8239;Re&shy;mem&shy;ber, the mind set on the flesh is death, and the mind set on the spir&shy;it is e&shy;ter&shy;nal life.
    <sup>45</sup>&#8239;Turn a&shy;way from your sins.
    <sup>46</sup>&#8239;Pre&shy;pare your souls for the day of judg&shy;ment.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>9:51</sup>&#8239;Do not spend mon&shy;ey on what has no val&shy;ue, nor your la&shy;bor on what can&shy;not sat&shy;is&shy;fy.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>10:23</sup>&#8239;Cheer up your hearts, and re&shy;mem&shy;ber that you are free to act for your&shy;selves: to choose the way of ev&shy;er&shy;last&shy;ing death or the way of e&shy;ter&shy;nal life.
    <sup>24</sup>&#8239;There&shy;fore, rec&shy;on&shy;cile your&shy;selves to the will of God, and not to the will of the flesh.

    <sup>30</sup>&#8239;God has for&shy;bid&shy;den this. There&shy;fore, he has com&shy;manded that all men should have love, and ex&shy;cept they have love they are noth&shy;ing.

<p>
    <sup>26:32</sup>&#8239;God has com&shy;manded men not to mur&shy;der, lie, steal, en&shy;vy, take his name in vain, have mal&shy;ice, con&shy;tend with one an&shy;oth&shy;er, or com&shy;mit for&shy;ni&shy;ca&shy;tion.
    <sup>33</sup>&#8239;None of these iniquities come from God, for he does good a&shy;mong the chil&shy;dren of men.

    <sup>4</sup>&#8239;They will con&shy;tend with one an&shy;oth&shy;er, and their priests will con&shy;tend with one an&shy;oth&shy;er.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>28:8</sup>&#8239;Man&shy;y will say, <q>Eat, drink, and be mer&shy;ry, nev&shy;er&shy;the&shy;less fear God. He will jus&shy;ti&shy;fy in com&shy;mit&shy;ting a lit&shy;tle sin. Lie a lit&shy;tle, take ad&shy;van&shy;tage of one be&shy;cause of his words, dig a pit for your neigh&shy;bor. There is no harm in this. Do all these things, for to&shy;mor&shy;row we die. If we are guilt&shy;y, God will beat us with a few lashes, and at last we will be saved.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>28:12</sup>&#8239;Be&shy;cause of pride their churches have be&shy;come cor&shy;rupted.
    <sup>13</sup>&#8239;They rob the poor be&shy;cause of their fi&shy;ne sanc&shy;tu&shy;ar&shy;ies, and their fi&shy;ne cloth&shy;ing. They per&shy;se&shy;cute the meek and the poor in heart, be&shy;cause in their pride they have be&shy;come ar&shy;ro&shy;gant.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>28:16</sup>&#8239;Woe to those who turn a&shy;side the just for noth&shy;ing, and re&shy;vile a&shy;gainst what is good, and say that it has no worth!

<p>

    <sup>13</sup>&#8239;and prov&shy;i&shy;dence has smiled on you most pleas&shy;ing&shy;ly, that you have ob&shy;tained man&shy;y rich&shy;es. Be&shy;cause some of you have ob&shy;tained more a&shy;bun&shy;dant&shy;ly than oth&shy;ers you are lifted up in the pride of your hearts be&shy;cause of the cost&shy;li&shy;ness of your ap&shy;par&shy;el, and per&shy;se&shy;cute oth&shy;ers be&shy;cause you sup&shy;pose that you are bet&shy;ter than they. 
    <sup>14</sup>&#8239;Do you sup&shy;pose that God justifies you in this thing? No, but he con&shy;demns you, and if you per&shy;sist his judg&shy;ments will speed&shy;i&shy;ly come to you.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:17</sup>&#8239;Think of oth&shy;ers like your&shy;selves, be fa&shy;mil&shy;iar with all, and free with your pos&shy;ses&shy;sions, that they may be rich like you.
    <sup>18</sup>&#8239;But be&shy;fore you seek for rich&shy;es, seek for the king&shy;dom of God.
    <sup>19</sup>&#8239;Af&shy;ter you have ob&shy;tained a hope in Christ you will ob&shy;tain rich&shy;es, if you seek them, and you will seek them with the in&shy;tent to do good: to clothe the na&shy;ked, to feed the hun&shy;gry, to lib&shy;er&shy;ate the cap&shy;tive, and to ad&shy;min&shy;is&shy;ter re&shy;lief to the sick and the af&shy;flicted.
    <sup>21</sup>&#8239;Don&#x02BC;t you sup&shy;pose that one be&shy;ing is as pre&shy;cious in God&#x02BC;s sight as the oth&shy;er?
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:35</sup>&#8239;You have bro&shy;ken your ten&shy;der wives&#x02BC; hearts, and lost your chil&shy;dren&#x02BC;s con&shy;fi&shy;dence, be&shy;cause of your bad ex&shy;am&shy;ples be&shy;fore them. The sob&shy;bing of their hearts as&shy;cends up to God a&shy;gainst you.

<p>
    <sup>1:21</sup>&#8239;There was a strict law a&shy;mong the peo&shy;ple of the church that no one should per&shy;se&shy;cute those who did not be&shy;long to the church.

    <sup>30</sup>&#8239;In their pros&shy;per&shy;ous cir&shy;cum&shy;stances, they did not send a&shy;way any who were na&shy;ked, or hun&shy;gry, or sick.  They did not set their hearts on rich&shy;es, there&shy;fore they were gen&shy;er&shy;ous to all.

<p>
    <sup>5:26</sup>&#8239;If you have ex&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;enced a change of heart, can you feel so now?

    <sup>28</sup>&#8239;Are you strip&shy;ped of pride? If not, you are not pre&shy;pared to meet God.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>5:30</sup>&#8239;Is there one a&shy;mong you who mocks his broth&shy;er, or heaps per&shy;se&shy;cu&shy;tions on him?

<p>
    <sup>7:2</sup>&#8239;If I hadn&#x02BC;t giv&shy;en the judg&shy;ment seat to an&shy;oth&shy;er, to reign in my place, I could not have come at this time.

</p>

<p>
    <sup>6:16</sup>&#8239;The peo&shy;ple grew ver&shy;y wick&shy;ed.

<p>
    <sup>12:4</sup>&#8239;How fool&shy;ish, vain, and quick to do in&shy;iq&shy;ui&shy;ty, and how slow to do good, are the chil&shy;dren of men. How quick to set their hearts on the vain things of the world!

</p>

<p>
    <sup>12:6</sup>&#8239;They ne&shy;glect God&#x02BC;s guid&shy;ance, and will not have him as their guide.

<p>
    <sup>13:26</sup>&#8239;You are worse than they. If a proph&shy;et co&shy;mes to you and de&shy;clares your sins and iniquities, you are an&shy;gry with him, and look for ways to de&shy;stroy him. You will say that he is a false proph&shy;et, be&shy;cause he testifies that your deeds are evil.

<p>
    <sup>13:27</sup>&#8239;But if a man co&shy;mes to you and says, <q>Do this and there is no in&shy;iq&shy;ui&shy;ty. Walk af&shy;ter the pride of your eyes, and do what&shy;ev&shy;er your heart de&shy;sires,</q> you will say that he is a proph&shy;et.

    <sup>12</sup>&#8239;The peo&shy;ple be&shy;gan to be dis&shy;tin&shy;guished by rank, ac&shy;cord&shy;ing to their rich&shy;es and their chances for learn&shy;ing. Some were ig&shy;no&shy;rant be&shy;cause of their pov&shy;er&shy;ty, and oth&shy;ers re&shy;ceived great learn&shy;ing be&shy;cause of their rich&shy;es.
    <sup>14</sup>&#8239;And thus there a&shy;rose a great in&shy;e&shy;qual&shy;i&shy;ty in the land, so the church be&shy;gan to be bro&shy;ken up.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>6:15</sup>&#8239;Now the cause of the in&shy;iq&shy;ui&shy;ty was this: the peo&shy;ple were puffing up with pride, seek&shy;ing for pow&shy;er, au&shy;thor&shy;i&shy;ty, rich&shy;es, and the vain things of the world.
    <sup>18</sup>&#8239;They did not sin ig&shy;no&shy;rant&shy;ly, be&shy;cause God&#x02BC;s will had been taught to them, there&shy;fore they wil&shy;ful&shy;ly rebelled a&shy;gainst God.

<p>
    <sup>7:14</sup>&#8239;The peo&shy;ple di&shy;vid&shy;ed in&shy;to tribes, eve&shy;ry man ac&shy;cord&shy;ing to his fam&shy;i&shy;ly.  They had come to an a&shy;gree&shy;ment that they would not go to war with one an&shy;oth&shy;er, or tres&shy;pass a&shy;gainst one an&shy;oth&shy;er, so in some de&shy;gree they had peace in the land. Nev&shy;er&shy;the&shy;less, their hearts were turned from God, and they stoned the proph&shy;ets and cast them out.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>7:17</sup>&#8239;Nephi preached man&shy;y things to the peo&shy;ple.
    <sup>18</sup>&#8239;They were an&shy;gry with him.
    <sup>21</sup>&#8239;On&shy;ly a few were con&shy;vert&shy;ed to God.
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>11:1</sup>&#8239;A great mul&shy;ti&shy;tude were gath&shy;ered to&shy;geth&shy;er
    <sup>2</sup>&#8239;talking a&shy;bout Jesus Christ.
    <sup>3</sup>&#8239;While they were talking with one an&shy;oth&shy;er, they heard a voice as if it came from heav&shy;en.
    <sup>8</sup>&#8239;They looked up, and saw a man descending out of heav&shy;en. He came down and stood a&shy;mong them.
    <sup>9</sup>&#8239;He reached out his hand and spoke to the peo&shy;ple, say&shy;ing,
    <sup>10</sup>&#8239;<q>I am Jesus Christ, whom the proph&shy;ets tes&shy;ti&shy;fied would come in&shy;to the world.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>11:12</sup>&#8239;When Jesus said these words the whole mul&shy;ti&shy;tude fell to the ground, for they re&shy;mem&shy;bered that it had been prophesied that Christ would show him&shy;self to them.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>11:18</sup>&#8239;Jesus com&shy;manded Nephi to come for&shy;ward,
    <sup>22</sup>&#8239;and called oth&shy;ers, and said to them,
    <sup>28</sup>&#8239;<q>There shall be no dis&shy;putes a&shy;mong you, as there have been un&shy;til now.
    <sup>29</sup>&#8239;For he that has the spir&shy;it of con&shy;ten&shy;tion is not of me, but is of the dev&shy;il, who is the fa&shy;ther of con&shy;ten&shy;tion, and he stirs up the hearts of men to con&shy;tend with an&shy;ger, one with an&shy;oth&shy;er.</q>
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>12:1</sup>&#8239;When Jesus had spo&shy;ken these words to Nephi, and those who had been called, he said to the mul&shy;ti&shy;tude:
</p>

<p>
    <sup>12:3</sup>&#8239;Bless&shy;ed are the poor in spir&shy;it who come to me, for the king&shy;dom of heav&shy;en is theirs.
    <sup>4</sup>&#8239;Bless&shy;ed are all those who mourn, for they will be com&shy;forted.
    <sup>5</sup>&#8239;Bless&shy;ed are the meek, for they will in&shy;her&shy;it the earth.
    <sup>6</sup>&#8239;Bless&shy;ed are all those who hun&shy;ger and thirst for right&shy;eous&shy;ness, for they will be filled with the ho&shy;ly spir&shy;it.
    <sup>7</sup>&#8239;Bless&shy;ed are the mer&shy;ci&shy;ful, for they will re&shy;ceive mer&shy;cy.
    <sup>8</sup>&#8239;Bless&shy;ed are all the pure in heart, for they will see God.
    <sup>9</sup>&#8239;Bless&shy;ed are all the peace&shy;mak&shy;ers, for they will be called sons of God.
    <sup>10</sup>&#8239;Bless&shy;ed are all those who are per&shy;se&shy;cut&shy;ed be&shy;cause of my name, for the king&shy;dom of heav&shy;en is theirs.
    <sup>11</sup>&#8239;Bless&shy;ed are you when peo&shy;ple in&shy;sult you and per&shy;se&shy;cute you, and false&shy;ly say all kinds of evil a&shy;gainst you be&shy;cause of me,
    <sup>12</sup>&#8239;for you will have great joy and be glad, for your re&shy;ward in heav&shy;en will be great; for in the same way they per&shy;se&shy;cut&shy;ed the proph&shy;ets who were be&shy;fore you.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>12:15</sup>&#8239;Do peo&shy;ple light a lamp and put it un&shy;der a bas&shy;ket? No, but on a stand, and it gives light to eve&shy;ry&shy;one in the house.
    <sup>16</sup>&#8239;There&shy;fore let your light shine be&shy;fore this peo&shy;ple, so that they may see your good works and glo&shy;ri&shy;fy God who is in heav&shy;en.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>12:19</sup>&#8239;You have the com&shy;mand&shy;ments.
    <sup>20</sup>&#8239;Un&shy;less you keep my com&shy;mand&shy;ments, you will nev&shy;er en&shy;ter in&shy;to the king&shy;dom of heav&shy;en.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>12:21</sup>&#8239;It is writ&shy;ten that you shall not mur&shy;der, and who&shy;ev&shy;er mur&shy;ders will be sub&shy;ject to God&#x02BC;s judg&shy;ment.
    <sup>22</sup>&#8239;But I tell you that eve&shy;ry&shy;one who is an&shy;gry with his broth&shy;er will be sub&shy;ject to his judg&shy;ment. And who&shy;ev&shy;er says, <q>You fool,</q> will be sub&shy;ject to hell fire.
    <sup>23</sup>&#8239;There&shy;fore, if you want to come to me, and re&shy;mem&shy;ber that your broth&shy;er has some&shy;thing a&shy;gainst you,
    <sup>24</sup>&#8239;go to your broth&shy;er, and first be rec&shy;on&shy;ciled to him, and then come to me with full pur&shy;pose of heart, and I will re&shy;ceive you.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>12:27</sup>&#8239;It is writ&shy;ten that you shall not com&shy;mit a&shy;dul&shy;ter&shy;y.
    <sup>28</sup>&#8239;But I tell you that eve&shy;ry&shy;one who looks at a wom&shy;an with lust for her has al&shy;read&shy;y com&shy;mit&shy;ted a&shy;dul&shy;ter&shy;y in his heart.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>12:29</sup>&#8239;Al&shy;low none of these things to en&shy;ter your heart,
    <sup>30</sup>&#8239;for it is bet&shy;ter to de&shy;ny your&shy;selves these things than to be thrown in&shy;to hell.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>12:33</sup>&#8239;It is writ&shy;ten that you shall not break your oath, but shall ful&shy;fill your oaths to God.
    <sup>34</sup>&#8239;But I tell you, make no oath at all,
    <sup>37</sup>&#8239;but let your state&shy;ment be <q>Yes</q> or <q>No</q>. Any&shy;thing more than this is evil.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>12:38</sup>&#8239;It is writ&shy;ten, an eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth.
    <sup>39</sup>&#8239;But I tell you, don&#x02BC;t re&shy;sist an evil per&shy;son. In&shy;stead, if some&shy;one slaps you on the right cheek, turn to him the oth&shy;er al&shy;so.
    <sup>40</sup>&#8239;If some&shy;one wants to sue you and take your shirt, let him have your coat al&shy;so.
    <sup>41</sup>&#8239;If some&shy;one forces you to go one mile, go with him two.
    <sup>42</sup>&#8239;Give to him who asks you, and don&#x02BC;t turn a&shy;way from him who wants to bor&shy;row from you.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>12:43</sup>&#8239;It is writ&shy;ten, <q>Love your neigh&shy;bor and hate your en&shy;e&shy;my.</q>
    <sup>44</sup>&#8239;But I tell you, love your enemies, bless those who curse you, do good to those who hate you, and pray for those who mis&shy;treat you and per&shy;se&shy;cute you
    <sup>45</sup>&#8239;that you may be sons of God. For he makes his sun rise on the evil and the good.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>13:1</sup>&#8239;You should give to the poor, but be&shy;ware of prac&shy;tic&shy;ing your right&shy;eous&shy;ness be&shy;fore men to be seen by them.
    <sup>2</sup>&#8239;So when you give to the poor, don&#x02BC;t sound a trum&shy;pet be&shy;fore you, as the hyp&shy;o&shy;crites do, to be praised by men. They have their re&shy;ward.
    <sup>3</sup>&#8239;But when you give to the poor, don&#x02BC;t let your left hand know what your right hand is do&shy;ing,
    <sup>4</sup>&#8239;so that your giv&shy;ing may be in se&shy;cret.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>13:5</sup>&#8239;When you pray, don&#x02BC;t do as the hyp&shy;o&shy;crites, for they love to pray to be seen by men. They have their re&shy;ward.
    <sup>6</sup>&#8239;But when you pray, go in&shy;to your room, shut your door, and pray to God who is in se&shy;cret.
    <sup>7</sup>&#8239;When you pray, don&#x02BC;t use mean&shy;ing&shy;less rep&shy;e&shy;ti&shy;tion like the pa&shy;gans, for they think that they will be heard for their man&shy;y words.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>13:16</sup>&#8239;When you fast, don&#x02BC;t look gloom&shy;y like the hyp&shy;o&shy;crites, for they dis&shy;fig&shy;ure their faces to show men that they are fasting. They have their re&shy;ward.
    <sup>17</sup>&#8239;But when you fast, a&shy;noint your head, and wash your face,
    <sup>18</sup>&#8239;so that your fasting is not ob&shy;vi&shy;ous to men, but to God, who is in se&shy;cret.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>13:19</sup>&#8239;Don&#x02BC;t store up for your&shy;selves treas&shy;ures on earth, where moth and rust de&shy;stroy, and thieves break in and steal.
    <sup>20</sup>&#8239;But store up for your&shy;selves treas&shy;ures in heav&shy;en, where nei&shy;ther moth nor rust de&shy;stroys, and where thieves do not break in and steal.
    <sup>21</sup>&#8239;For where your treas&shy;ure is, there your heart will be al&shy;so.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>13:24</sup>&#8239;No one can serve two mas&shy;ters; for ei&shy;ther he will hate the one and love the oth&shy;er, or he will be de&shy;vot&shy;ed to the one and des&shy;pise the oth&shy;er. You can&shy;not serve God and mon&shy;ey.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>14:1</sup>&#8239;Don&#x02BC;t judge, so that you won&#x02BC;t be judged.
    <sup>2</sup>&#8239;For in the way you judge, you will be judged; and with the meas&shy;ure you use, it will be meas&shy;ured to you.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>14:3</sup>&#8239;Why do you look at the speck in your broth&shy;er&#x02BC;s eye, but don&#x02BC;t no&shy;tice the log in your own eye?
    <sup>12</sup>&#8239;There&shy;fore, what&shy;ev&shy;er you want oth&shy;ers to do to you, do al&shy;so to them.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>14:15</sup>&#8239;Be&shy;ware of false proph&shy;ets who come to you in sheep&#x02BC;s cloth&shy;ing, but in&shy;ward&shy;ly are rav&shy;en&shy;ous wolves.
    <sup>16</sup>&#8239;You will rec&shy;og&shy;nize them by their fruits. Are grapes gath&shy;ered from thornbushes, or figs from this&shy;tles?
    <sup>17</sup>&#8239;Like&shy;wise, eve&shy;ry good tree bears good fruit, but a bad tree bears bad fruit.
    <sup>18</sup>&#8239;A good tree can&shy;not bear bad fruit, nor can a bad tree bear good fruit.
    <sup>20</sup>&#8239;So you&#x02BC;ll rec&shy;og&shy;nize them by their fruits.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>14:24</sup>&#8239;Eve&shy;ry&shy;one who hears these words of mine and acts on them will be like a wise man who built his house on the rock.
    <sup>25</sup>&#8239;The rain fell, the floods came, and the winds blew and beat a&shy;gainst that house. Yet it did not fall, be&shy;cause its founda&shy;tion was on the rock.

<p>
    <sup>14:26</sup>&#8239;Eve&shy;ry&shy;one who hears these words of mine and doesn&#x02BC;t act on them, will be like a fool&shy;ish man who built his house on the sand.
    <sup>27</sup>&#8239;The rain fell, the floods came, and the winds blew and beat a&shy;gainst that house, and it fell.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>15:9</sup>&#8239;Turn to me, and en&shy;dure to the end, and you will live. For to him who en&shy;dures to the end, I will give e&shy;ter&shy;nal life.
    <sup>10</sup>&#8239;I&#x02BC;ve giv&shy;en you the com&shy;mand&shy;ments, there&shy;fore keep my com&shy;mand&shy;ments.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>17:2</sup>&#8239;I can see that you&#x02BC;re weak, that you can&shy;not un&shy;der&shy;stand all that I&#x02BC;m speak&shy;ing to you.
    <sup>3</sup>&#8239;There&shy;fore, go to your homes, and pon&shy;der on the things which I&#x02BC;ve said, and ask God that you may un&shy;der&shy;stand.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>18:18</sup>&#8239;You must watch and pray al&shy;ways to a&shy;void temp&shy;ta&shy;tion.
    <sup>21</sup>&#8239;Pray to God in your families that your wives and your chil&shy;dren may be bless&shy;ed.

<p>
    <sup>8:3</sup>&#8239;Our enemies killed my fa&shy;ther, and I a&shy;lone re&shy;main to write the sad tale of the de&shy;struc&shy;tion of my peo&shy;ple.  I don&#x02BC;t know wheth&shy;er they will kill me.
    <sup>5</sup>&#8239;All my rel&shy;a&shy;tives have been killed in bat&shy;tle, and I have no friends, and no&shy;where to go.

    <sup>19</sup>&#8239;for one who judges rash&shy;ly will be judged rash&shy;ly a&shy;gain; for his wages will be ac&shy;cord&shy;ing to his works.
    <sup>20</sup>&#8239;The scrip&shy;ture says, <q><q>Man shall not strike, nei&shy;ther shall he judge, for judg&shy;ment is mine, and venge&shy;ance is mine al&shy;so, and I will re&shy;pay,</q> says God.</q>

    <sup>37</sup>&#8239;For you love mon&shy;ey, and your pos&shy;ses&shy;sions, and your fi&shy;ne cloth&shy;ing, and adorning your churches, more than you love the poor and the needy, the sick and the af&shy;flicted.

<p>
    <sup>7:1</sup>&#8239;I, Moroni, write some of the words of my fa&shy;ther Mormon.
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>7:2</sup>&#8239;I, Mormon, speak to you.
    <sup>5</sup>&#8239;I re&shy;mem&shy;ber God&#x02BC;s word, which says you will rec&shy;og&shy;nize them by their works, for if their works are good then they are al&shy;so good.
    <sup>6</sup>&#8239;For God has said, an evil man can&shy;not do what is good.  For if he of&shy;fers a gift, or prays to God, un&shy;less he does it with re&shy;al in&shy;tent he gains noth&shy;ing,
    <sup>7</sup>&#8239;for it is not counted to him as right&shy;eous&shy;ness.
    <sup>8</sup>&#8239;For if an evil man gives a gift, he does it re&shy;luc&shy;tant&shy;ly, there&shy;fore it is counted to him the same as if he had re&shy;tained the gift, there&shy;fore he is counted evil be&shy;fore God.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>7:9</sup>&#8239;Like&shy;wise, it is counted evil to a man if he prays with&shy;out re&shy;al in&shy;tent of heart. He gains noth&shy;ing, for God re&shy;ceives none such.
    <sup>10</sup>&#8239;There&shy;fore, an evil man can&shy;not do what is good.
    <sup>11</sup>&#8239;A bit&shy;ter spring can&shy;not pour out good wa&shy;ter; nei&shy;ther can a good spring pour out bit&shy;ter wa&shy;ter.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>7:13</sup>&#8239;That which is of God in&shy;vites and en&shy;tices to do good con&shy;tin&shy;u&shy;al&shy;ly. There&shy;fore, eve&shy;ry&shy;thing which in&shy;vites and en&shy;tices to do good, to love God, and to serve him, is in&shy;spired of God.
    <sup>14</sup>&#8239;Be on guard that you don&#x02BC;t judge what is evil to be of God, or what is good and of God to be of the dev&shy;il.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>7:18</sup>&#8239;See that you don&#x02BC;t judge un&shy;just&shy;ly, for with the same judg&shy;ment that you judge you will al&shy;so be judged.
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>7:44</sup>&#8239;If a man doesn&#x02BC;t have love he is noth&shy;ing.
    <sup>45</sup>&#8239;Love is pa&shy;tient, is kind, does not en&shy;vy, is not ar&shy;ro&shy;gant, is not self-seek&shy;ing, is not ir&shy;ri&shy;ta&shy;ble, keeps no rec&shy;ord of wrongs, does not re&shy;joice in unrighteousness but re&shy;joices in the truth, bears all things, be&shy;lieves all things, hopes all things, and en&shy;dures all things.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>7:46</sup>&#8239;There&shy;fore, love nev&shy;er ends. Hold fast to love, which is the great&shy;est of all, for all things must end,
    <sup>47</sup>&#8239;but love en&shy;dures for&shy;ev&shy;er, and who&shy;ev&shy;er possesses it at the last day, it will go well with him.

    <sup>10:1</sup>&#8239;Now I, Moroni,
    <sup>3</sup>&#8239;ex&shy;hort you that when you read these things, you should re&shy;mem&shy;ber how mer&shy;ci&shy;ful God has been to the chil&shy;dren of men, and pon&shy;der it in your hearts.

    <sup>10:8</sup>&#8239;Don&#x02BC;t de&shy;ny the gifts of God, for they are man&shy;y, and they come from the same God. There are dif&shy;fer&shy;ent ways that these gifts are ad&shy;min&shy;is&shy;tered, but it is the same God who works all things in all men, and they are giv&shy;en to prof&shy;it men.
    <sup>9</sup>&#8239;To one is giv&shy;en that he may teach a mes&shy;sage of wis&shy;dom,
    <sup>10</sup>&#8239;to an&shy;oth&shy;er teach&shy;ing a mes&shy;sage of knowl&shy;edge,
    <sup>11</sup>&#8239;to an&shy;oth&shy;er ver&shy;y great faith, to an&shy;oth&shy;er the gifts of heal&shy;ing,
    <sup>12</sup>&#8239;to an&shy;oth&shy;er work&shy;ing might&shy;y mir&shy;a&shy;cles,
    <sup>13</sup>&#8239;to an&shy;oth&shy;er proph&shy;e&shy;sy a&shy;bout all things,
    <sup>14</sup>&#8239;to an&shy;oth&shy;er see&shy;ing an&shy;gels and ministering spir&shy;its,
    <sup>15</sup>&#8239;to an&shy;oth&shy;er all kinds of tongues,
    <sup>16</sup>&#8239;and to an&shy;oth&shy;er the in&shy;ter&shy;pre&shy;ta&shy;tion of lan&shy;guages.
    <sup>17</sup>&#8239;All these gifts come from God to eve&shy;ry man in&shy;di&shy;vid&shy;u&shy;al&shy;ly, as he wills.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>10:21</sup>&#8239;Un&shy;less you have love, faith, and hope, you can&shy;not be saved.
    <sup>22</sup>&#8239;If you don&#x02BC;t have hope you must be in des&shy;pair, and des&shy;pair co&shy;mes be&shy;cause of in&shy;iq&shy;ui&shy;ty.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>10:34</sup>&#8239;I say to all, fare&shy;well. I soon go to rest in God&#x02BC;s par&shy;a&shy;dise.
