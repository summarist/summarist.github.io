                <sup>1:4</sup>&#8239;John the Baptist appeared in the wil­der­ness, preaching a bap­tism of re­pent­ance for the for­give­ness of sins.
                <sup>5</sup>&#8239;All the peo­ple were go­ing out to him and were be­ing bap­tized by him in the riv­er Jor­dan, con­fess­ing their sins.
                <sup>6</sup>&#8239;John was clothed with camelʼs hair, wore a leath­er belt a­round his waist, and ate locusts and wild hon­ey.
            </p>
            <p>
                <sup>1:7</sup>&#8239;He preached, say­ing, “Af­ter me co­mes he who is might­i­er than I. Iʼm not wor­thy to stoop down and un­tie the strap of his sandals.
                <sup>8</sup>&#8239;I bap­tized you with wa­ter, but heʼll bap­tize you with the ho­ly spir­it.”

            <p>
                <sup>1:9</sup>&#8239;In those days Jesus was bap­tized by John in the Jor­dan.
                <sup>10</sup>&#8239;Just as he was com­ing up out of the wa­ter, he saw the heavens be­ing torn o­pen and the spir­it descending on him like a dove.
                <sup>11</sup>&#8239;And a voice came out of the heavens, “You are my be­lov­ed son; with you I am well pleased.”
            </p>
            <p>
                <sup>1:12</sup>&#8239;Im­me­di­ate­ly the spir­it drove him in­to the wil­der­ness.
                <sup>13</sup>&#8239;He was in the wil­der­ness for­ty days, be­ing tempted by the temp­ter. He was with the wild animals, and the angels ministered to him.
            </p>
            <p>
                <sup>1:14</sup>&#8239;Af­ter John was arrested, Jesus came in­to Gal­i­lee, preaching the gos­pel of God,
                <sup>15</sup>&#8239;and say­ing, “The time is ful­filled, and Godʼs king­dom is at hand. Re­pent and be­lieve in the gos­pel.”

            <p>
                <sup>1:16</sup>&#8239;Walk­ing a­long by the Sea of Gal­i­lee, he saw Simon and Andrew the broth­er of Simon cast­ing a net in­to the sea, for they were fishermen.
                <sup>17</sup>&#8239;Jesus said to them, “Come, fol­low me, and Iʼll make you be­come fishers of men.”
                <sup>18</sup>&#8239;Im­me­di­ate­ly they left the nets, and followed him.
            </p>
            <p>
                <sup>1:19</sup>&#8239;Go­ing on a lit­tle far­ther, he saw James the son of Zebedee, and John his broth­er, who were in the boat mend­ing their nets.
                <sup>20</sup>&#8239;Im­me­di­ate­ly he called them, and they left their fa­ther Zebedee in the boat with the hired servants, and followed him.
            </p>
            
            <div class="scene"></div>
            
            <p>
                <sup>1:29</sup>&#8239;They entered the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John.
            </p>
            <p>
                <sup>1:30</sup>&#8239;Now Simonʼs mother-in-law lay sick with a fe­ver, and im­me­di­ate­ly they told him a­bout her.
                <sup>31</sup>&#8239;He came, took her by the hand, and helped her up. The fe­ver left her, and she be­gan to wait on them.
            </p>
            <p>
                <sup>1:32</sup>&#8239;That eve­ning, af­ter the sun had set, they brought to him all who were sick and pos­sessed by demons.
                <sup>33</sup>&#8239;The whole cit­y gathered to­geth­er at the door.
                <sup>34</sup>&#8239;He healed man­y who were sick with var­i­ous diseases, and cast out man­y demons. He would not al­low the demons to speak, be­cause they knew him.
                <sup>39</sup>&#8239;He went in­to their synagogues through­out all Gal­i­lee, preaching and cast­ing out demons.
            </p>
            
            <div class="scene"></div>
            
            <p>
                <sup>1:40</sup>&#8239;A lep­er came to him, and kneel­ing said to him, “If youʼre will­ing, you can make me clean.”
            </p>
            <p>
                <sup>1:41</sup>&#8239;Moved with com­pas­sion, he touched him, and said to him, “I am will­ing. Be clean.”
                <sup>42</sup>&#8239;Im­me­di­ate­ly the lep­ro­sy left him, and he was cleansed.
                <sup>43</sup>&#8239;Jesus sent him a­way at once and sternly warned him,
                <sup>44</sup>&#8239;“Say noth­ing to any­one, but go show your­self to the priest and of­fer for your cleans­ing what Mo­ses commanded, as a tes­ti­mo­ny to them.”
            </p>
            <p>
                <sup>1:45</sup>&#8239;But he went out and be­gan to talk free­ly a­bout it, spreading the news, so that Jesus could no long­er en­ter a cit­y pub­lic­ly, but stayed out in de­sert­ed places, and peo­ple came to him from eve­ry­where.

            <div class="scene"></div>
            
            <p>
                <sup>2:1</sup>&#8239;When he returned to Capernaum some days lat­er, peo­ple heard that he was at home.
                <sup>2</sup>&#8239;Man­y were gathered to­geth­er, so that there was no more room for them, not e­ven near the door. He preached the word to them.
                <sup>3</sup>&#8239;They came, bring­ing to him a par­a­lyt­ic, car­ried by four of them.
                <sup>4</sup>&#8239;When they could not come near him be­cause of the crowd, they re­moved the roof a­bove him, made an o­pen­ing, and let down the mat on which the par­a­lyt­ic was ly­ing.
                <sup>5</sup>&#8239;When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the par­a­lyt­ic, “Son, your sins are for­giv­en.”
            </p>
            <p>
                <sup>2:6</sup>&#8239;But some of the scribes were sit­ting there, think­ing to them­selves,
                <sup>7</sup>&#8239;“Why does he talk like that? Heʼs blas­phem­ing. Who can for­give sins but God a­lone?”
            </p>
            <p>
                <sup>2:8</sup>&#8239;Im­me­di­ate­ly Jesus perceived in his spir­it what they were think­ing, and said to them, “Why do you ques­tion these things in your hearts?
                <sup>9</sup>&#8239;Which is eas­i­er, to say to the par­a­lyt­ic, ‘Your sins are for­giv­en,’ or to say, ‘Rise, pick up your mat, and walk’?
                <sup>10</sup>&#8239;But that you may know that the son of man has au­thor­i­ty on earth to for­give sins,” he said to the par­a­lyt­ic,
                <sup>11</sup>&#8239;“I tell you, Rise, pick up your mat, and go home.”
            </p>
            <p>
                <sup>2:12</sup>&#8239;He got up, im­me­di­ate­ly pick­ed up the mat, and went out in front of them all, so that they were all a­mazed, and glo­ri­fied God, say­ing, “Weʼve nev­er seen any­thing like this.”
            </p>
            
            <div class="scene"></div>
            
            <p>
                <sup>2:13</sup>&#8239;He went out a­gain be­side the sea, and all the crowd came to him, and he taught them.
                <sup>14</sup>&#8239;As he passed by, he saw Levi the son of Alphaeus sit­ting in the tax booth, and said to him, “Fol­low me.” He got up and followed him.
            </p>
            <p>
                <sup>2:15</sup>&#8239;As he re­clined at the ta­ble in his house, man­y tax collectors and sinners re­clined with Jesus and his disciples, for there were man­y who followed him.
                <sup>16</sup>&#8239;The scribes of the Pharisees asked his disciples, “Why does he eat with tax collectors and sinners?”
            </p>
            <p>
                <sup>2:17</sup>&#8239;When Jesus heard it, he said to them, “Those who are health­y donʼt need a doc­tor, but those who are sick. I did­nʼt come to call the right­eous, but sinners.”
            </p>

            <p>
                <sup>2:18</sup>&#8239;Some peo­ple came and asked him, “Why do Johnʼs disciples and the disciples of the Pharisees fast, but your disciples donʼt fast?”
            </p>
            <p>
                <sup>2:19</sup>&#8239;Jesus said to them, “Can wed­ding guests fast while the groom is with them? As long as they have the groom with them, they canʼt fast.
                <sup>20</sup>&#8239;The days will come, when the groom is tak­en a­way from them, and then they will fast in that day.”

            <p>
                <sup>2:23</sup>&#8239;One Sabbath he was go­ing through the grainfields, and his disciples be­gan to pluck some heads of grain as they went.
                <sup>24</sup>&#8239;The Pharisees said to him, “Look. Why are they do­ing whatʼs un­law­ful on the Sabbath?”
            </p>
            <p>
                <sup>2:25</sup>&#8239;He said to them, “Have­nʼt you read what David did when he and his companions were in need and hun­gry?
                <sup>26</sup>&#8239;He entered the house of God and ate the con­se­crat­ed bread, which is on­ly law­ful for the priests to eat, and he al­so gave some to his companions.”
            </p>
            <p>
                <sup>2:27</sup>&#8239;He said to them, “The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath.”

            <div class="scene"></div>
            
            <p>
                <sup>3:1</sup>&#8239;He entered the syn­a­gogue a­gain, and a man with a withered hand was there.
                <sup>2</sup>&#8239;They watched Jesus to see if he would heal him on the Sabbath, so that they might ac­cuse him.
            </p>
            <p>
                <sup>3:3</sup>&#8239;He said to the man with the withered hand, “Come for­ward.”
                <sup>4</sup>&#8239;He asked them, “Is it law­ful on the Sabbath to do good or to do harm, to save life or to kill?” But they were si­lent.
            </p>
            <p>
                <sup>3:5</sup>&#8239;He looked a­round at them with an­ger, grieved at the hard­ness of their hearts, and said to the man, “Stretch out your hand.” He stretched it out, and his hand was re­stored.
                <sup>6</sup>&#8239;The Pharisees went out and im­me­di­ate­ly held coun­sel with the Herodians a­gainst him, how to de­stroy him.

                <sup>3:7</sup>&#8239;Jesus with­drew with his disciples to the sea, and a large crowd followed him.
                <sup>8</sup>&#8239;Hear­ing the great things he did, a large crowd came to him.
            </p>
            <p>
                <sup>3:9</sup>&#8239;Be­cause of the crowd, he told his disciples to have a boat wait for him, so they would­nʼt crush him.
                <sup>10</sup>&#8239;Since he had healed so man­y, eve­ry­one who had diseases pressed a­round him to tou­ch him.
                <sup>11</sup>&#8239;When­ev­er the un­clean spirits saw him, they fell down in front of him, and cried out, “You are the son of God.”
                <sup>12</sup>&#8239;And he sternly ordered them not to make him known.

                <sup>14</sup>&#8239;He ap­point­ed twelve, whom he al­so named apostles, to be with him, and to send them out to preach,
                <sup>15</sup>&#8239;and to have au­thor­i­ty to cast out demons.

            <p>
                <sup>3:23</sup>&#8239;He called them o­ver to him, and said to them in parables, “How can the temp­ter cast out the temp­ter?

                <sup>25</sup>&#8239;It was nine in the morn­ing when they cru­ci­fied him.
                <sup>26</sup>&#8239;The in­scrip­tion of the charge a­gainst him read, “The King of the Jews.”
                <sup>27</sup>&#8239;They cru­ci­fied two robbers with him, one on his right and one on his left.

                <sup>15:29</sup>&#8239;Those who passed by de­rid­ed him, shak­ing their heads, and say­ing, “Ha! You who would de­stroy the tem­ple and re­build it in three days,

                <sup>15:31</sup>&#8239;In the same way, the chief priests and the scribes mocked him to one an­oth­er say­ing, “He saved others. He canʼt save him­self.

                <sup>44</sup>&#8239;Pilate was sur­prised that he was al­read­y dead.

                <sup>2</sup>&#8239;Ver­y ear­ly on the first day of the week, when the sun had ris­en, they went to the tomb.
