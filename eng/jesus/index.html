    <p>
    <sup>1:4</sup>&#8239;John the Baptist ap&shy;peared in the wil&shy;der&shy;ness, preaching a bap&shy;tism of re&shy;pent&shy;ance for the for&shy;give&shy;ness of sins.
    <sup>5</sup>&#8239;All the peo&shy;ple were go&shy;ing out to him and were be&shy;ing bap&shy;tized by him in the riv&shy;er Jor&shy;dan, con&shy;fess&shy;ing their sins.
    <sup>6</sup>&#8239;John was clothed with cam&shy;el&#x02BC;s hair, wore a leath&shy;er belt a&shy;round his waist, and ate lo&shy;custs and wild hon&shy;ey.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>1:7</sup>&#8239;He preached, say&shy;ing, <q>Af&shy;ter me co&shy;mes he who is might&shy;i&shy;er than I. I&#x02BC;m not wor&shy;thy to stoop down and un&shy;tie the strap of his san&shy;dals.
    <sup>8</sup>&#8239;I bap&shy;tized you with wa&shy;ter, but he&#x02BC;ll bap&shy;tize you with the ho&shy;ly spir&shy;it.</q>
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>1:9</sup>&#8239;In those days Jesus was bap&shy;tized by John in the Jor&shy;dan.
    <sup>10</sup>&#8239;Just as he was com&shy;ing up out of the wa&shy;ter, he saw the heav&shy;ens be&shy;ing torn o&shy;pen and the spir&shy;it descending on him like a dove.
    <sup>11</sup>&#8239;And a voice came out of the heav&shy;ens, <q>You are my be&shy;lov&shy;ed son; with you I am well pleased.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>1:12</sup>&#8239;Im&shy;me&shy;di&shy;ate&shy;ly the spir&shy;it drove him in&shy;to the wil&shy;der&shy;ness.
    <sup>13</sup>&#8239;He was in the wil&shy;der&shy;ness for&shy;ty days, be&shy;ing tempted by the temp&shy;ter. He was with the wild an&shy;i&shy;mals, and the an&shy;gels min&shy;is&shy;tered to him.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>1:14</sup>&#8239;Af&shy;ter John was ar&shy;rested, Jesus came in&shy;to Gal&shy;i&shy;lee, preaching the gos&shy;pel of God,
    <sup>15</sup>&#8239;and say&shy;ing, <q>The time is ful&shy;filled, and God&#x02BC;s king&shy;dom is at hand. Re&shy;pent and be&shy;lieve in the gos&shy;pel.</q>
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>1:16</sup>&#8239;Walk&shy;ing a&shy;long by the Sea of Gal&shy;i&shy;lee, he saw Simon and Andrew the broth&shy;er of Simon cast&shy;ing a net in&shy;to the sea, for they were fishermen.
    <sup>17</sup>&#8239;Jesus said to them, <q>Come, fol&shy;low me, and I&#x02BC;ll make you be&shy;come fish&shy;ers of men.</q>
    <sup>18</sup>&#8239;Im&shy;me&shy;di&shy;ate&shy;ly they left the nets, and fol&shy;lowed him.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>1:19</sup>&#8239;Go&shy;ing on a lit&shy;tle far&shy;ther, he saw James the son of Zebedee, and John his broth&shy;er, who were in the boat mend&shy;ing their nets.
    <sup>20</sup>&#8239;Im&shy;me&shy;di&shy;ate&shy;ly he called them, and they left their fa&shy;ther Zebedee in the boat with the hired serv&shy;ants, and fol&shy;lowed him.
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>1:29</sup>&#8239;They en&shy;tered the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>1:30</sup>&#8239;Now Simon&#x02BC;s moth&shy;er-in-law lay sick with a fe&shy;ver, and im&shy;me&shy;di&shy;ate&shy;ly they told him a&shy;bout her.
    <sup>31</sup>&#8239;He came, took her by the hand, and helped her up. The fe&shy;ver left her, and she be&shy;gan to wait on them.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>1:32</sup>&#8239;That eve&shy;ning, af&shy;ter the sun had set, they brought to him all who were sick and pos&shy;sessed by de&shy;mons.
    <sup>33</sup>&#8239;The whole cit&shy;y gath&shy;ered to&shy;geth&shy;er at the door.
    <sup>34</sup>&#8239;He healed man&shy;y who were sick with var&shy;i&shy;ous dis&shy;eases, and cast out man&shy;y de&shy;mons. He would not al&shy;low the de&shy;mons to speak, be&shy;cause they knew him.
    <sup>39</sup>&#8239;He went in&shy;to their syn&shy;a&shy;gogues through&shy;out all Gal&shy;i&shy;lee, preaching and cast&shy;ing out de&shy;mons.
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>1:40</sup>&#8239;A lep&shy;er came to him, and kneel&shy;ing said to him, <q>If you&#x02BC;re will&shy;ing, you can make me clean.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>1:41</sup>&#8239;Moved with com&shy;pas&shy;sion, he tou&shy;ched him, and said to him, <q>I am will&shy;ing. Be clean.</q>
    <sup>42</sup>&#8239;Im&shy;me&shy;di&shy;ate&shy;ly the lep&shy;ro&shy;sy left him, and he was cleansed.
    <sup>43</sup>&#8239;Jesus sent him a&shy;way at once and sternly warned him,
    <sup>44</sup>&#8239;<q>Say noth&shy;ing to any&shy;one, but go show your&shy;self to the priest and of&shy;fer for your cleans&shy;ing what Mo&shy;ses com&shy;manded, as a tes&shy;ti&shy;mo&shy;ny to them.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>1:45</sup>&#8239;But he went out and be&shy;gan to talk free&shy;ly a&shy;bout it, spreading the news, so that Jesus could no long&shy;er en&shy;ter a cit&shy;y pub&shy;lic&shy;ly, but stayed out in de&shy;sert&shy;ed places, and peo&shy;ple came to him from eve&shy;ry&shy;where.
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>2:1</sup>&#8239;When he re&shy;turned to Capernaum some days lat&shy;er, peo&shy;ple heard that he was at home.
    <sup>2</sup>&#8239;Man&shy;y were gath&shy;ered to&shy;geth&shy;er, so that there was no more room for them, not e&shy;ven near the door.  He preached the word to them.
    <sup>3</sup>&#8239;They came, bring&shy;ing to him a par&shy;a&shy;lyt&shy;ic, car&shy;ried by four of them.
    <sup>4</sup>&#8239;When they could not come near him be&shy;cause of the crowd, they re&shy;moved the roof a&shy;bove him, made an o&shy;pen&shy;ing, and let down the mat on which the par&shy;a&shy;lyt&shy;ic was ly&shy;ing.
    <sup>5</sup>&#8239;When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the par&shy;a&shy;lyt&shy;ic, <q>Son, your sins are for&shy;giv&shy;en.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:6</sup>&#8239;But some of the scr&shy;ibes were sit&shy;ting there, think&shy;ing to them&shy;selves,
    <sup>7</sup>&#8239;<q>Why does he talk like that? He&#x02BC;s blas&shy;phem&shy;ing. Who can for&shy;give sins but God a&shy;lone?</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:8</sup>&#8239;Im&shy;me&shy;di&shy;ate&shy;ly Jesus perceived in his spir&shy;it what they were think&shy;ing, and said to them, <q>Why do you ques&shy;tion these things in your hearts?
    <sup>9</sup>&#8239;Which is eas&shy;i&shy;er, to say to the par&shy;a&shy;lyt&shy;ic, <q>Your sins are for&shy;giv&shy;en</q>, or to say, <q>Rise, pick up your mat, and walk?</q>
    <sup>10</sup>&#8239;But that you may know that the son of man has au&shy;thor&shy;i&shy;ty on earth to for&shy;give sins</q>, he said to the par&shy;a&shy;lyt&shy;ic,
    <sup>11</sup>&#8239;<q>I tell you, Rise, pick up your mat, and go home.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:12</sup>&#8239;He got up, im&shy;me&shy;di&shy;ate&shy;ly pick&shy;ed up the mat, and went out in front of them all, so that they were all a&shy;mazed, and glo&shy;ri&shy;fied God, say&shy;ing, <q>We&#x02BC;ve nev&shy;er seen any&shy;thing like this.</q>
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>2:13</sup>&#8239;He went out a&shy;gain be&shy;side the sea, and all the crowd came to him, and he taught them.
    <sup>14</sup>&#8239;As he passed by, he saw Levi the son of Alphaeus sit&shy;ting in the tax booth, and said to him, <q>Fol&shy;low me.</q> He got up and fol&shy;lowed him.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:15</sup>&#8239;As he re&shy;clined at the ta&shy;ble in his house, man&shy;y tax col&shy;lec&shy;tors and sin&shy;ners re&shy;clined with Jesus and his dis&shy;ci&shy;ples, for there were man&shy;y who fol&shy;lowed him.
    <sup>16</sup>&#8239;The scr&shy;ibes of the Pharisees asked his dis&shy;ci&shy;ples, <q>Why does he eat with tax col&shy;lec&shy;tors and sin&shy;ners?</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:17</sup>&#8239;When Jesus heard it, he said to them, <q>Those who are health&shy;y don&#x02BC;t need a doc&shy;tor, but those who are sick. I didn&#x02BC;t come to call the right&shy;eous, but sin&shy;ners.</q>
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>2:18</sup>&#8239;Some peo&shy;ple came and asked him, <q>Why do John&#x02BC;s dis&shy;ci&shy;ples and the dis&shy;ci&shy;ples of the Pharisees fast, but your dis&shy;ci&shy;ples don&#x02BC;t fast?</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:19</sup>&#8239;Jesus said to them, <q>Can wed&shy;ding guests fast while the groom is with them? As long as they have the groom with them, they can&#x02BC;t fast.
    <sup>20</sup>&#8239;The days will come, when the groom is tak&shy;en a&shy;way from them, and then they will fast in that day.</q>
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>2:23</sup>&#8239;One Sabbath he was go&shy;ing through the grain&shy;fields, and his dis&shy;ci&shy;ples be&shy;gan to pluck some heads of grain as they went.
    <sup>24</sup>&#8239;The Pharisees said to him, <q>Look. Why are they do&shy;ing what&#x02BC;s un&shy;law&shy;ful on the Sabbath?</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:25</sup>&#8239;He said to them, <q>Hav&shy;en&#x02BC;t you read what David did when he and his com&shy;pan&shy;ions were in need and hun&shy;gry?
    <sup>26</sup>&#8239;He en&shy;tered the house of God and ate the con&shy;se&shy;crat&shy;ed bread, which is on&shy;ly law&shy;ful for the priests to eat, and he al&shy;so gave some to his com&shy;pan&shy;ions.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:27</sup>&#8239;He said to them, <q>The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath.</q>
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>3:1</sup>&#8239;He en&shy;tered the syn&shy;a&shy;gogue a&shy;gain, and a man with a with&shy;ered hand was there.
    <sup>2</sup>&#8239;They watched Jesus to see if he would heal him on the Sabbath, so that they might ac&shy;cuse him.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>3:3</sup>&#8239;He said to the man with the with&shy;ered hand, <q>Come for&shy;ward.</q>
    <sup>4</sup>&#8239;He asked them, <q>Is it law&shy;ful on the Sabbath to do good or to do harm, to save life or to kill?</q> But they were si&shy;lent.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>3:5</sup>&#8239;He looked a&shy;round at them with an&shy;ger, grieved at the hard&shy;ness of their hearts, and said to the man, <q>Stretch out your hand.</q> He stretched it out, and his hand was re&shy;stored.
    <sup>6</sup>&#8239;The Pharisees went out and im&shy;me&shy;di&shy;ate&shy;ly held coun&shy;sel with the Herodians a&shy;gainst him, how to de&shy;stroy him.
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>3:7</sup>&#8239;Jesus with&shy;drew with his dis&shy;ci&shy;ples to the sea, and a large crowd fol&shy;lowed him.
    <sup>8</sup>&#8239;Hear&shy;ing the great things he did, a large crowd came to him.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>3:9</sup>&#8239;Be&shy;cause of the crowd, he told his dis&shy;ci&shy;ples to have a boat wait for him, so they wouldn&#x02BC;t crush him.
    <sup>10</sup>&#8239;Since he had healed so man&shy;y, eve&shy;ry&shy;one who had dis&shy;eases pressed a&shy;round him to tou&shy;ch him.
    <sup>11</sup>&#8239;When&shy;ev&shy;er the un&shy;clean spir&shy;its saw him, they fell down in front of him, and cried out, <q>You are the son of God.</q>
    <sup>12</sup>&#8239;And he sternly or&shy;dered them not to make him known.
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>3:13</sup>&#8239;He went up on the moun&shy;tain and sum&shy;moned those he wanted, and they came to him.
    <sup>14</sup>&#8239;He ap&shy;point&shy;ed twelve, whom he al&shy;so named a&shy;pos&shy;tles, to be with him, and to send them out to preach,
    <sup>15</sup>&#8239;and to have au&shy;thor&shy;i&shy;ty to cast out de&shy;mons.
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>3:22</sup>&#8239;The scr&shy;ibes said, <q>He casts out de&shy;mons by the prince of de&shy;mons.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>3:23</sup>&#8239;He called them o&shy;ver to him, and said to them in par&shy;a&shy;bles, <q>How can the temp&shy;ter cast out the temp&shy;ter?
    <sup>24</sup>&#8239;If a king&shy;dom is di&shy;vid&shy;ed a&shy;gainst it&shy;self, that king&shy;dom can&shy;not stand.
    <sup>25</sup>&#8239;If a house is di&shy;vid&shy;ed a&shy;gainst it&shy;self, that house will not be a&shy;ble to stand.
    <sup>26</sup>&#8239;If the temp&shy;ter has ris&shy;en up a&shy;gainst him&shy;self, and is di&shy;vid&shy;ed, he can&shy;not stand, but is fin&shy;ished.
    <sup>27</sup>&#8239;No one can en&shy;ter a strong man&#x02BC;s house, and plun&shy;der his goods, un&shy;less he first ties up the strong man, and then he can plun&shy;der his house.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>3:28</sup>&#8239;<q>Tru&shy;ly I say to you, the sons of men will be for&shy;giv&shy;en all sins and what&shy;ev&shy;er blasphemies they speak,
    <sup>29</sup>&#8239;but who&shy;ev&shy;er blas&shy;phemes a&shy;gainst the ho&shy;ly spir&shy;it will nev&shy;er be for&shy;giv&shy;en, but is guilt&shy;y of an e&shy;ter&shy;nal sin,</q>
    <sup>30</sup>&#8239;be&shy;cause they said, <q>He has an un&shy;clean spir&shy;it.</q>
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>3:32</sup>&#8239;A crowd was sit&shy;ting a&shy;round him, and said to him, <q>Your moth&shy;er and broth&shy;ers are out&shy;side looking for you.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>3:33</sup>&#8239;He an&shy;swered them, <q>Who are my moth&shy;er and my broth&shy;ers?</q>
    <sup>34</sup>&#8239;Looking at those seated a&shy;round him, he said, <q>Here are my moth&shy;er and my broth&shy;ers.
    <sup>35</sup>&#8239;Who&shy;ev&shy;er does the will of God, he is my broth&shy;er and sis&shy;ter and moth&shy;er.</q>
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>4:1</sup>&#8239;He be&shy;gan to teach by the sea a&shy;gain. A ver&shy;y great crowd gath&shy;ered a&shy;round him, so he got in&shy;to a boat on the sea and sat down.  The whole crowd was by the sea on the land.
    <sup>2</sup>&#8239;He taught them man&shy;y things in par&shy;a&shy;bles, and in his teach&shy;ing said to them,
    <sup>3</sup>&#8239;<q>A sower went out to sow.
    <sup>4</sup>&#8239;As he sowed, some seed fell a&shy;long the path, and the birds came and de&shy;voured it.
    <sup>5</sup>&#8239;Oth&shy;er seed fell on rock&shy;y ground, where it had lit&shy;tle soil.  It sprang up quick&shy;ly, be&shy;cause it had no depth of soil.
    <sup>6</sup>&#8239;When the sun rose, it was scorched. Be&shy;cause it had no root, it with&shy;ered a&shy;way.
    <sup>7</sup>&#8239;Oth&shy;er seed fell a&shy;mong thorns. The thorns grew up, and choked it, and it pro&shy;duced no grain.
    <sup>8</sup>&#8239;Oth&shy;er seed fell on good soil. It grew up, in&shy;creased, and pro&shy;duced grain, bring&shy;ing forth thir&shy;ty, six&shy;ty, and a hun&shy;dred&shy;fold.
    <sup>9</sup>&#8239;He who has ears to hear, let him hear.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>4:10</sup>&#8239;When he was a&shy;lone, those a&shy;round him with the twelve asked him a&shy;bout the par&shy;a&shy;bles.
    <sup>14</sup>&#8239;He said to them, <q>The sower sows the word.
    <sup>15</sup>&#8239;These are the ones a&shy;long the path, where the word is sown.  When they hear, im&shy;me&shy;di&shy;ate&shy;ly the temp&shy;ter co&shy;mes, and takes a&shy;way the word sown in them.
    <sup>16</sup>&#8239;These are the ones sown on rock&shy;y ground. When they hear the word, they im&shy;me&shy;di&shy;ate&shy;ly re&shy;ceive it with joy,
    <sup>17</sup>&#8239;but they have no root in them&shy;selves, and en&shy;dure brief&shy;ly.  When trou&shy;ble or per&shy;se&shy;cu&shy;tion co&shy;mes be&shy;cause of the word, they im&shy;me&shy;di&shy;ate&shy;ly fall a&shy;way.
    <sup>18</sup>&#8239;These are the ones sown a&shy;mong thorns. When they hear the word,
    <sup>19</sup>&#8239;the worries of the world, the de&shy;ceit&shy;ful&shy;ness of rich&shy;es, and the de&shy;sire for oth&shy;er things en&shy;ter in and choke the word, and it be&shy;comes un&shy;fruit&shy;ful.
    <sup>20</sup>&#8239;These are the ones sown on good soil. They hear the word, ac&shy;cept it, and bear fruit: thir&shy;ty, six&shy;ty, and a hun&shy;dred&shy;fold.</q>
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

    <sup>4:21</sup>&#8239;He said to them, <q>Is a lamp brought in to be put un&shy;der a bas&shy;ket, or un&shy;der a bed, and not on a stand?

<p>
    <sup>4:24</sup>&#8239;He said to them, <q>Pay at&shy;ten&shy;tion to what you hear. With the meas&shy;ure you use, it will be meas&shy;ured to you, and e&shy;ven more will be added to you.
    <sup>25</sup>&#8239;For who&shy;ev&shy;er has will be giv&shy;en more; and who&shy;ev&shy;er doesn&#x02BC;t have, e&shy;ven what he has will be tak&shy;en a&shy;way.</q>

    <sup>31</sup>&#8239;It&#x02BC;s like a mus&shy;tard seed. When sown up&shy;on the soil, it&#x02BC;s smaller than all oth&shy;er seeds on the ground,
    <sup>32</sup>&#8239;yet when it&#x02BC;s sown, it grows up and be&shy;comes larg&shy;er than all the gar&shy;den plants, and puts out large branches, so the birds of the air can nest in its shade.</q>

<p>
    <sup>4:36</sup>&#8239;Leav&shy;ing the crowd, they took him with them since he was in the boat; and oth&shy;er boats were with him.

</p>

<p>
    <sup>4:38</sup>&#8239;He was in the stern, sleep&shy;ing on the cush&shy;ion. They woke him up, and said to him, <q>Teach&shy;er, don&#x02BC;t you care that we&#x02BC;re go&shy;ing to die?</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>4:39</sup>&#8239;He woke up, re&shy;buked the wind, and said to the sea, <q>Peace. Be still.</q>  The wind stopped, and there was a great calm.

</p>

<p>
    <sup>4:41</sup>&#8239;They were ter&shy;ri&shy;fied, and asked each oth&shy;er, <q>Who is this, that e&shy;ven the wind and the sea o&shy;bey him?</q>

<p>
    <sup>5:1</sup>&#8239;They came to the oth&shy;er side of the sea.
    <sup>2</sup>&#8239;As soon as Jesus got out of the boat, a man with an un&shy;clean spir&shy;it came out of the tombs and met him.
    <sup>3</sup>&#8239;He lived in the tombs. No one could bind him any&shy;more, not e&shy;ven with a chain,
    <sup>4</sup>&#8239;be&shy;cause he had of&shy;ten been bound with shack&shy;les and chains, but had torn the chains a&shy;part, and broke the shack&shy;les in pieces.  No one was strong e&shy;nough to sub&shy;due him.
    <sup>5</sup>&#8239;Night and day, in the tombs and in the moun&shy;tains, he was al&shy;ways cry&shy;ing out, and cut&shy;ting him&shy;self with stones.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>5:6</sup>&#8239;When he saw Jesus from a dis&shy;tance, he ran and knelt down in front of him.
    <sup>7</sup>&#8239;He cried out with a loud voice, <q>What do you want with me, Jesus, you son of the most high God? I beg you by God, not to tor&shy;ment me.</q>
    <sup>8</sup>&#8239;For he had said to him, <q>Come out of the man, you un&shy;clean spir&shy;it.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>5:11</sup>&#8239;There was a large herd of pigs on the hill&shy;side, feed&shy;ing.
    <sup>13</sup>&#8239;So he gave the spir&shy;its per&shy;mis&shy;sion to en&shy;ter the pigs. The un&shy;clean spir&shy;its came out, and en&shy;tered the pigs.  The herd of a&shy;bout two thou&shy;sand rushed down the steep bank in&shy;to the sea and drowned.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>5:14</sup>&#8239;The herdsmen fled and told it in the cit&shy;y and the coun&shy;try&shy;side. Peo&shy;ple came to see what had hap&shy;pened.
    <sup>15</sup>&#8239;They came to Jesus, and saw him who had been pos&shy;sessed with the de&shy;mons, sit&shy;ting, clothed, and in his right mind; and they were a&shy;fraid.
    <sup>16</sup>&#8239;Those who had seen it de&shy;scribed to them what had hap&shy;pened to the de&shy;mon-possessed man and the pigs.
    <sup>17</sup>&#8239;They be&shy;gan to beg Jesus to leave their re&shy;gion.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>5:18</sup>&#8239;As he was entering the boat, the man who had been pos&shy;sessed with de&shy;mons begged to go with him.
    <sup>19</sup>&#8239;He did not let him, but said to him, <q>Go home to your own peo&shy;ple, and tell them how much the Lord has done for you, and how he had mer&shy;cy on you.</q>
    <sup>20</sup>&#8239;He went a&shy;way and be&shy;gan to pro&shy;claim how much Jesus had done for him. Eve&shy;ry&shy;one was a&shy;mazed.

</p>

<p>
    <sup>5:24</sup>&#8239;He went with him.  A large crowd fol&shy;lowed him, and pressed a&shy;round him.

    <sup>26</sup>&#8239;had suf&shy;fered much un&shy;der man&shy;y doc&shy;tors, and had spent all she had, and was no bet&shy;ter, but rath&shy;er grew worse.
    <sup>27</sup>&#8239;Hav&shy;ing heard a&shy;bout Jesus, she came up be&shy;hind him in the crowd, and tou&shy;ched his cloak.
    <sup>28</sup>&#8239;For she said, <q>If I can just tou&shy;ch his clothes, I&#x02BC;ll get well.</q>
    <sup>29</sup>&#8239;Im&shy;me&shy;di&shy;ate&shy;ly, the flow of blood dried up. She felt in her bod&shy;y that she was healed of her af&shy;flic&shy;tion.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>5:30</sup>&#8239;Jesus re&shy;al&shy;ized at once that pow&shy;er had gone out from him, and turned a&shy;round in the crowd, and said, <q>Who tou&shy;ched my clothes?</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>5:31</sup>&#8239;His dis&shy;ci&shy;ples said to him, <q>You see the crowd press&shy;ing a&shy;round you, and yet you ask, <q>Who tou&shy;ched me?</q></q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>5:32</sup>&#8239;He looked a&shy;round to see who had done it.
    <sup>33</sup>&#8239;The wom&shy;an, fearing and trem&shy;bling, know&shy;ing what had hap&shy;pened to her, came and fell down in front of him, and told him the whole truth.
    <sup>34</sup>&#8239;He said to her, <q>Daugh&shy;ter, your faith has made you well.  Go in peace, and be healed of your af&shy;flic&shy;tion.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>5:35</sup>&#8239;While he was still speak&shy;ing, peo&shy;ple came from Jairus&#x02BC;s house and said, <q>Your daugh&shy;ter is dead. Why both&shy;er the teach&shy;er any&shy;more?</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>5:36</sup>&#8239;Jesus o&shy;ver&shy;heard what they said, and told Jairus, <q>Don&#x02BC;t be a&shy;fraid, just be&shy;lieve.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>5:37</sup>&#8239;He al&shy;lowed no one to fol&shy;low him ex&shy;cept Pe&shy;ter, James, and John.
    <sup>38</sup>&#8239;When they came to Jairus&#x02BC;s house, he saw a com&shy;mo&shy;tion, and peo&shy;ple weep&shy;ing and wailing loud&shy;ly.
    <sup>39</sup>&#8239;He went in&shy;side, and asked them, <q>Why are you mak&shy;ing a com&shy;mo&shy;tion, and weep&shy;ing? The child isn&#x02BC;t dead but a&shy;sleep.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>5:40</sup>&#8239;They laughed at him, but he sent them all out&shy;side. He took the child&#x02BC;s fa&shy;ther and moth&shy;er and those who were with him, and went in to where the child was.
    <sup>41</sup>&#8239;Tak&shy;ing her by the hand, he said to her, <q>Lit&shy;tle girl, I say to you, get up.</q>
    <sup>42</sup>&#8239;Im&shy;me&shy;di&shy;ate&shy;ly the girl got up and be&shy;gan walk&shy;ing. They were com&shy;plete&shy;ly a&shy;mazed.
    <sup>43</sup>&#8239;He gave them strict or&shy;ders that no one should know a&shy;bout this, and told them to give her some&shy;thing to eat.
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>6:1</sup>&#8239;He left there, and went to his home&shy;town, and his dis&shy;ci&shy;ples fol&shy;lowed him.
    <sup>2</sup>&#8239;Wh&shy;en the Sabbath came, he be&shy;gan to teach in the syn&shy;a&shy;gogue. Man&shy;y who heard him were a&shy;ston&shy;ished, say&shy;ing, <q>Where did this man get these things? What is this wis&shy;dom giv&shy;en to him?  How are such mir&shy;a&shy;cles done by his hands?
    <sup>3</sup>&#8239;Isn&#x02BC;t this the car&shy;pen&shy;ter, the son of Mar&shy;y, and broth&shy;er of James, and Joses, and Ju&shy;das, and Simon?  Aren&#x02BC;t his sis&shy;ters here with us?</q>  And they took of&shy;fense at him.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>6:4</sup>&#8239;Jesus said to them, <q>A proph&shy;et is with&shy;out hon&shy;or on&shy;ly in his home&shy;town, am&shy;ong his rel&shy;a&shy;tives, and in his own house&shy;hold.</q>
    <sup>5</sup>&#8239;He could do no mir&shy;a&shy;cle there, ex&shy;cept to lay his hands on a few sick peo&shy;ple, and heal them.

    <sup>9</sup>&#8239;but to wear san&shy;dals and not a sec&shy;ond shirt.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>6:12</sup>&#8239;They went out, and preached that peo&shy;ple should re&shy;pent.

    <sup>17</sup>&#8239;For Her&shy;od had mar&shy;ried Herodias, his broth&shy;er&#x02BC;s wife. He had or&shy;dered John to be ar&shy;rested and bound in pris&shy;on for her sa&shy;ke.
    <sup>18</sup>&#8239;For John had been tell&shy;ing Her&shy;od, <q>It&#x02BC;s not law&shy;ful for you to have your broth&shy;er&#x02BC;s wife.</q>
    <sup>19</sup>&#8239;So Herodias had a grudge a&shy;gainst him, and wanted to kill him. But she could not,
    <sup>20</sup>&#8239;be&shy;cause Her&shy;od feared John, and kept him safe, know&shy;ing that he was a right&shy;eous and ho&shy;ly man. When he heard him, he was great&shy;ly per&shy;plexed, yet he en&shy;joyed listening to him.

</p>

<p>

    <sup>12:1</sup>&#8239;He be&shy;gan to speak to them in par&shy;a&shy;bles. <q>A man planted a vine&shy;yard, put a fence a&shy;round it, dug a pit for a wine&shy;press, and built a tow&shy;er. Then he leased it to ten&shy;ants, and went on a jour&shy;ney.
    <sup>2</sup>&#8239;At har&shy;vest time, he sent a serv&shy;ant to the ten&shy;ants to col&shy;lect some of the fruit of the vine&shy;yard from them.
    <sup>3</sup>&#8239;They took him, beat him, and sent him a&shy;way emp&shy;ty-handed.
    <sup>4</sup>&#8239;A&shy;gain he sent them an&shy;oth&shy;er serv&shy;ant. They hit him on the head, and treated him shamefully.
    <sup>5</sup>&#8239;He sent an&shy;oth&shy;er, and they killed that one. He sent man&shy;y oth&shy;ers; they beat some, and killed oth&shy;ers.
    <sup>6</sup>&#8239;He had one more to send, a be&shy;lov&shy;ed son. Fi&shy;nal&shy;ly he sent him to them, say&shy;ing, <q>They will re&shy;spect my son.</q></q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>12:7</sup>&#8239;<q>But those ten&shy;ants said to one an&shy;oth&shy;er, <q>This is the heir. Come, let&#x02BC;s kill him, and the in&shy;her&shy;it&shy;ance will be ours.</q>
    <sup>8</sup>&#8239;They took him, killed him, and threw him out of the vine&shy;yard.</q>

</p>

<p>
    <sup>12:12</sup>&#8239;They were seek&shy;ing to ar&shy;rest him, be&shy;cause they un&shy;der&shy;stood that he spoke the par&shy;a&shy;ble a&shy;gainst them, but they feared the crowd. So they left him, and went a&shy;way.

    <sup>12:13</sup>&#8239;They sent some of the Pharisees and Herodians to him, so that they might trap him in his words.

You don&#x02BC;t care what any&shy;one thinks, be&shy;cause you&#x02BC;re im&shy;par&shy;tial. You truthfully teach the way of God. Is it law&shy;ful to pay taxes to Caesar, or not?</q>
    <sup>15</sup>&#8239;Know&shy;ing their hy&shy;poc&shy;ri&shy;sy, he said to them, <q>Why are you testing me? Bring me a de&shy;nar&shy;i&shy;us to look at.</q>

    <sup>12:18</sup>&#8239;Some Sadducees, who say there is no res&shy;ur&shy;rec&shy;tion, came to Jesus and asked him,
    <sup>19</sup>&#8239;<q>Teach&shy;er, Mo&shy;ses wrote for us that if a man&#x02BC;s broth&shy;er dies, and leaves be&shy;hind a wife but no child, that his broth&shy;er must mar&shy;ry the wid&shy;ow, and raise up chil&shy;dren for his broth&shy;er.
    <sup>20</sup>&#8239;There were sev&shy;en broth&shy;ers. The first one took a wife, and died with&shy;out chil&shy;dren.

    <sup>22</sup>&#8239;None of the sev&shy;en left chil&shy;dren. Last of all, the wom&shy;an died too.
    <sup>23</sup>&#8239;In the res&shy;ur&shy;rec&shy;tion, when they rise, whose wife will she be? For all sev&shy;en had mar&shy;ried her.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>12:24</sup>&#8239;Jesus said to them, <q>Isn&#x02BC;t this the rea&shy;son you are mis&shy;tak&shy;en: you don&#x02BC;t know the scrip&shy;tures or the pow&shy;er of God?
    <sup>25</sup>&#8239;For when the dead rise, they nei&shy;ther mar&shy;ry nor are giv&shy;en in mar&shy;riage, but are like an&shy;gels in heav&shy;en.</q>

<p>
    <sup>12:26</sup>&#8239;<q>As for the dead be&shy;ing raised, have&shy;n&#x02BC;t you read in the book of Mo&shy;ses, in the pas&shy;sage a&shy;bout the burn&shy;ing bush, how God said to him, <q>I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob</q>?
    <sup>27</sup>&#8239;He isn&#x02BC;t God of the dead, but of the liv&shy;ing. You&#x02BC;re great&shy;ly mis&shy;tak&shy;en.</q>

<p>
    <sup>12:28</sup>&#8239;One of the scr&shy;ibes came, and heard them ar&shy;gu&shy;ing. See&shy;ing that he an&shy;swered them well, he asked him, <q>Which com&shy;mand&shy;ment is the most im&shy;por&shy;tant?</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>12:29</sup>&#8239;Jesus an&shy;swered, <q>The most im&shy;por&shy;tant is,
    <sup>30</sup>&#8239;<q>Love the Lord your God with all your heart, soul, mind, and strength.</q>
    <sup>31</sup>&#8239;The sec&shy;ond is this, <q>Love your neigh&shy;bor as your&shy;self.</q> There is no com&shy;mand&shy;ment greater than these.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>12:32</sup>&#8239;The scr&shy;ibe said to him, <q>You stat&shy;ed cor&shy;rect&shy;ly that
    <sup>33</sup>&#8239;to love him with all the heart, un&shy;der&shy;stand&shy;ing, and strength, and to love one&#x02BC;s neigh&shy;bor as him&shy;self, is more im&shy;por&shy;tant than all burnt of&shy;fer&shy;ings and sac&shy;ri&shy;fices.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>12:34</sup>&#8239;When Jesus saw that he an&shy;swered wisely, he said to him, <q>You aren&#x02BC;t far from God&#x02BC;s king&shy;dom.</q> Af&shy;ter that, no one dared to ask him any more ques&shy;tions.

</p>

<p>
    <sup>13:2</sup>&#8239;Jesus said to him, <q>Do you see these great build&shy;ings? Not one stone will be left up&shy;on an&shy;oth&shy;er; all will be thrown down.</q>

<p>
    <sup>13:3</sup>&#8239;As he sat on the Mount of Ol&shy;ives op&shy;po&shy;site the tem&shy;ple, Pe&shy;ter, James, John and Andrew asked him pri&shy;vate&shy;ly,

</p>

<p>
    <sup>13:5</sup>&#8239;Jesus said to them, <q>See that no one leads you a&shy;stray.

</p>

<p>
    <sup>13:34</sup>&#8239;<q>It&#x02BC;s like a man on a jour&shy;ney: when he leaves home, he puts his serv&shy;ants in charge, each with a task, and com&shy;mands the door&shy;keep&shy;er to be a&shy;lert.

    <sup>14:1</sup>&#8239;The Passover and the Feast of Un&shy;leav&shy;ened Bread were now two days a&shy;way. The chief priests and the scr&shy;ibes sought a way to ar&shy;rest him by stealth, and kill him.

<p>
    <sup>14:6</sup>&#8239;Jesus said, <q>Leave her a&shy;lone. Why are you bothering her? She&#x02BC;s done a beau&shy;ti&shy;ful thing for me.
    <sup>7</sup>&#8239;You al&shy;ways have the poor with you. When&shy;ev&shy;er you want, you can do good for them, but you won&#x02BC;t al&shy;ways have me.

</p>

<p>
    <sup>14:13</sup>&#8239;He sent two of his dis&shy;ci&shy;ples, and told them, <q>Go in&shy;to the cit&shy;y. A man car&shy;ry&shy;ing a pitch&shy;er of wa&shy;ter will meet you. Fol&shy;low him.

<p>
    <sup>14:22</sup>&#8239;As they were eat&shy;ing, he took bread, bless&shy;ed it, broke it, gave it to them, and said, <q>Take it. This is my bod&shy;y.</q>

<p>
    <sup>14:62</sup>&#8239;Jesus said, <q>I am. You&#x02BC;ll see the son of man sit&shy;ting at the right hand of pow&shy;er, and com&shy;ing with the clouds of heav&shy;en.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>14:63</sup>&#8239;The high priest tore his clothes, and said, <q>Why do we need any more witnesses?
    <sup>64</sup>&#8239;You&#x02BC;ve heard the blas&shy;phe&shy;my. What&#x02BC;s your de&shy;ci&shy;sion?</q> They all con&shy;demned him as de&shy;serv&shy;ing death.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>14:65</sup>&#8239;Some be&shy;gan to spit on him, and to cov&shy;er his face and strike him, say&shy;ing, <q>Proph&shy;e&shy;sy.</q> The guards re&shy;ceived him with slaps in the face.
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>14:66</sup>&#8239;While Pe&shy;ter was in the court&shy;yard be&shy;low, one of the high priest&#x02BC;s serv&shy;ant girls came.
    <sup>67</sup>&#8239;See&shy;ing Pe&shy;ter, she looked at him, and said, <q>You al&shy;so were with Jesus the Nazarene.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>14:68</sup>&#8239;But he de&shy;nied it, say&shy;ing, <q>I don&#x02BC;t know or un&shy;der&shy;stand what you&#x02BC;re talking a&shy;bout.</q> He went out to the en&shy;try&shy;way, and a roost&shy;er crowed.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>14:69</sup>&#8239;The serv&shy;ant girl saw him, and be&shy;gan a&shy;gain to tell the by&shy;stand&shy;ers, <q>This man is one of them.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>14:70</sup>&#8239;But a&shy;gain he de&shy;nied it. Af&shy;ter a lit&shy;tle while the by&shy;stand&shy;ers a&shy;gain said to Pe&shy;ter, <q>You&#x02BC;re cer&shy;tain&shy;ly one of them, since you&#x02BC;re a Galilean too.</q>
    <sup>71</sup>&#8239;But he be&shy;gan to curse and swear, <q>I don&#x02BC;t know this man you&#x02BC;re talking a&shy;bout.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>14:72</sup>&#8239;Im&shy;me&shy;di&shy;ate&shy;ly a roost&shy;er crowed a sec&shy;ond time. Pe&shy;ter re&shy;mem&shy;bered when Jesus said to him, <q>Be&shy;fore a roost&shy;er crows twice, you&#x02BC;ll de&shy;ny me three times</q>. He be&shy;gan to weep.
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>15:1</sup>&#8239;Ear&shy;ly in the morn&shy;ing, the chief priests, el&shy;ders, scr&shy;ibes, and the whole coun&shy;cil held a con&shy;sul&shy;ta&shy;tion. They bound Jesus, led him a&shy;way, and de&shy;liv&shy;ered him to Pilate.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>15:2</sup>&#8239;Pilate asked him, <q>Are you the king of the Jews?</q> He an&shy;swered, <q>You have said so.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>15:3</sup>&#8239;The chief priests ac&shy;cused him of man&shy;y things.
    <sup>4</sup>&#8239;Pilate a&shy;gain asked him, <q>Don&#x02BC;t you an&shy;swer? Look how man&shy;y char&shy;ges they bring a&shy;gainst you.</q>
    <sup>5</sup>&#8239;But Jesus an&shy;swered no fur&shy;ther, so Pilate was a&shy;mazed.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>15:6</sup>&#8239;Now at the feast he used to re&shy;lease for them any one pris&shy;on&shy;er whom they re&shy;quested.
    <sup>7</sup>&#8239;The man named Barabbas was in pris&shy;on with re&shy;bels who had com&shy;mit&shy;ted mur&shy;der dur&shy;ing the in&shy;sur&shy;rec&shy;tion.
    <sup>8</sup>&#8239;The crowd be&shy;gan to ask Pilate to do for them as he u&shy;su&shy;al&shy;ly did.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>15:9</sup>&#8239;Pilate an&shy;swered them, say&shy;ing, <q>Do you want me to re&shy;lease the king of the Jews for you?</q>
    <sup>10</sup>&#8239;For he knew that the chief priests had hand&shy;ed him o&shy;ver be&shy;cause of en&shy;vy.
    <sup>11</sup>&#8239;But the chief priests stirred up the crowd to have him re&shy;lease Barabbas in&shy;stead.
    <sup>12</sup>&#8239;Pilate a&shy;gain asked them, <q>Then what should I do with the one you call the king of the Jews?</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>15:13</sup>&#8239;They shouted back, <q>Cru&shy;ci&shy;fy him!</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>15:14</sup>&#8239;Pilate asked them, <q>Why? What evil has he done?</q> But they shouted all the more, <q>Cru&shy;ci&shy;fy him!</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>15:15</sup>&#8239;Wishing to sat&shy;is&shy;fy the crowd, Pilate re&shy;leased Barabbas for them. Af&shy;ter hav&shy;ing Jesus flogged, he hand&shy;ed him o&shy;ver to be cru&shy;ci&shy;fied.
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>15:21</sup>&#8239;Simon of Cyrene was pass&shy;ing by, com&shy;ing from the coun&shy;try. They forced him to car&shy;ry Jesus&#x02BC;s cross.
    <sup>22</sup>&#8239;They brought Jesus to the place called Gol&shy;go&shy;tha, which means place of a skull.
    <sup>23</sup>&#8239;They of&shy;fered him wine mixed with myrrh, but he did not take it.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>15:24</sup>&#8239;They cru&shy;ci&shy;fied him, and di&shy;vid&shy;ed his clothes a&shy;mong them&shy;selves, cast&shy;ing lots to de&shy;cide what each should take.
    <sup>25</sup>&#8239;It was nine in the morn&shy;ing when they cru&shy;ci&shy;fied him.
    <sup>26</sup>&#8239;The in&shy;scrip&shy;tion of the charge a&shy;gainst him read, <q>The King of the Jews.</q>
    <sup>27</sup>&#8239;They cru&shy;ci&shy;fied two rob&shy;bers with him, one on his right and one on his left.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>15:29</sup>&#8239;Those who passed by de&shy;rid&shy;ed him, shak&shy;ing their heads, and say&shy;ing, <q>Ha! You who would de&shy;stroy the tem&shy;ple and re&shy;build it in three days,
    <sup>30</sup>&#8239;save your&shy;self, and come down from the cross.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>15:31</sup>&#8239;In the same way, the chief priests and the scr&shy;ibes mocked him to one an&shy;oth&shy;er say&shy;ing, <q>He saved oth&shy;ers. He can&#x02BC;t save him&shy;self.
    <sup>32</sup>&#8239;Let this Christ, the King of Israel, come down now from the cross, so that we may see and be&shy;lieve.</q> Those who were cru&shy;ci&shy;fied with him al&shy;so in&shy;sulted him.
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>15:33</sup>&#8239;At noon, dark&shy;ness fell o&shy;ver the whole land un&shy;til three in the af&shy;ter&shy;noon.
    <sup>34</sup>&#8239;At three in the af&shy;ter&shy;noon Jesus cried with a loud voice, <q>My God, my God, why have you a&shy;ban&shy;doned me?</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>15:37</sup>&#8239;Jesus let out a loud cry, and br&shy;ea&shy;thed his last.
    <sup>38</sup>&#8239;The cur&shy;tain of the tem&shy;ple was torn in two, from the top to the bot&shy;tom.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>15:39</sup>&#8239;When the cen&shy;tu&shy;ri&shy;on who stood fac&shy;ing him saw the way he breathed his last, he said, <q>Tru&shy;ly this man was the son of God.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>15:40</sup>&#8239;There were al&shy;so wom&shy;en watching from a dis&shy;tance. A&shy;mong them were Mar&shy;y Mag&shy;da&shy;lene, Salome, and Mar&shy;y the moth&shy;er of James the young&shy;er and of Joses.
    <sup>41</sup>&#8239;Wh&shy;en he was in Gal&shy;i&shy;lee, they fol&shy;lowed him and took care of him. Man&shy;y oth&shy;er wom&shy;en had come up with him to Je&shy;ru&shy;sa&shy;lem.
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>15:42</sup>&#8239;When eve&shy;ning had come, be&shy;cause it was the day be&shy;fore the Sabbath,
    <sup>43</sup>&#8239;Jo&shy;seph of Arimathea came, a prom&shy;i&shy;nent mem&shy;ber of the coun&shy;cil, who was him&shy;self waiting for God&#x02BC;s king&shy;dom. He bold&shy;ly went to Pilate, and asked for Jesus&#x02BC;s bod&shy;y.
    <sup>44</sup>&#8239;Pilate was sur&shy;prised that he was al&shy;read&shy;y dead.
    <sup>45</sup>&#8239;He grant&shy;ed the bod&shy;y to Jo&shy;seph.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>15:46</sup>&#8239;Jo&shy;seph bought a lin&shy;en cloth, took him down, wrapped him in the lin&shy;en cloth, laid him in a tomb cut out of a rock, and rolled a stone a&shy;gainst the en&shy;trance of the tomb.
    <sup>47</sup>&#8239;Mar&shy;y Mag&shy;da&shy;lene and Mar&shy;y the moth&shy;er of Joses were watching to see where he was laid.
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>16:1</sup>&#8239;When the Sabbath was past, Mar&shy;y Mag&shy;da&shy;lene, Salome, and Mar&shy;y the moth&shy;er of James bought spices, so that they could go and a&shy;noint him.
    <sup>2</sup>&#8239;Ver&shy;y ear&shy;ly on the first day of the week, when the sun had ris&shy;en, they went to the tomb.
    <sup>3</sup>&#8239;They were say&shy;ing to one an&shy;oth&shy;er, <q>Who will roll a&shy;way the stone from the en&shy;trance of the tomb for us?</q>
    <sup>4</sup>&#8239;Looking up, they saw that the stone had al&shy;read&shy;y been rolled a&shy;way, al&shy;though it was ex&shy;treme&shy;ly large.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>16:5</sup>&#8239;Entering the tomb, they saw a you&shy;ng man sit&shy;ting at the right, wear&shy;ing a white robe, and they were a&shy;larmed.
    <sup>6</sup>&#8239;He told them, <q>Don&#x02BC;t be a&shy;larmed. You&#x02BC;re looking for Jesus the Nazarene, who was cru&shy;ci&shy;fied. He has ris&shy;en. He&#x02BC;s not here. See, here is the place where they laid him.
    <sup>7</sup>&#8239;But go, tell his dis&shy;ci&shy;ples and Pe&shy;ter, <q>He&#x02BC;s go&shy;ing a&shy;head of you to Gal&shy;i&shy;lee. You&#x02BC;ll see him there, just as he told you.</q></q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>16:8</sup>&#8239;They went out, and fled from the tomb, for trem&shy;bling and as&shy;ton&shy;ish&shy;ment had seized them.  They said noth&shy;ing to any&shy;one, be&shy;cause they were a&shy;fraid.
