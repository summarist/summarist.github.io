<h2 id="introduction" class="section">Introduction</h2>

<p>
    <sup>1</sup>&#8239;God loves eve&shy;ry&shy;one and wants each of us to find joy and sat&shy;is&shy;fac&shy;tion.
    <sup>2</sup>&#8239;To help us to&shy;wards that goal, God gave us rea&shy;son, con&shy;science, and the a&shy;bil&shy;i&shy;ty to choose.
    <sup>3</sup>&#8239;Our re&shy;spon&shy;si&shy;bil&shy;i&shy;ty is to fol&shy;low, sin&shy;cere&shy;ly, the dic&shy;tates of our con&shy;science, while re&shy;spect&shy;ing the e&shy;qual priv&shy;i&shy;lege of oth&shy;ers to do the same.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>4</sup>&#8239;We&#x02BC;re ac&shy;count&shy;a&shy;ble to God for our choices.
    <sup>5</sup>&#8239;Each of us can have a per&shy;son&shy;al re&shy;la&shy;tion&shy;ship with God.
    <sup>6</sup>&#8239;God com&shy;mu&shy;ni&shy;cates with each of us as needed,
    <sup>7</sup>&#8239;and sends mes&shy;sen&shy;gers to dif&shy;fer&shy;ent times, places, and cul&shy;tures to guide us.  Stud&shy;y&shy;ing the mes&shy;sages that are in&shy;tend&shy;ed for us can en&shy;light&shy;en our un&shy;der&shy;stand&shy;ing.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>8</sup>&#8239;God knows the vast&shy;ness of hu&shy;man di&shy;ver&shy;si&shy;ty.  Just as a skilled op&shy;tom&shy;e&shy;trist pre&shy;scribes eye&shy;glass&shy;es to com&shy;pen&shy;sate for a pa&shy;tient&#x02BC;s short&shy;com&shy;ings, God guides us to a pre&shy;scrip&shy;tion that&#x02BC;s op&shy;ti&shy;mized for our spir&shy;it&shy;u&shy;al growth.  Our pre&shy;scrip&shy;tion may dif&shy;fer from, or co&shy;in&shy;cide with, that of our peers.
    <sup>9</sup>&#8239;Be&shy;cause of this di&shy;ver&shy;si&shy;ty, a com&shy;mu&shy;ni&shy;ty of be&shy;liev&shy;ers can strength&shy;en and in&shy;spire one an&shy;oth&shy;er.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>10</sup>&#8239;De&shy;tails a&shy;bout God&#x02BC;s na&shy;ture and meth&shy;ods are large&shy;ly a dis&shy;trac&shy;tion from the prop&shy;er fo&shy;cus of our lives: a life&shy;long mi&shy;gra&shy;tion to&shy;wards joy through our per&shy;son&shy;al choices.
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>11</sup>&#8239;While striving to live the prin&shy;ci&shy;ples de&shy;scribed a&shy;bove, I felt guid&shy;ed to prayer&shy;ful&shy;ly un&shy;der&shy;take the ac&shy;tions be&shy;low.  The re&shy;sults are for my own ben&shy;e&shy;fit and may not ben&shy;e&shy;fit oth&shy;ers in the same way.
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>12</sup>&#8239;Cre&shy;ate a prioritized list of es&shy;sen&shy;tial com&shy;mand&shy;ments to help me fo&shy;cus on what mat&shy;ters most and to re&shy;solve con&shy;flicts that may a&shy;rise be&shy;tween those com&shy;mand&shy;ments.  This be&shy;came the Di&shy;gest of Priorities.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>13</sup>&#8239;Write pairs of es&shy;sen&shy;tial vir&shy;tues whose opposing de&shy;mands I need to bal&shy;ance in my own life.  This be&shy;came the Di&shy;gest of Vir&shy;tues.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>14</sup>&#8239;Try dif&shy;fer&shy;ent meth&shy;ods of pray&shy;er, listening care&shy;ful&shy;ly to un&shy;der&shy;stand which are most ef&shy;fec&shy;tive at strengthening my re&shy;la&shy;tion&shy;ship with God.  Cod&shy;i&shy;fy those prac&shy;tices and ob&shy;serve them faith&shy;ful&shy;ly. This be&shy;came the Di&shy;gest of Pray&shy;er.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>15</sup>&#8239;Rec&shy;ord short i&shy;de&shy;as that God has used to clar&shy;i&shy;fy my un&shy;der&shy;stand&shy;ing of cer&shy;tain prin&shy;ci&shy;ples.  This be&shy;came the Di&shy;gest of Max&shy;ims.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>16</sup>&#8239;Stud&shy;y the mes&shy;sages of those who are wide&shy;ly con&shy;sid&shy;ered to be proph&shy;ets of God.  A&shy;bridge those mes&shy;sages by selecting the teach&shy;ings that are the most prac&shy;ti&shy;cal and im&shy;por&shy;tant for guid&shy;ing my life.  This be&shy;came the Mes&shy;sages.  I re&shy;fer to them as The Mes&shy;sage of Mo&shy;ses, The Mes&shy;sage of Jesus, etc.
</p>


<h2 id="digests" class="section">Digests</h2>


<h2 id="priorities">Priorities</h2>
<p>
    <sup>1</sup>&#8239;You have rea&shy;son and con&shy;science to gov&shy;ern your choices.

    <sup>3</sup>&#8239;They are list&shy;ed by de&shy;creas&shy;ing im&shy;por&shy;tance.
    <sup>4</sup>&#8239;Try to ob&shy;serve all the priorities.
    <sup>5</sup>&#8239;If two must con&shy;flict, pre&shy;fer the more im&shy;por&shy;tant one.

    <sup>6</sup>&#8239;Com&shy;pul&shy;sion may on&shy;ly be used to stop an im&shy;me&shy;di&shy;ate threat to life, prop&shy;er&shy;ty, or free will.
    <sup>7</sup>&#8239;Choose what you will have at the ex&shy;pense of what you won&#x02BC;t.

    <sup>34</sup>&#8239;Make an hon&shy;est prof&shy;it.
    <sup>35</sup>&#8239;In&shy;cur debts rare&shy;ly and spar&shy;ing&shy;ly, and pay them back quick&shy;ly.
    <sup>36</sup>&#8239;Ten per&shy;cent of your an&shy;nu&shy;al ex&shy;pend&shy;i&shy;tures should be do&shy;na&shy;tions.

What is the use of scolding Zai Yu?  I used to lis&shy;ten to what peo&shy;ple said and trust them to act ac&shy;cord&shy;ing&shy;ly.

<p>
    <sup>5:16</sup>&#8239;Zi Chan had four char&shy;ac&shy;ter&shy;is&shy;tics of the Way of a su&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;or man: he was re&shy;spect&shy;ful in his pri&shy;vate con&shy;duct, re&shy;spect&shy;ful in serv&shy;ing his su&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;ors, gen&shy;er&shy;ous in car&shy;ing for the peo&shy;ple, and just in employing the peo&shy;ple.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>5:17</sup>&#8239;Yang Ping Zhong ex&shy;celled in his re&shy;la&shy;tions with oth&shy;ers.  E&shy;ven af&shy;ter long ac&shy;quaint&shy;ance he con&shy;tin&shy;ued to treat them with re&shy;spect.

</p>

<p>
    <sup>5:23</sup>&#8239;Bo Yi and Shu Qi did not re&shy;mem&shy;ber old griev&shy;ances, so there was lit&shy;tle re&shy;sent&shy;ment a&shy;gainst them.

<p>

<p>
    <sup>5:26</sup>&#8239;My heart&#x02BC;s de&shy;sire is to bring peace to the old, to share trust with my friends, and to cher&shy;ish the young.

    <sup>6:3</sup>&#8239;Yanhui loved learn&shy;ing. He nev&shy;er took his an&shy;ger out on oth&shy;ers, and nev&shy;er made the same mis&shy;take twice.
    <sup>11</sup>&#8239;How ad&shy;mi&shy;ra&shy;ble he was! He lived on a bowlful of rice to eat, a la&shy;dle&shy;ful of wa&shy;ter to drink, and a hov&shy;el for shel&shy;ter. Oth&shy;ers could not have en&shy;dured such mis&shy;er&shy;y, yet Yanhui&#x02BC;s joy was un&shy;changed.

    <sup>6:15</sup>&#8239;Meng Zhifan was not boast&shy;ful.  He once held the rear dur&shy;ing a re&shy;treat.  As they reached the cit&shy;y gate, he whipped his horse, say&shy;ing, <q>It&#x02BC;s not that I dared to be last, on&shy;ly that my horse wouldn&#x02BC;t go.</q>

    <sup>6:18</sup>&#8239;When nat&shy;u&shy;ral dis&shy;po&shy;si&shy;tion pre&shy;vails o&shy;ver re&shy;fine&shy;ment, you get a sav&shy;age.  When re&shy;fine&shy;ment pre&shy;vails o&shy;ver nat&shy;u&shy;ral dis&shy;po&shy;si&shy;tion, you get a pe&shy;dan&shy;tic clerk.  When nat&shy;u&shy;ral dis&shy;po&shy;si&shy;tion and re&shy;fine&shy;ment are prop&shy;er&shy;ly blend&shy;ed, you get a su&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;or man.

<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>7:2</sup>&#8239;It&#x02BC;s nat&shy;u&shy;ral for me to store up knowl&shy;edge si&shy;lent&shy;ly, to learn with&shy;out sa&shy;ti&shy;e&shy;ty, and to teach oth&shy;ers with&shy;out wea&shy;ri&shy;ness.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>7:3</sup>&#8239;My worries are fail&shy;ure to cul&shy;ti&shy;vate vir&shy;tue, fail&shy;ure to ex&shy;plore what I learn, in&shy;a&shy;bil&shy;i&shy;ty to fol&shy;low what is right when I hear it, and in&shy;a&shy;bil&shy;i&shy;ty to change what is not good.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>7:6</sup>&#8239;Set your heart on the Way. Base your&shy;self in vir&shy;tue. Re&shy;ly on be&shy;nev&shy;o&shy;lence. En&shy;joy the arts.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>7:7</sup>&#8239;I have nev&shy;er de&shy;nied in&shy;struc&shy;tion to any&shy;one, e&shy;ven if his own re&shy;sources could on&shy;ly af&shy;ford a bun&shy;dle of dried meat for tu&shy;i&shy;tion.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>7:8</sup>&#8239;I on&shy;ly en&shy;light&shy;en those who are driv&shy;en by ea&shy;ger&shy;ness to learn and who are anx&shy;ious&shy;ly try&shy;ing to ex&shy;plain their i&shy;de&shy;as.  If I lift up one cor&shy;ner and they can&shy;not come back with the oth&shy;er three, I don&#x02BC;t re&shy;peat my&shy;self.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>7:9</sup>&#8239;When Con&shy;fu&shy;cius was eat&shy;ing in the pres&shy;ence of a mourn&shy;er, he nev&shy;er ate his fill.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>7:11</sup>&#8239;Few have the a&shy;bil&shy;i&shy;ty to act when em&shy;ployed and to hide when dis&shy;missed. If I were com&shy;mand&shy;ing the Three Armies, who would I take with me? A man who would wres&shy;tle a ti&shy;ger with bare hands or cross a riv&shy;er on foot, dy&shy;ing with&shy;out re&shy;gret&mdash;I would not take that man.  It must be some&shy;one who approaches a task with ap&shy;pre&shy;hen&shy;sion, likes to make plans, and can ex&shy;e&shy;cute them suc&shy;cess&shy;ful&shy;ly.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>7:12</sup>&#8239;If wealth can be sought de&shy;cent&shy;ly, I will do so, e&shy;ven if I have to have a low&shy;ly job. If it can&shy;not be sought de&shy;cent&shy;ly, I will fol&shy;low what I love.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>7:15</sup>&#8239;Bo Yi and Shu Qi sought be&shy;nev&shy;o&shy;lence and got it. Why should they have com&shy;plaints?
</p>

<p>
    <sup>7:16</sup>&#8239;Coarse rice to eat, wa&shy;ter to drink, and your bent arm for a pil&shy;low&mdash;there is still joy in the midst of these things.  Wealth and hon&shy;or ob&shy;tained by un&shy;right&shy;eous means are like fleet&shy;ing clouds to me.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>7:17</sup>&#8239;Give me a few more years; if I can stud&shy;y un&shy;til fif&shy;ty, I may be free from great mis&shy;takes.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>7:19</sup>&#8239;I&#x02BC;m the kind of man who is so ea&shy;ger for knowl&shy;edge that he for&shy;gets to eat, who is so joy&shy;ful that he for&shy;gets to wor&shy;ry, and who is not a&shy;ware that old age is com&shy;ing.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>7:20</sup>&#8239;I was not born with knowl&shy;edge, but I love an&shy;tiq&shy;ui&shy;ty and ear&shy;nest&shy;ly seek it.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>7:22</sup>&#8239;When walk&shy;ing with any two peo&shy;ple, they must have some&shy;thing to teach me. I se&shy;lect their strengths and fol&shy;low them, their weaknesses and cor&shy;rect my&shy;self.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>7:23</sup>&#8239;Heav&shy;en gave birth to the vir&shy;tue in me. What can an&shy;gry rul&shy;ers do to me?
</p>

<p>
    <sup>7:24</sup>&#8239;My friends, I hide noth&shy;ing from you.  What&shy;ev&shy;er I do, I share with you. That is who I am.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>7:26</sup>&#8239;I can&#x02BC;t hope to meet a sage, but I would be con&shy;tent to meet a su&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;or man.  I can&#x02BC;t hope to meet a tru&shy;ly good man, but I would be con&shy;tent to meet a stead&shy;fast man.  It is hard to be stead&shy;fast when noth&shy;ing pre&shy;tends to be some&shy;thing, emp&shy;ti&shy;ness pre&shy;tends to be full&shy;ness, and pov&shy;er&shy;ty pre&shy;tends to be com&shy;fort.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>7:27</sup>&#8239;Con&shy;fu&shy;cius fished with a line, but didn&#x02BC;t use a net.  He hunt&shy;ed, but didn&#x02BC;t shoot roosting birds.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>7:28</sup>&#8239;There may be those who can act with&shy;out knowl&shy;edge, but I am not one of them.  I hear much, se&shy;lect what is good, and fol&shy;low it.  I see much, and re&shy;mem&shy;ber it.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>7:29</sup>&#8239;To ap&shy;prove of a man&#x02BC;s vis&shy;it doesn&#x02BC;t mean ap&shy;prov&shy;ing of what he does af&shy;ter he leaves. When a man purifies him&shy;self to ap&shy;proach me, I ap&shy;prove of his pu&shy;ri&shy;ty with&shy;out en&shy;dors&shy;ing his past or his fu&shy;ture.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>7:30</sup>&#8239;Is be&shy;nev&shy;o&shy;lence far a&shy;way? As soon as I want be&shy;nev&shy;o&shy;lence, it is at hand.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>7:31</sup>&#8239;I&#x02BC;m for&shy;tu&shy;nate. When I make a mis&shy;take, oth&shy;ers al&shy;ways no&shy;tice it.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>7:34</sup>&#8239;How would I dare claim to be be&shy;nev&shy;o&shy;lent or a sage?  Rath&shy;er, it may be said that I strive for them with&shy;out flag&shy;ging, and teach oth&shy;ers with&shy;out wea&shy;ri&shy;ness.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>7:36</sup>&#8239;Ex&shy;trav&shy;a&shy;gance leads to ar&shy;ro&shy;gance; fru&shy;gal&shy;i&shy;ty leads to stin&shy;gi&shy;ness. It&#x02BC;s bet&shy;ter to be sting&shy;y than ar&shy;ro&shy;gant.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>7:37</sup>&#8239;A su&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;or man is eas&shy;y&shy;go&shy;ing and un&shy;per&shy;turbed. An in&shy;fe&shy;ri&shy;or man is al&shy;ways tense and anx&shy;ious.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>7:38</sup>&#8239;Con&shy;fu&shy;cius was warm yet stern; au&shy;thor&shy;i&shy;ta&shy;tive but not fierce; re&shy;spect&shy;ful yet at ease.
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>8:1</sup>&#8239;Tai Bo can be said to have had the highest vir&shy;tue.  Three times he de&shy;clined his claim to the king&shy;dom.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>8:2</sup>&#8239;Cour&shy;te&shy;sy with&shy;out pro&shy;pri&shy;e&shy;ty is tire&shy;some.  Cau&shy;tion with&shy;out pro&shy;pri&shy;e&shy;ty is ti&shy;mid&shy;i&shy;ty.  Brav&shy;er&shy;y with&shy;out pro&shy;pri&shy;e&shy;ty is cha&shy;os.  Can&shy;dor with&shy;out pro&shy;pri&shy;e&shy;ty is rude&shy;ness.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>8:9</sup>&#8239;The peo&shy;ple can be made to fol&shy;low a path, but they can&#x02BC;t be made to un&shy;der&shy;stand it.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>8:10</sup>&#8239;A man who loves brav&shy;er&shy;y and hates pov&shy;er&shy;ty will pro&shy;ceed to un&shy;ru&shy;ly be&shy;hav&shy;ior.  A man with&shy;out be&shy;nev&shy;o&shy;lence who is de&shy;spised by oth&shy;ers too much will pro&shy;ceed to un&shy;ru&shy;ly be&shy;hav&shy;ior.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>8:11</sup>&#8239;If a man had tal&shy;ents as ad&shy;mi&shy;ra&shy;ble as the Duke of Zhou, but was ar&shy;ro&shy;gant and sting&shy;y, the rest would not be worth no&shy;tic&shy;ing.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>8:13</sup>&#8239;Have sin&shy;cere faith, love learn&shy;ing, and de&shy;fend the good Way un&shy;to death.  Don&#x02BC;t en&shy;ter a state that is in per&shy;il, and don&#x02BC;t stay in one that is in cha&shy;os.  Show your&shy;self when the Way pre&shy;vails in the world, but hide when it does not.  When the Way pre&shy;vails in the state, it is shame&shy;ful to be poor and hum&shy;ble. When the Way does not pre&shy;vail in the state, it is shame&shy;ful to be rich and no&shy;ble.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>8:14</sup>&#8239;Don&#x02BC;t plan the policies of a po&shy;si&shy;tion that you don&#x02BC;t hold.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>8:21</sup>&#8239;I can find no fault in Yu.  His food and drink were fru&shy;gal, yet his of&shy;fer&shy;ings to the spir&shy;its and gods showed ut&shy;ter de&shy;vo&shy;tion.  His clothes were coarse, yet his rit&shy;u&shy;al cap and robes were mag&shy;nif&shy;i&shy;cent.  His dwell&shy;ing was hum&shy;ble, yet he ex&shy;hausted his strength on ir&shy;ri&shy;ga&shy;tion ditches and ca&shy;nals.
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>9:3</sup>&#8239;The rules of rit&shy;u&shy;al pre&shy;scribe a hemp cap.  Now&shy;a&shy;days it is made of silk.  That is more fru&shy;gal.  I fol&shy;low the com&shy;mon prac&shy;tice. The rules of rit&shy;u&shy;al pre&shy;scribe bow&shy;ing be&shy;low the steps. Now&shy;a&shy;days peo&shy;ple bow af&shy;ter as&shy;cend&shy;ing.  That is ar&shy;ro&shy;gant.  Al&shy;though it goes a&shy;gainst the com&shy;mon prac&shy;tice, I bow be&shy;low the steps.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>9:4</sup>&#8239;Con&shy;fu&shy;cius for&shy;bade four things: don&#x02BC;t act on spec&shy;u&shy;la&shy;tion, don&#x02BC;t de&shy;mand cer&shy;tain&shy;ty, don&#x02BC;t be stub&shy;born, and don&#x02BC;t be e&shy;go&shy;tis&shy;ti&shy;cal.

<p>
    <sup>9:5</sup>&#8239;When Con&shy;fu&shy;cius was in dan&shy;ger in Kuang, he said, <q>Since King Wen died, doesn&#x02BC;t his cul&shy;ture re&shy;side in me? If Heav&shy;en doesn&#x02BC;t want this cul&shy;ture de&shy;stroyed, what can the peo&shy;ple of Kuang do to me?</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>9:6</sup>&#8239;I was poor when I was young, so I learn&shy;ed man&shy;y me&shy;ni&shy;al skills. Must a su&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;or man be skilled in man&shy;y things? No, not man&shy;y.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>9:8</sup>&#8239;Do I have knowl&shy;edge? No, I do not.  A rus&shy;tic asked me a ques&shy;tion and my mind went blank.  I ham&shy;mered at both ends of the ques&shy;tion un&shy;til I got eve&shy;ry&shy;thing out of it.
</p>

    <sup>9:13</sup>&#8239;Zigong asked, <q>If you had a beau&shy;ti&shy;ful piece of jade here, would you hide it safe&shy;ly in a box or try to get a good price and sell it?</q> Con&shy;fu&shy;cius said, <q>Sell it! All I&#x02BC;m waiting for is the right of&shy;fer.</q>

<p>
    <sup>9:18</sup>&#8239;I have nev&shy;er seen a man who loves vir&shy;tue as much as he loves beau&shy;ty in wom&shy;en.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>9:19</sup>&#8239;It&#x02BC;s like build&shy;ing a mound: if I stop be&shy;fore the last bas&shy;ket of earth, it re&shy;mains un&shy;fin&shy;ished.  It&#x02BC;s like fill&shy;ing a ditch: al&shy;though I&#x02BC;ve dumped in on&shy;ly a sin&shy;gle bas&shy;ket of earth, if I con&shy;tin&shy;ue then I&#x02BC;m mak&shy;ing prog&shy;ress.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>9:23</sup>&#8239;The young&shy;er gen&shy;er&shy;a&shy;tion should be held in awe.  How do we know that it will not e&shy;qual the pres&shy;ent one?  But if a man reaches for&shy;ty or fif&shy;ty years old with&shy;out dis&shy;tin&shy;guish&shy;ing him&shy;self, he no long&shy;er de&shy;serves awe.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>9:24</sup>&#8239;I can do noth&shy;ing with the man who en&shy;joys po&shy;lite words with&shy;out unfolding their pur&shy;pose, or who a&shy;grees with ex&shy;em&shy;pla&shy;ry words with&shy;out reforming him&shy;self.

<p>
    <sup>9:25</sup>&#8239;Put loy&shy;al&shy;ty and trust&shy;wor&shy;thi&shy;ness a&shy;bove eve&shy;ry&shy;thing else.  On&shy;ly have friends who are your mor&shy;al e&shy;quals.  When you make a mis&shy;take, don&#x02BC;t be a&shy;fraid to cor&shy;rect it.

    <sup>62</sup>&#8239;He worries, <q>I have sons, and I have wealth,</q> but he him&shy;self is not his own, how much less sons and wealth?
</p>

<p>
    <sup>63</sup>&#8239;A fool who knows his own fool&shy;ish&shy;ness, is wise to that ex&shy;tent. But a fool who thinks he is wise, is a fool in&shy;deed.
    <sup>64</sup>&#8239;E&shy;ven if a fool as&shy;so&shy;ci&shy;ates with a wise man all his life, he will per&shy;ceive the truth no more than a spoon per&shy;ceives the fla&shy;vor of the soup.
    <sup>65</sup>&#8239;If an in&shy;tel&shy;li&shy;gent man as&shy;so&shy;ci&shy;ates with a wise man for on&shy;ly one min&shy;ute, he will soon per&shy;ceive the truth as the tongue per&shy;ceives the taste of soup.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>66</sup>&#8239;Fools of lit&shy;tle un&shy;der&shy;stand&shy;ing are their own enemies, for they do evil deeds that bear bit&shy;ter fruit.
    <sup>67</sup>&#8239;That deed is poor&shy;ly done if a man must re&shy;pent af&shy;ter&shy;ward, and its re&shy;ward is cry&shy;ing and a tear&shy;ful face.
    <sup>68</sup>&#8239;That deed is well done if a man does not re&shy;pent af&shy;ter&shy;ward, and its re&shy;ward is de&shy;light and hap&shy;pi&shy;ness.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>69</sup>&#8239;As long as an evil deed does not bear fruit, the fool thinks it is like hon&shy;ey. But when it rip&shy;ens, then the fool suf&shy;fers grief.
    <sup>70</sup>&#8239;E&shy;ven if a fool, month af&shy;ter month, eats his food like an as&shy;cet&shy;ic with the tip of a blade of grass, he is not worth e&shy;ven one six&shy;teenth of those who have un&shy;der&shy;stood the truth.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>71</sup>&#8239;An evil deed, like fresh&shy;ly drawn milk, does not sour im&shy;me&shy;di&shy;ate&shy;ly; it fol&shy;lows the fool, smoldering, like fire cov&shy;ered by ash&shy;es.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>73</sup>&#8239;The fool wishes for a false rep&shy;u&shy;ta&shy;tion, for prec&shy;e&shy;dence a&shy;mong monks, for au&shy;thor&shy;i&shy;ty in the monasteries, for hon&shy;or a&shy;mong oth&shy;er peo&shy;ple.
    <sup>74</sup>&#8239;<q>May both laymen and monks think that I did it. Let them o&shy;bey me in eve&shy;ry&shy;thing, great and small.</q>  Such is the mind of the fool, and thus his de&shy;sire and pride in&shy;crease.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>75</sup>&#8239;One road leads to wealth, an&shy;oth&shy;er road leads to sal&shy;va&shy;tion. If the monk, a dis&shy;ci&shy;ple of Bud&shy;dha, has learn&shy;ed this, he will not yearn for hon&shy;or, he will strive for sep&shy;a&shy;ra&shy;tion from the world.

    <sup>77</sup>&#8239;Let him ad&shy;mon&shy;ish, let him teach, let him re&shy;strain you from what is im&shy;prop&shy;er. The good will love him. The bad will hate him.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>78</sup>&#8239;Do not have evil&shy;do&shy;ers as com&shy;pan&shy;ions, do not have vile peo&shy;ple as friends. Have vir&shy;tu&shy;ous peo&shy;ple as com&shy;pan&shy;ions, have the best as friends.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>79</sup>&#8239;He who drinks in the law lives hap&shy;pi&shy;ly with a se&shy;rene mind. The wise man re&shy;joices al&shy;ways in the law, as preached by the no&shy;ble ones.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>80</sup>&#8239;Ir&shy;ri&shy;ga&shy;tors guide the wa&shy;ter. Fletch&shy;ers straight&shy;en the ar&shy;row. Car&shy;pen&shy;ters shape the wood. The wise con&shy;trol them&shy;selves.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>81</sup>&#8239;Just as a sol&shy;id rock is not shak&shy;en by the wind, the wise do not fal&shy;ter a&shy;midst blame or praise.
    <sup>82</sup>&#8239;Af&shy;ter they have lis&shy;tened to the law, the wise be&shy;come se&shy;rene, like a deep, smooth, and still lake.

    <sup>83</sup>&#8239;The good keep walk&shy;ing what&shy;ev&shy;er hap&shy;pens. The good do not prat&shy;tle, long&shy;ing for pleas&shy;ure. Wheth&shy;er tou&shy;ched by hap&shy;pi&shy;ness or sor&shy;row, the wise nev&shy;er ap&shy;pear e&shy;lat&shy;ed or de&shy;pressed.
    <sup>84</sup>&#8239;A man is good, wise, and vir&shy;tu&shy;ous if he does no wrong for his own sa&shy;ke or for the sa&shy;ke of oth&shy;ers, if he wishes nei&shy;ther for wealth, a son, or a king&shy;dom, and if he does not wish for suc&shy;cess by un&shy;fair means.

<p>
    <sup>85</sup>&#8239;Few a&shy;mong men ar&shy;rive at the oth&shy;er shore (sal&shy;va&shy;tion).  The rest run up and down on this shore.

</p>

<p>
    <sup>87</sup>&#8239;Let a wise man leave the dark way, and fol&shy;low the bright path. Af&shy;ter go&shy;ing from his home to home&shy;less&shy;ness, let him yearn for de&shy;light in de&shy;tach&shy;ment, so dif&shy;fi&shy;cult to en&shy;joy.
    <sup>88</sup>&#8239;Leav&shy;ing all pleas&shy;ures be&shy;hind, and call&shy;ing noth&shy;ing his own, let the wise man cleanse him&shy;self of that which de&shy;files the mind.
    <sup>89</sup>&#8239;Those whose minds are well grounded in the fac&shy;tors of en&shy;light&shy;en&shy;ment, who with&shy;out cling&shy;ing to any&shy;thing, re&shy;joice in free&shy;dom from at&shy;tach&shy;ment, whose ap&shy;pe&shy;tites have been con&shy;quered, and who are full of light, are free e&shy;ven in this world.

<p>

    <sup>95</sup>&#8239;Like the earth, he is not pro&shy;voked. He is firm like a pil&shy;lar.  He is like a pure lake with&shy;out mud. No new births are in store for him.

<p>
    <sup>96</sup>&#8239;His mind is calm, and calm are his words and deeds. By true knowl&shy;edge, he has ob&shy;tained free&shy;dom, and thus be&shy;come tran&shy;quil.

    <sup>99</sup>&#8239;De&shy;light&shy;ful are the for&shy;ests in which the crowds find no pleas&shy;ure. Those with&shy;out pas&shy;sion will find de&shy;light there, for they do not seek pleas&shy;ure.

    <sup>160</sup>&#8239;A man is tru&shy;ly his own pro&shy;tec&shy;tor.  Who else could be the pro&shy;tec&shy;tor?  With self well con&shy;trolled, one finds a pro&shy;tec&shy;tor such as few can find.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>161</sup>&#8239;The evil a fool&shy;ish man does by him&shy;self, self-born, self-created, grinds him down, as a dia&shy;mond breaks a hard gem.
    <sup>162</sup>&#8239;When o&shy;ver&shy;spread with great wick&shy;ed&shy;ness, like a tree cov&shy;ered by vines, a man brings him&shy;self down to where his en&shy;e&shy;my wishes.
    <sup>163</sup>&#8239;Evil deeds, which harm our&shy;selves, are eas&shy;y to do.  Good and ben&shy;e&shy;fi&shy;cial deeds are ver&shy;y dif&shy;fi&shy;cult to do.

<p>
    <sup>164</sup>&#8239;The fool who scorns the teach&shy;ings of the wise, of the no&shy;ble, of the right&shy;eous, and fol&shy;lows false doc&shy;trine, is like the bam&shy;boo that dies af&shy;ter bear&shy;ing fruit.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>165</sup>&#8239;Evil is done by one&shy;self, by one&shy;self one is de&shy;filed.  Evil is left un&shy;done by one&shy;self, by one&shy;self is one pu&shy;ri&shy;fied.  Pu&shy;ri&shy;ty and im&shy;pu&shy;ri&shy;ty are one&#x02BC;s own do&shy;ing.  No one can pu&shy;ri&shy;fy an&shy;oth&shy;er.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>166</sup>&#8239;Let no man sac&shy;ri&shy;fice his own wel&shy;fare for that of an&shy;oth&shy;er, how&shy;ev&shy;er great.  Let a man, af&shy;ter dis&shy;cern&shy;ing his own wel&shy;fare, be al&shy;ways at&shy;ten&shy;tive to it.

    <sup>170</sup>&#8239;The king of death does not see him who looks up&shy;on the world as a bub&shy;ble, as a mi&shy;rage.
    <sup>171</sup>&#8239;Come look at this world, dec&shy;o&shy;rat&shy;ed like a roy&shy;al char&shy;i&shy;ot.  Fools are im&shy;mersed in it, but the wise do not cling to it.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>172</sup>&#8239;He who was reck&shy;less and then be&shy;comes mind&shy;ful, bright&shy;ens up this world like the moon when freed from clouds.

    <sup>174</sup>&#8239;In this dark world, on&shy;ly a few can see.  On&shy;ly a few, like birds es&shy;cap&shy;ing from the net, go to heav&shy;en.
    <sup>175</sup>&#8239;Swans fly on the path of the sun, through the air by their won&shy;der&shy;ful pow&shy;er.  The wise flee from the world af&shy;ter defeating the temp&shy;ter and his armies.

    <sup>176</sup>&#8239;A man who transgresses the one law, speaks lies, and scoffs at the world be&shy;yond, is ca&shy;pa&shy;ble of any evil.

<p>
    <sup>177</sup>&#8239;Mi&shy;sers do not go to the world of the gods; nei&shy;ther do fools praise gen&shy;er&shy;os&shy;i&shy;ty.  A wise man re&shy;joices in gen&shy;er&shy;os&shy;i&shy;ty, and through it be&shy;comes bless&shy;ed in the world be&shy;yond.

<p>
    <sup>186</sup>&#8239;There is no way to sat&shy;is&shy;fy lusts, e&shy;ven with a show&shy;er of gold coins.  He is wise who knows that lusts give lit&shy;tle sat&shy;is&shy;fac&shy;tion and much pain.

<p>
    <sup>188</sup>&#8239;When threat&shy;ened with dan&shy;ger, men go to man&shy;y a ref&shy;uge: to moun&shy;tains and for&shy;ests, to groves and shrines.
    <sup>189</sup>&#8239;But that is not a se&shy;cure ref&shy;uge, that is not the best ref&shy;uge.  A man is not de&shy;liv&shy;ered from all pain af&shy;ter go&shy;ing to that ref&shy;uge.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>190</sup>&#8239;He who takes ref&shy;uge with the law, the a&shy;wak&shy;ened, and their or&shy;der, sees with clear un&shy;der&shy;stand&shy;ing the four ho&shy;ly truths:
    <sup>191</sup>&#8239;pain, the cause of pain, the de&shy;struc&shy;tion of pain, and the ho&shy;ly eight&shy;fold path that leads to the quieting of pain;
    <sup>192</sup>&#8239;That is a se&shy;cure ref&shy;uge, that is the best ref&shy;uge.  Af&shy;ter go&shy;ing to that ref&shy;uge, a man is de&shy;liv&shy;ered from all pain.

</p>

<p>
    <sup>206</sup>&#8239;The sight of no&shy;ble ones is good.  To live with them is al&shy;ways hap&shy;pi&shy;ness.  If a man does not see fools, he will be tru&shy;ly hap&shy;py.

<p>
    <sup>207</sup>&#8239;He who walks with fools suf&shy;fers for a long time.  Com&shy;pa&shy;ny with fools, as with an en&shy;e&shy;my, is al&shy;ways pain&shy;ful.  Com&shy;pa&shy;ny with the wise is a pleas&shy;ure, like re&shy;un&shy;ion with fam&shy;i&shy;ly.

</p>

<p>
    <sup>210</sup>&#8239;Don&#x02BC;t seek for what is pleas&shy;ant or un&shy;pleas&shy;ant, for it is pain not to see the pleas&shy;ant, and it is pain to see what is un&shy;pleas&shy;ant.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>211</sup>&#8239;There&shy;fore, let no man hold any&shy;thing dear, for loss of the dear is pain&shy;ful.  Those who hold noth&shy;ing dear and hate noth&shy;ing have no fet&shy;ters.

<p>
    <sup>241</sup>&#8239;The im&shy;pu&shy;ri&shy;ty of pray&shy;ers is not re&shy;cit&shy;ing them.  The im&shy;pu&shy;ri&shy;ty of hous&shy;es is not repairing them.  The im&shy;pu&shy;ri&shy;ty of beau&shy;ty is sloth. The im&shy;pu&shy;ri&shy;ty of a watch&shy;man is mind&shy;less&shy;ness.

</p>

<p>
    <sup>249</sup>&#8239;Peo&shy;ple give ac&shy;cord&shy;ing to their faith or con&shy;vic&shy;tion.  If a man worries a&shy;bout the food and drink giv&shy;en to oth&shy;ers, he will find no rest by day or night.

<p>
    <sup>252</sup>&#8239;It is eas&shy;y to see the faults of oth&shy;ers, but dif&shy;fi&shy;cult to see one&#x02BC;s own.  A man win&shy;nows the faults of oth&shy;ers like chaff, but hides his own, like a cheat hides an un&shy;luck&shy;y throw of the dice.

</p>

<p>
    <sup>258</sup>&#8239;A man is not wise just be&shy;cause he talks a lot. He is called wise who is pa&shy;tient, and free from hos&shy;til&shy;i&shy;ty and fear.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>259</sup>&#8239;A man does not up&shy;hold the law just be&shy;cause he talks a lot.  He who has learn&shy;ed on&shy;ly a lit&shy;tle of the law, yet com&shy;pre&shy;hends it and nev&shy;er ne&shy;glects it, he up&shy;holds the law.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>260</sup>&#8239;A man is not an eld&shy;er just be&shy;cause his hair is grey.  He may be ad&shy;vanced in years, but is called <q>one grown old in vain.</q>
    <sup>261</sup>&#8239;He in whom there is truth, vir&shy;tue, love, re&shy;straint, self con&shy;trol, who is free from im&shy;pu&shy;ri&shy;ty, and is wise, he is called an eld&shy;er.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>262</sup>&#8239;El&shy;o&shy;quence or phys&shy;i&shy;cal beau&shy;ty do not make an en&shy;vi&shy;ous, greed&shy;y, dis&shy;hon&shy;est man re&shy;spect&shy;a&shy;ble.
    <sup>263</sup>&#8239;He is called re&shy;spect&shy;a&shy;ble when all these are cut down, up&shy;rooted, and de&shy;stroyed, when he is free from ha&shy;tred, and is wise.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>264</sup>&#8239;An un&shy;dis&shy;ci&shy;plined man who speaks lies does not be&shy;come a monk just by shav&shy;ing his head.  How can he be a monk who is held cap&shy;tive by de&shy;sire and greed?
    <sup>265</sup>&#8239;He who qui&shy;ets evil, both small and large, is called a monk, be&shy;cause he has o&shy;ver&shy;come all evil.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>266</sup>&#8239;A man is not a monk just be&shy;cause he asks for alms.  He who a&shy;dopts the whole law is a monk.
    <sup>267</sup>&#8239;He who is a&shy;bove both good and evil, who is chaste, and who goes through the world with un&shy;der&shy;stand&shy;ing, he in&shy;deed is called a monk.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>268</sup>&#8239;A fool&shy;ish and ig&shy;no&shy;rant man does not be&shy;come a sage just by si&shy;lence.  But the wise, as if hold&shy;ing the scales, chooses good and a&shy;voids evil.
    <sup>269</sup>&#8239;For this rea&shy;son he is a sage.  He who weighs both sides of this world is called a sage.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>270</sup>&#8239;A man does not be&shy;come no&shy;ble by harming liv&shy;ing crea&shy;tures.  He is called no&shy;ble for harming no liv&shy;ing thing.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>271</sup>&#8239;Not by rules and prac&shy;tices, not by much learn&shy;ing, not by great con&shy;cen&shy;tra&shy;tion, not by life in se&shy;clu&shy;sion,
    <sup>272</sup>&#8239;not by think&shy;ing, <q>I en&shy;joy the hap&shy;pi&shy;ness of re&shy;nun&shy;ci&shy;a&shy;tion which no world&shy;ling can know</q>, should the monk be con&shy;fi&shy;dent with&shy;out attaining the ex&shy;tinc&shy;tion of de&shy;sires.
</p>


<h2 id="the-path">The Path</h2>
<p>
    <sup>273</sup>&#8239;Of paths, the Eight&shy;fold is best.  Of truths, the Four No&shy;ble are best.  Of vir&shy;tues, de&shy;tach&shy;ment is best.  Of men, he who has eyes to see is best.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>274</sup>&#8239;This is the on&shy;ly path, there is no oth&shy;er, to pu&shy;ri&shy;fy vi&shy;sion. Fol&shy;low this path and it will be&shy;wil&shy;der the temp&shy;ter.
    <sup>275</sup>&#8239;Fol&shy;low&shy;ing this path will end pain.  Once I un&shy;der&shy;stood how to re&shy;move thorns in the flesh, I preached this path.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>276</sup>&#8239;You your&shy;self must make an ef&shy;fort.  Bud&shy;dhas on&shy;ly show the way. The thought&shy;ful who fol&shy;low the path are freed from the temp&shy;ter&#x02BC;s bonds.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>277</sup>&#8239;<q>All cre&shy;at&shy;ed things are tem&shy;po&shy;rar&shy;y.</q>  He who sees and knows this turns a&shy;way from pain.  This is the path to pu&shy;ri&shy;ty.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>278</sup>&#8239;<q>All cre&shy;at&shy;ed things are pain&shy;ful.</q>  He who sees and knows this turns a&shy;way from pain.  This is the path to pu&shy;ri&shy;ty.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>280</sup>&#8239;He who does not ex&shy;ert him&shy;self when it is time, who, though young and strong, is full of sloth, whose will and mind are weak, that la&shy;zy and i&shy;dle man will nev&shy;er find the path to knowl&shy;edge.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>281</sup>&#8239;Let a man watch his speech, be well re&shy;strained in mind, and nev&shy;er com&shy;mit wrong with his bod&shy;y.  If a man purifies these three cours&shy;es of ac&shy;tion, he will a&shy;chieve the path taught by the wise.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>282</sup>&#8239;Zeal brings knowl&shy;edge.  Lack of zeal loses knowl&shy;edge.  Know&shy;ing these two paths of gain and loss, let a man con&shy;duct him&shy;self so that knowl&shy;edge may grow.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>283</sup>&#8239;Cut down the whole for&shy;est of de&shy;sire, not just one tree.  Dan&shy;ger co&shy;mes from the for&shy;est.  Once you have cut down this for&shy;est and its un&shy;der&shy;growth, monks, you will be free.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>284</sup>&#8239;As long as the smallest crav&shy;ing of man for wom&shy;an is not de&shy;stroyed, his mind is in bond&shy;age, as the suck&shy;ing calf to its moth&shy;er.
    <sup>285</sup>&#8239;Cut out the love of self, like an au&shy;tumn lo&shy;tus with your hand. Cher&shy;ish the road of peace, sal&shy;va&shy;tion, as shown by the a&shy;wak&shy;ened.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>286</sup>&#8239;<q>I will live here dur&shy;ing the rains, and o&shy;ver here in win&shy;ter and sum&shy;mer.</q>  Thus thinks the fool, un&shy;a&shy;ware of ob&shy;struc&shy;tions.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>287</sup>&#8239;Death carries off the man, praised for his chil&shy;dren and flocks, his mind dis&shy;tract&shy;ed, as a flood carries off a sleep&shy;ing vil&shy;lage.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>288</sup>&#8239;For him whom death has seized, kinsmen are no pro&shy;tec&shy;tion. Nei&shy;ther sons, a fa&shy;ther, nor re&shy;la&shy;tions can give shel&shy;ter.
    <sup>289</sup>&#8239;Know&shy;ing this, a wise and good man should quick&shy;ly clear the path lead&shy;ing to sal&shy;va&shy;tion.
</p>


<h2 id="miscellaneous">Mis&shy;cel&shy;la&shy;ne&shy;ous</h2>
<p>
    <sup>290</sup>&#8239;If by leav&shy;ing a small pleas&shy;ure one sees a great pleas&shy;ure, let a wise man leave the small pleas&shy;ure and look to the great.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>291</sup>&#8239;He who seeks pleas&shy;ure for him&shy;self by caus&shy;ing pain to oth&shy;ers is entangled by the bonds of ha&shy;tred, and can&shy;not be free from ha&shy;tred.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>292</sup>&#8239;De&shy;sires al&shy;ways in&shy;crease for un&shy;ru&shy;ly, heed&shy;less peo&shy;ple who ne&shy;glect what should be done and do what should not be done.
    <sup>293</sup>&#8239;But de&shy;sires will come to an end for watch&shy;ful, wise peo&shy;ple who do not do what should not be done, who stead&shy;fast&shy;ly do what should be done, and whose whole watch&shy;ful&shy;ness is al&shy;ways di&shy;rect&shy;ed to their bod&shy;y.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>296</sup>&#8239;The dis&shy;ci&shy;ples of Gotama are wide a&shy;wake and vig&shy;i&shy;lant, and their minds day and night are al&shy;ways set on the A&shy;wak&shy;ened,
    <sup>297</sup>&#8239;on the law,
    <sup>298</sup>&#8239;on the church,
    <sup>299</sup>&#8239;and on their bod&shy;y.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>300</sup>&#8239;The dis&shy;ci&shy;ples of Gotama are wide a&shy;wake and vig&shy;i&shy;lant, and their minds day and night al&shy;ways de&shy;light in com&shy;pas&shy;sion,
    <sup>301</sup>&#8239;and in med&shy;i&shy;ta&shy;tion.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>302</sup>&#8239;It is hard to be a monk.  It is hard to en&shy;joy that life. House&shy;hold life is al&shy;so hard and pain&shy;ful.  It is pain&shy;ful to dwell with un&shy;e&shy;quals and the wan&shy;der&shy;ing monk is be&shy;set with pain. There&shy;fore let no man wan&shy;der aim&shy;less&shy;ly and he will not be be&shy;set with pain.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>303</sup>&#8239;A faith&shy;ful, vir&shy;tu&shy;ous, rep&shy;u&shy;ta&shy;ble, and wealth&shy;y man is re&shy;spected wher&shy;ev&shy;er he goes.
    <sup>304</sup>&#8239;Like the Himalayas, good peo&shy;ple shine from a&shy;far.  Like ar&shy;rows shot by night, bad peo&shy;ple are un&shy;seen e&shy;ven when they are near.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>305</sup>&#8239;He who sits a&shy;lone, sleeps a&shy;lone, wa&shy;lks a&shy;lone, is dil&shy;i&shy;gent, and sub&shy;dues him&shy;self a&shy;lone, will re&shy;joice in the sol&shy;i&shy;tude of the for&shy;est.
</p>


<h2 id="hell">Hell</h2>
<p>
    <sup>306</sup>&#8239;He goes to hell, the one who as&shy;serts what didn&#x02BC;t hap&shy;pen, and the one who did a thing but says, <q>I have not done it</q>.  They are both evil&shy;do&shy;ers, and are e&shy;qual in the next world.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>307</sup>&#8239;Man&shy;y men who wear the saf&shy;fron robe are ill-mannered and un&shy;re&shy;strained.  Such evil&shy;do&shy;ers by their evil deeds go to hell.
    <sup>308</sup>&#8239;It would be bet&shy;ter to swal&shy;low an i&shy;ron ball, red-hot and a&shy;flame, than for an im&shy;mor&shy;al, un&shy;re&shy;strained man to eat the alms of the peo&shy;ple.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>309</sup>&#8239;A wreckless man who lies down with his neigh&shy;bor&#x02BC;s wife gains four things: a bad rep&shy;u&shy;ta&shy;tion, poor sleep, pun&shy;ish&shy;ment, and hell.
    <sup>310</sup>&#8239;Th&shy;ere is bad rep&shy;u&shy;ta&shy;tion, an evil des&shy;ti&shy;na&shy;tion, the brief pleas&shy;ure of the fright&shy;ened man and wom&shy;an, and the king im&shy;poses a heav&shy;y pun&shy;ish&shy;ment.  There&shy;fore, let no man lie down with his neigh&shy;bor&#x02BC;s wife.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>311</sup>&#8239;Just as a blade of grass, if wrong&shy;ly han&shy;dled, cuts the hand, so does as&shy;cet&shy;i&shy;cism, if wrong&shy;ly prac&shy;tised, lead to hell.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>312</sup>&#8239;An act per&shy;formed care&shy;less&shy;ly, a bro&shy;ken vow, and ques&shy;tion&shy;a&shy;ble cel&shy;i&shy;ba&shy;cy, none of these bring much re&shy;ward.
    <sup>313</sup>&#8239;If any&shy;thing is to be done, then do it vig&shy;or&shy;ous&shy;ly.  A care&shy;less pil&shy;grim on&shy;ly scat&shy;ters the dust of his pas&shy;sions more wide&shy;ly.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>314</sup>&#8239;It is bet&shy;ter not to do an evil deed, for an evil deed tor&shy;ments a man af&shy;ter&shy;wards.  It is bet&shy;ter to do a good deed, for hav&shy;ing done it, one is not tor&shy;mented.
    <sup>315</sup>&#8239;Like a fron&shy;tier fort with de&shy;fences in&shy;side and out, so let a man guard him&shy;self.  Do not let a mo&shy;ment pass by, for they who al&shy;low the right mo&shy;ment to pass, suf&shy;fer pain when con&shy;signed to hell.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>316</sup>&#8239;They who are a&shy;shamed of what is not shame&shy;ful, and are not a&shy;shamed of what is shame&shy;ful, such men, em&shy;brac&shy;ing false doc&shy;trines go to an evil des&shy;ti&shy;na&shy;tion.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>317</sup>&#8239;They who see dan&shy;ger where there is none, and see no dan&shy;ger where there is, such men, em&shy;brac&shy;ing false doc&shy;trines go to an evil des&shy;ti&shy;na&shy;tion.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>318</sup>&#8239;They who see wrong where there is none, and see no wrong where there is, such men, em&shy;brac&shy;ing false doc&shy;trines go to an evil des&shy;ti&shy;na&shy;tion.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>319</sup>&#8239;They who see wrong as wrong, and see right as right, such men, em&shy;brac&shy;ing true doc&shy;trine go to a good des&shy;ti&shy;na&shy;tion.
</p>


<h2 id="the-elephant">The El&shy;e&shy;phant</h2>
<p>
    <sup>320</sup>&#8239;As an el&shy;e&shy;phant in bat&shy;tle en&shy;dures an ar&shy;row shot from a bow, so will I en&shy;dure def&shy;a&shy;ma&shy;tion.  Man&shy;y peo&shy;ple lack vir&shy;tue.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>321</sup>&#8239;They on&shy;ly lead a tamed el&shy;e&shy;phant in&shy;to crowds.  The king on&shy;ly rides a tamed el&shy;e&shy;phant.  The tamed man who en&shy;dures def&shy;a&shy;ma&shy;tion is the best a&shy;mong men.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>322</sup>&#8239;Trained mules, thor&shy;ough&shy;bred hors&shy;es, and el&shy;e&shy;phants with large tusks are ex&shy;cel&shy;lent, but he who tames him&shy;self is bet&shy;ter still.
    <sup>323</sup>&#8239;For with these an&shy;i&shy;mals no man reaches the un&shy;trod&shy;den coun&shy;try, where a tamed man goes by tam&shy;ing him&shy;self.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>324</sup>&#8239;The el&shy;e&shy;phant called Dhanapalaka, deep in rut, is dif&shy;fi&shy;cult to hold.  He does not eat a mor&shy;sel in cap&shy;tiv&shy;i&shy;ty, but longs for the el&shy;e&shy;phant grove.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>325</sup>&#8239;When a man is in&shy;ac&shy;tive and glut&shy;ton&shy;ous, sleep&shy;ing and roll&shy;ing a&shy;round in bed like an o&shy;ver&shy;fed hog, that fool is born a&shy;gain and a&shy;gain.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>326</sup>&#8239;This mind used to wan&shy;der a&shy;bout as it liked, wher&shy;ev&shy;er it wished, how&shy;ev&shy;er it pleased.  Now I will hold it in check, as a rid&shy;er with a hook con&shy;trols an el&shy;e&shy;phant in rut.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>327</sup>&#8239;De&shy;light in mind&shy;ful&shy;ness.  Watch o&shy;ver your mind.  Lift your&shy;self out of the evil way, as an el&shy;e&shy;phant lifts it&shy;self out of the mud.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>328</sup>&#8239;If you find a wise, pru&shy;dent, and vir&shy;tu&shy;ous friend, then, o&shy;ver&shy;com&shy;ing all dan&shy;gers, walk with him joy&shy;ful&shy;ly and mind&shy;ful&shy;ly.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>329</sup>&#8239;If you find no friend who is wise, pru&shy;dent, and vir&shy;tu&shy;ous, then walk a&shy;lone like a king leav&shy;ing be&shy;hind his king&shy;dom, like an el&shy;e&shy;phant in the for&shy;est.
    <sup>330</sup>&#8239;It is bet&shy;ter to live a&shy;lone.  There is no com&shy;pan&shy;ion&shy;ship with a fool.  Live a&shy;lone, do no evil, and be con&shy;tent, like an el&shy;e&shy;phant in the for&shy;est.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>331</sup>&#8239;These are good: friends when the need a&shy;rises, con&shy;tent&shy;ment with what you have, mer&shy;it in the hour of death, giv&shy;ing up all grief,
    <sup>332</sup>&#8239;serv&shy;ing your moth&shy;er, serv&shy;ing your fa&shy;ther, serv&shy;ing monks, serv&shy;ing ho&shy;ly men,

</p>


<h2 id="craving">Crav&shy;ing</h2>
<p>
    <sup>334</sup>&#8239;The crav&shy;ing of a heed&shy;less man grows like a creep&shy;ing vine.  He runs from life to life, like a mon&shy;key seek&shy;ing fruit in the for&shy;est.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>335</sup>&#8239;He who is o&shy;ver&shy;come by this vile and cling&shy;ing crav&shy;ing, his suf&shy;fer&shy;ing in&shy;creases like grass af&shy;ter rain.
    <sup>336</sup>&#8239;He who o&shy;ver&shy;comes this vile crav&shy;ing, so dif&shy;fi&shy;cult to con&shy;quer, suf&shy;fer&shy;ing falls off him like wa&shy;ter drops from a lo&shy;tus leaf.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>337</sup>&#8239;To all as&shy;sem&shy;bled here I say, <q>Good luck.  Dig up the root of crav&shy;ing, like one seek&shy;ing the sweet scented root of birana grass. Let not the temp&shy;ter crush you a&shy;gain and a&shy;gain, as the stream crushes a reed.</q>
    <sup>338</sup>&#8239;A tree will grow a&shy;gain, e&shy;ven if cut down, as long as its root is safe and firm.  Thus, un&shy;less la&shy;tent crav&shy;ing is de&shy;stroyed, suf&shy;fer&shy;ing will re&shy;turn a&shy;gain and a&shy;gain.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>339</sup>&#8239;The thir&shy;ty six streams of crav&shy;ing flow to&shy;wards pleas&shy;ure. The mis&shy;guid&shy;ed man, in whom they flow strongly, is car&shy;ried a&shy;way.
    <sup>340</sup>&#8239;The streams flow eve&shy;ry&shy;where.  The creep&shy;ing vines of crav&shy;ing grow eve&shy;ry&shy;where.  If you see the vine spring up, cut its root with knowl&shy;edge.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>342</sup>&#8239;Driv&shy;en by crav&shy;ing, men run a&shy;bout like a snared rab&shy;bit.  Held by fet&shy;ters and bonds, they suf&shy;fer a&shy;gain and a&shy;gain for a long time.
    <sup>343</sup>&#8239;Driv&shy;en by crav&shy;ing, men run a&shy;bout like a snared rab&shy;bit.  So a monk should drive out crav&shy;ing, and strive to be with&shy;out pas&shy;sion.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>345</sup>&#8239;The wise do not say that a fet&shy;ter made of i&shy;ron, wood, or hemp is strong.  Far stronger is a long&shy;ing for jew&shy;els and or&shy;na&shy;ments, chil&shy;dren and wives.
    <sup>346</sup>&#8239;The wise say that a strong fet&shy;ter dra&shy;gs one down, though seem&shy;ing loose, it is dif&shy;fi&shy;cult to re&shy;move.  Af&shy;ter hav&shy;ing cut it, the wise are free from cares, and leave the world, de&shy;sires, and pleas&shy;ures be&shy;hind.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>348</sup>&#8239;Give up the past, the fu&shy;ture, and the pres&shy;ent, to cross to the oth&shy;er shore of ex&shy;ist&shy;ence.  If your mind is com&shy;plete&shy;ly free, you will not en&shy;ter in&shy;to birth and de&shy;cay a&shy;gain.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>349</sup>&#8239;If a man is tossed a&shy;bout by doubts, full of pas&shy;sion, and fo&shy;cused on pleas&shy;ure, his crav&shy;ing grows more and more.  He makes his fet&shy;ters strong, in&shy;deed.
    <sup>350</sup>&#8239;If a man de&shy;lights in quieting doubts, is al&shy;ways mind&shy;ful, and med&shy;i&shy;tates on the impurities, he will end crav&shy;ing and cut the fet&shy;ter of the temp&shy;ter.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>351</sup>&#8239;He who has reached the goal is with&shy;out fear, is with&shy;out crav&shy;ing, is with&shy;out blem&shy;ish, and has re&shy;moved all the thorns of life: this will be his last bod&shy;y.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>354</sup>&#8239;The gift of the law ex&shy;ceeds all gifts.  The taste of the law ex&shy;ceeds all tastes.  De&shy;light in the law ex&shy;ceeds all de&shy;lights. The ex&shy;tinc&shy;tion of crav&shy;ing o&shy;ver&shy;comes all suf&shy;fer&shy;ing.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>355</sup>&#8239;Rich&shy;es de&shy;stroy the fool&shy;ish, but not those who seek the be&shy;yond. The fool, by crav&shy;ing for rich&shy;es, de&shy;stroys him&shy;self and oth&shy;ers.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>356</sup>&#8239;Weeds spoil a field.  Pas&shy;sion spoils a man.  There&shy;fore, a gift giv&shy;en to those with&shy;out pas&shy;sion yields great fruit.

<p>
    <sup>357</sup>&#8239;Weeds spoil a field.  Ha&shy;tred spoils a man.  There&shy;fore, a gift giv&shy;en to those with&shy;out ha&shy;tred yields great fruit.

<p>
    <sup>358</sup>&#8239;Weeds spoil a field.  De&shy;lu&shy;sion spoils a man.  There&shy;fore, a gift giv&shy;en to those with&shy;out de&shy;lu&shy;sion yields great fruit.

<h2 id="the-monk">The Monk</h2>
<p>
    <sup>360</sup>&#8239;Good is re&shy;straint o&shy;ver the eye, o&shy;ver the ear, o&shy;ver the nose, and o&shy;ver the tongue.
    <sup>361</sup>&#8239;Good is re&shy;straint in the bod&shy;y, in speech, in mind, in all things. A monk, re&shy;strained in all things, is freed from all suf&shy;fer&shy;ing.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>362</sup>&#8239;He who con&shy;trols his hands, feet, and speech; who is well con&shy;trolled, de&shy;lights in the in&shy;ward, is col&shy;lect&shy;ed, sol&shy;i&shy;tar&shy;y and con&shy;tent, him they call a monk.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>363</sup>&#8239;The monk who con&shy;trols his tongue, speaks mod&shy;er&shy;ate&shy;ly and calm&shy;ly, and teaches the law and its mean&shy;ing, his speech is sweet.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>364</sup>&#8239;The monk who a&shy;bides in the law, de&shy;lights in the law, med&shy;i&shy;tates on the law, and keeps the law in mind, he will nev&shy;er fall a&shy;way from the true law.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>365</sup>&#8239;Let him not des&shy;pise what he has re&shy;ceived, nor en&shy;vy oth&shy;ers.  A monk who envies oth&shy;ers does not ob&shy;tain con&shy;cen&shy;tra&shy;tion.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>366</sup>&#8239;If a monk lives pure&shy;ly, is dil&shy;i&shy;gent, and does not des&shy;pise what he has re&shy;ceived, though he re&shy;ceives lit&shy;tle, then e&shy;ven the gods will praise him.
    <sup>368</sup>&#8239;The monk who a&shy;bides in kind&shy;ness, and is de&shy;vot&shy;ed to the teach&shy;ings of Bud&shy;dha, will at&shy;tain peace, hap&shy;pi&shy;ness, and ces&shy;sa&shy;tion of nat&shy;u&shy;ral de&shy;sires.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>369</sup>&#8239;Monk, bail out this boat.  Once bailed, it will sail light&shy;ly. Hav&shy;ing cut out pas&shy;sion and ha&shy;tred, you will reach Sal&shy;va&shy;tion.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>371</sup>&#8239;Med&shy;i&shy;tate monk.  Be mind&shy;ful.  Do not di&shy;rect your mind to sen&shy;su&shy;al pleas&shy;ure.  Heed&shy;less, do not swal&shy;low the flam&shy;ing i&shy;ron ball lest you cry out when burn&shy;ing, <q>This is suf&shy;fer&shy;ing.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>372</sup>&#8239;There is no med&shy;i&shy;ta&shy;tion with&shy;out in&shy;sight.  There is no in&shy;sight with&shy;out med&shy;i&shy;ta&shy;tion.  He who has in&shy;sight and med&shy;i&shy;ta&shy;tion is near Sal&shy;va&shy;tion.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>373</sup>&#8239;A monk who has en&shy;tered his emp&shy;ty house, whose mind is tran&shy;quil, and who sees the law clear&shy;ly, feels a de&shy;light more than hu&shy;man.
    <sup>374</sup>&#8239;Once he has con&shy;sid&shy;ered the or&shy;i&shy;gin and de&shy;struc&shy;tion of the el&shy;e&shy;ments of the bod&shy;y, he finds hap&shy;pi&shy;ness and joy be&shy;long&shy;ing to those who know the im&shy;mor&shy;tal.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>375</sup>&#8239;This is the be&shy;gin&shy;ning for a wise monk: guarding the sen&shy;ses, con&shy;tent&shy;ment, re&shy;straint un&shy;der the law.
    <sup>376</sup>&#8239;He should have friends who are no&shy;ble, en&shy;er&shy;get&shy;ic, and pure. He should be friend&shy;ly, and skilled in con&shy;duct.  Then, hav&shy;ing much joy, he will put an end to suf&shy;fer&shy;ing.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>377</sup>&#8239;Shed pas&shy;sion and ha&shy;tred, O monks, as the jas&shy;mine plant sheds its with&shy;ered flow&shy;ers.
    <sup>378</sup>&#8239;That monk is called qui&shy;et whose bod&shy;y and speech and mind are calm, who is col&shy;lect&shy;ed, and who has purged the baits of the world.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>379</sup>&#8239;Re&shy;prove your&shy;self and ex&shy;am&shy;ine your&shy;self by your&shy;self.  By be&shy;ing vig&shy;i&shy;lant and at&shy;ten&shy;tive, you will live hap&shy;pi&shy;ly.
    <sup>380</sup>&#8239;You are your own mas&shy;ter and ref&shy;uge.  There&shy;fore, watch o&shy;ver your&shy;self as a mer&shy;chant watches o&shy;ver a good horse.

<p>
    <sup>381</sup>&#8239;The monk who is full of joy, and who has faith in the teach&shy;ings of Bud&shy;dha will reach the qui&shy;et place, ces&shy;sa&shy;tion of nat&shy;u&shy;ral de&shy;sires, and hap&shy;pi&shy;ness.
    <sup>382</sup>&#8239;E&shy;ven a young monk who applies him&shy;self to the teach&shy;ings of Bud&shy;dha bright&shy;ens this world, like the moon set free from clouds.

<h2 id="the-holy-man">The Ho&shy;ly Man</h2>
<p>
    <sup>386</sup>&#8239;He who is mind&shy;ful, blame&shy;less, settled, du&shy;ti&shy;ful, with&shy;out pas&shy;sions, and who has at&shy;tained the highest goal, him I call a ho&shy;ly man.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>387</sup>&#8239;The sun shines by day, the moon shines by night, the war&shy;ri&shy;or shines in ar&shy;mor, the ho&shy;ly man shines in med&shy;i&shy;ta&shy;tion.  But the A&shy;wak&shy;ened One shines with splen&shy;dor day and night.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>388</sup>&#8239;A man is called ho&shy;ly for discarding evil, con&shy;tem&shy;pla&shy;tive for walk&shy;ing qui&shy;et&shy;ly, a pil&shy;grim for leav&shy;ing his own impurities.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>389</sup>&#8239;No one should at&shy;tack a ho&shy;ly man, but no ho&shy;ly man, if at&shy;tacked, should give in to his an&shy;ger.  Shame on him who at&shy;tacks a ho&shy;ly man, but more shame to him who gives in to his an&shy;ger.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>390</sup>&#8239;Noth&shy;ing is bet&shy;ter for a ho&shy;ly man than to hold his mind back from the pleas&shy;ures of life.  When all de&shy;sire to in&shy;jure has van&shy;ished, pain ceases.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>391</sup>&#8239;I call him a ho&shy;ly man who does not of&shy;fend in bod&shy;y, word, or mind, and is re&shy;strained on these three points.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>392</sup>&#8239;Re&shy;vere that teach&shy;er who has taught you the law as taught by the Bud&shy;dha, just as a ho&shy;ly man&shy;y re&shy;veres the sac&shy;ri&shy;fi&shy;cial fire.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>393</sup>&#8239;A man does not be&shy;come ho&shy;ly by his mat&shy;ted hair, by his fam&shy;i&shy;ly, or by birth.  He in whom there is truth and right&shy;eous&shy;ness, he is pure, he is a ho&shy;ly man.
    <sup>394</sup>&#8239;What use is mat&shy;ted hair, O fool?  What use is your coat of goat skins?  The tan&shy;gle is with&shy;in you, but you comb the out&shy;side.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>397</sup>&#8239;I call him a ho&shy;ly man who has cut eve&shy;ry fet&shy;ter, is fear&shy;less, in&shy;de&shy;pend&shy;ent and unshackled.

</p>

<p>
    <sup>401</sup>&#8239;I call him a ho&shy;ly man who does not cling to pleas&shy;ures, like wa&shy;ter on a lo&shy;tus leaf or a mus&shy;tard seed on the tip of a nee&shy;dle.
    <sup>402</sup>&#8239;I call him a ho&shy;ly man who, e&shy;ven here, dis&shy;cerns the end of his suf&shy;fer&shy;ing, has put down his bur&shy;den, and is unshackled.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>403</sup>&#8239;I call him a ho&shy;ly man who is wise, has deep un&shy;der&shy;stand&shy;ing, dis&shy;cerns the right and wrong path, and has reached the ul&shy;ti&shy;mate goal.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>404</sup>&#8239;I call him a ho&shy;ly man who keeps a&shy;loof from both laymen and as&shy;cet&shy;ic, who has no per&shy;ma&shy;nent home, and few de&shy;sires.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>405</sup>&#8239;I call him a ho&shy;ly man who re&shy;nounces vi&shy;o&shy;lence to&shy;wards all be&shy;ings, wheth&shy;er weak or strong, and nei&shy;ther kills nor causes oth&shy;ers to kill.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>407</sup>&#8239;I call him a ho&shy;ly man from whom pas&shy;sion and ha&shy;tred, pride and en&shy;vy have dropped like a mus&shy;tard seed from the tip of a nee&shy;dle.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>408</sup>&#8239;I call him a ho&shy;ly man who speaks true and in&shy;struc&shy;tive words, free from harsh&shy;ness, so that he of&shy;fends no one.
    <sup>409</sup>&#8239;I call him a ho&shy;ly man who on&shy;ly takes what is giv&shy;en to him, be it long or short, small or large, good or bad.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>412</sup>&#8239;I call him a ho&shy;ly man who, in this world, is a&shy;bove at&shy;tach&shy;ment to mer&shy;it and evil, is with&shy;out grief, stain&shy;less, and pure.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>416</sup>&#8239;I call him a ho&shy;ly man who, leav&shy;ing all crav&shy;ing, trav&shy;els with&shy;out a home, and in whom all crav&shy;ing is ex&shy;tinct.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>417</sup>&#8239;I call him a ho&shy;ly man who, af&shy;ter leav&shy;ing all at&shy;tach&shy;ment to men, has ris&shy;en a&shy;bove all at&shy;tach&shy;ment to the gods, and is free from eve&shy;ry at&shy;tach&shy;ment.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>421</sup>&#8239;I call him a ho&shy;ly man who does not cling to past, pres&shy;ent, or fu&shy;ture, who has noth&shy;ing, who clings to noth&shy;ing.

<p>
    <sup>422</sup>&#8239;I call him a ho&shy;ly man, the fear&shy;less, the no&shy;ble, the he&shy;ro&shy;ic, the great sage, the con&shy;quer&shy;or, the pas&shy;sion&shy;less, the pure, the a&shy;wak&shy;ened.

    <sup>2:27</sup>&#8239;He said to them, <q>The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath.</q>

<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>3:1</sup>&#8239;He en&shy;tered the syn&shy;a&shy;gogue a&shy;gain, and a man with a with&shy;ered hand was there.
    <sup>2</sup>&#8239;They watched Jesus to see if he would heal him on the Sabbath, so that they might ac&shy;cuse him.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>3:3</sup>&#8239;He said to the man with the with&shy;ered hand, <q>Come for&shy;ward.</q>
    <sup>4</sup>&#8239;He asked them, <q>Is it law&shy;ful on the Sabbath to do good or to do harm, to save life or to kill?</q> But they were si&shy;lent.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>3:5</sup>&#8239;He looked a&shy;round at them with an&shy;ger, grieved at the hard&shy;ness of their hearts, and said to the man, <q>Stretch out your hand.</q> He stretched it out, and his hand was re&shy;stored.
    <sup>6</sup>&#8239;The Pharisees went out and im&shy;me&shy;di&shy;ate&shy;ly held coun&shy;sel with the Herodians a&shy;gainst him, how to de&shy;stroy him.

</p>

<p>
    <sup>3:9</sup>&#8239;Be&shy;cause of the crowd, he told his dis&shy;ci&shy;ples to have a boat wait for him, so they wouldn&#x02BC;t crush him.
    <sup>10</sup>&#8239;Since he had healed so man&shy;y, eve&shy;ry&shy;one who had dis&shy;eases pressed a&shy;round him to tou&shy;ch him.
    <sup>11</sup>&#8239;When&shy;ev&shy;er the un&shy;clean spir&shy;its saw him, they fell down in front of him, and cried out, <q>You are the son of God.</q>
    <sup>12</sup>&#8239;And he sternly or&shy;dered them not to make him known.
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>3:13</sup>&#8239;He went up on the moun&shy;tain and sum&shy;moned those he wanted, and they came to him.
    <sup>14</sup>&#8239;He ap&shy;point&shy;ed twelve, whom he al&shy;so named a&shy;pos&shy;tles, to be with him, and to send them out to preach,
    <sup>15</sup>&#8239;and to have au&shy;thor&shy;i&shy;ty to cast out de&shy;mons.

<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>3:22</sup>&#8239;The scr&shy;ibes said, <q>He casts out de&shy;mons by the prince of de&shy;mons.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>3:23</sup>&#8239;He called them o&shy;ver to him, and said to them in par&shy;a&shy;bles, <q>How can the temp&shy;ter cast out the temp&shy;ter?
    <sup>24</sup>&#8239;If a king&shy;dom is di&shy;vid&shy;ed a&shy;gainst it&shy;self, that king&shy;dom can&shy;not stand.
    <sup>25</sup>&#8239;If a house is di&shy;vid&shy;ed a&shy;gainst it&shy;self, that house will not be a&shy;ble to stand.
    <sup>26</sup>&#8239;If the temp&shy;ter has ris&shy;en up a&shy;gainst him&shy;self, and is di&shy;vid&shy;ed, he can&shy;not stand, but is fin&shy;ished.
    <sup>27</sup>&#8239;No one can en&shy;ter a strong man&#x02BC;s house, and plun&shy;der his goods, un&shy;less he first ties up the strong man, and then he can plun&shy;der his house.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>3:28</sup>&#8239;<q>Tru&shy;ly I say to you, the sons of men will be for&shy;giv&shy;en all sins and what&shy;ev&shy;er blasphemies they speak,
    <sup>29</sup>&#8239;but who&shy;ev&shy;er blas&shy;phemes a&shy;gainst the ho&shy;ly spir&shy;it will nev&shy;er be for&shy;giv&shy;en, but is guilt&shy;y of an e&shy;ter&shy;nal sin,</q>
    <sup>30</sup>&#8239;be&shy;cause they said, <q>He has an un&shy;clean spir&shy;it.</q>
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>3:32</sup>&#8239;A crowd was sit&shy;ting a&shy;round him, and said to him, <q>Your moth&shy;er and broth&shy;ers are out&shy;side looking for you.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>3:33</sup>&#8239;He an&shy;swered them, <q>Who are my moth&shy;er and my broth&shy;ers?</q>
    <sup>34</sup>&#8239;Looking at those seated a&shy;round him, he said, <q>Here are my moth&shy;er and my broth&shy;ers.

<p>
    <sup>4:1</sup>&#8239;He be&shy;gan to teach by the sea a&shy;gain. A ver&shy;y great crowd gath&shy;ered a&shy;round him, so he got in&shy;to a boat on the sea and sat down.  The whole crowd was by the sea on the land.
    <sup>2</sup>&#8239;He taught them man&shy;y things in par&shy;a&shy;bles, and in his teach&shy;ing said to them,
    <sup>3</sup>&#8239;<q>A sower went out to sow.
    <sup>4</sup>&#8239;As he sowed, some seed fell a&shy;long the path, and the birds came and de&shy;voured it.
    <sup>5</sup>&#8239;Oth&shy;er seed fell on rock&shy;y ground, where it had lit&shy;tle soil.  It sprang up quick&shy;ly, be&shy;cause it had no depth of soil.
    <sup>6</sup>&#8239;When the sun rose, it was scorched. Be&shy;cause it had no root, it with&shy;ered a&shy;way.
    <sup>7</sup>&#8239;Oth&shy;er seed fell a&shy;mong thorns. The thorns grew up, and choked it, and it pro&shy;duced no grain.
    <sup>8</sup>&#8239;Oth&shy;er seed fell on good soil. It grew up, in&shy;creased, and pro&shy;duced grain, bring&shy;ing forth thir&shy;ty, six&shy;ty, and a hun&shy;dred&shy;fold.
    <sup>9</sup>&#8239;He who has ears to hear, let him hear.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>4:10</sup>&#8239;When he was a&shy;lone, those a&shy;round him with the twelve asked him a&shy;bout the par&shy;a&shy;bles.
    <sup>14</sup>&#8239;He said to them, <q>The sower sows the word.
    <sup>15</sup>&#8239;These are the ones a&shy;long the path, where the word is sown.  When they hear, im&shy;me&shy;di&shy;ate&shy;ly the temp&shy;ter co&shy;mes, and takes a&shy;way the word sown in them.
    <sup>16</sup>&#8239;These are the ones sown on rock&shy;y ground. When they hear the word, they im&shy;me&shy;di&shy;ate&shy;ly re&shy;ceive it with joy,
    <sup>17</sup>&#8239;but they have no root in them&shy;selves, and en&shy;dure brief&shy;ly.  When trou&shy;ble or per&shy;se&shy;cu&shy;tion co&shy;mes be&shy;cause of the word, they im&shy;me&shy;di&shy;ate&shy;ly fall a&shy;way.
    <sup>18</sup>&#8239;These are the ones sown a&shy;mong thorns. When they hear the word,
    <sup>19</sup>&#8239;the worries of the world, the de&shy;ceit&shy;ful&shy;ness of rich&shy;es, and the de&shy;sire for oth&shy;er things en&shy;ter in and choke the word, and it be&shy;comes un&shy;fruit&shy;ful.
    <sup>20</sup>&#8239;These are the ones sown on good soil. They hear the word, ac&shy;cept it, and bear fruit: thir&shy;ty, six&shy;ty, and a hun&shy;dred&shy;fold.</q>
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>4:21</sup>&#8239;He said to them, <q>Is a lamp brought in to be put un&shy;der a bas&shy;ket, or un&shy;der a bed, and not on a stand?
    <sup>22</sup>&#8239;Noth&shy;ing is hid&shy;den that will not be re&shy;vealed, and noth&shy;ing is se&shy;cret that will not come to light.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>4:24</sup>&#8239;He said to them, <q>Pay at&shy;ten&shy;tion to what you hear. With the meas&shy;ure you use, it will be meas&shy;ured to you, and e&shy;ven more will be added to you.
    <sup>25</sup>&#8239;For who&shy;ev&shy;er has will be giv&shy;en more; and who&shy;ev&shy;er doesn&#x02BC;t have, e&shy;ven what he has will be tak&shy;en a&shy;way.</q>
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>4:30</sup>&#8239;He said, <q>With what can we com&shy;pare God&#x02BC;s king&shy;dom? What par&shy;a&shy;ble can we use to de&shy;scribe it?
    <sup>31</sup>&#8239;It&#x02BC;s like a mus&shy;tard seed. When sown up&shy;on the soil, it&#x02BC;s smaller than all oth&shy;er seeds on the ground,
    <sup>32</sup>&#8239;yet when it&#x02BC;s sown, it grows up and be&shy;comes larg&shy;er than all the gar&shy;den plants, and puts out large branches, so the birds of the air can nest in its shade.</q>
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>4:36</sup>&#8239;Leav&shy;ing the crowd, they took him with them since he was in the boat; and oth&shy;er boats were with him.
    <sup>37</sup>&#8239;A great wind&shy;storm a&shy;rose, and the waves were br&shy;eak&shy;ing o&shy;ver the boat, so that the boat was al&shy;read&shy;y fill&shy;ing up.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>4:38</sup>&#8239;He was in the stern, sleep&shy;ing on the cush&shy;ion. They woke him up, and said to him, <q>Teach&shy;er, don&#x02BC;t you care that we&#x02BC;re go&shy;ing to die?</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>4:39</sup>&#8239;He woke up, re&shy;buked the wind, and said to the sea, <q>Peace. Be still.</q>  The wind stopped, and there was a great calm.
    <sup>40</sup>&#8239;He said to them, <q>Why are you a&shy;fraid? Do you still have no faith?</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>4:41</sup>&#8239;They were ter&shy;ri&shy;fied, and asked each oth&shy;er, <q>Who is this, that e&shy;ven the wind and the sea o&shy;bey him?</q>
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>5:1</sup>&#8239;They came to the oth&shy;er side of the sea.
    <sup>2</sup>&#8239;As soon as Jesus got out of the boat, a man with an un&shy;clean spir&shy;it came out of the tombs and met him.
    <sup>3</sup>&#8239;He lived in the tombs. No one could bind him any&shy;more, not e&shy;ven with a chain,
    <sup>4</sup>&#8239;be&shy;cause he had of&shy;ten been bound with shack&shy;les and chains, but had torn the chains a&shy;part, and broke the shack&shy;les in pieces.  No one was strong e&shy;nough to sub&shy;due him.
    <sup>5</sup>&#8239;Night and day, in the tombs and in the moun&shy;tains, he was al&shy;ways cry&shy;ing out, and cut&shy;ting him&shy;self with stones.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>5:6</sup>&#8239;When he saw Jesus from a dis&shy;tance, he ran and knelt down in front of him.
    <sup>7</sup>&#8239;He cried out with a loud voice, <q>What do you want with me, Jesus, you son of the most high God? I beg you by God, not to tor&shy;ment me.</q>
    <sup>8</sup>&#8239;For he had said to him, <q>Come out of the man, you un&shy;clean spir&shy;it.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>5:11</sup>&#8239;There was a large herd of pigs on the hill&shy;side, feed&shy;ing.
    <sup>13</sup>&#8239;So he gave the spir&shy;its per&shy;mis&shy;sion to en&shy;ter the pigs. The un&shy;clean spir&shy;its came out, and en&shy;tered the pigs.  The herd of a&shy;bout two thou&shy;sand rushed down the steep bank in&shy;to the sea and drowned.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>5:14</sup>&#8239;The herdsmen fled and told it in the cit&shy;y and the coun&shy;try&shy;side. Peo&shy;ple came to see what had hap&shy;pened.
    <sup>15</sup>&#8239;They came to Jesus, and saw him who had been pos&shy;sessed with the de&shy;mons, sit&shy;ting, clothed, and in his right mind; and they were a&shy;fraid.
    <sup>16</sup>&#8239;Those who had seen it de&shy;scribed to them what had hap&shy;pened to the de&shy;mon-possessed man and the pigs.
    <sup>17</sup>&#8239;They be&shy;gan to beg Jesus to leave their re&shy;gion.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>5:18</sup>&#8239;As he was entering the boat, the man who had been pos&shy;sessed with de&shy;mons begged to go with him.
    <sup>19</sup>&#8239;He did not let him, but said to him, <q>Go home to your own peo&shy;ple, and tell them how much the Lord has done for you, and how he had mer&shy;cy on you.</q>
    <sup>20</sup>&#8239;He went a&shy;way and be&shy;gan to pro&shy;claim how much Jesus had done for him. Eve&shy;ry&shy;one was a&shy;mazed.
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>5:21</sup>&#8239;When Jesus had crossed a&shy;gain by boat to the oth&shy;er side, a large crowd gath&shy;ered a&shy;round him, and he was by the sea.
    <sup>22</sup>&#8239;One of the syn&shy;a&shy;gogue lead&shy;ers, named Jairus, came. See&shy;ing Jesus, he fell at his feet,
    <sup>23</sup>&#8239;begging him ear&shy;nest&shy;ly, <q>My lit&shy;tle daugh&shy;ter is dy&shy;ing.  Come and lay your hands on her, so that she will get well, and live.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>5:24</sup>&#8239;He went with him.  A large crowd fol&shy;lowed him, and pressed a&shy;round him.
    <sup>25</sup>&#8239;A wom&shy;an, bleed&shy;ing for twelve years,
    <sup>26</sup>&#8239;had suf&shy;fered much un&shy;der man&shy;y doc&shy;tors, and had spent all she had, and was no bet&shy;ter, but rath&shy;er grew worse.
    <sup>27</sup>&#8239;Hav&shy;ing heard a&shy;bout Jesus, she came up be&shy;hind him in the crowd, and tou&shy;ched his cloak.
    <sup>28</sup>&#8239;For she said, <q>If I can just tou&shy;ch his clothes, I&#x02BC;ll get well.</q>
    <sup>29</sup>&#8239;Im&shy;me&shy;di&shy;ate&shy;ly, the flow of blood dried up. She felt in her bod&shy;y that she was healed of her af&shy;flic&shy;tion.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>5:30</sup>&#8239;Jesus re&shy;al&shy;ized at once that pow&shy;er had gone out from him, and turned a&shy;round in the crowd, and said, <q>Who tou&shy;ched my clothes?</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>5:31</sup>&#8239;His dis&shy;ci&shy;ples said to him, <q>You see the crowd press&shy;ing a&shy;round you, and yet you ask, <q>Who tou&shy;ched me?</q></q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>5:32</sup>&#8239;He looked a&shy;round to see who had done it.
    <sup>33</sup>&#8239;The wom&shy;an, fearing and trem&shy;bling, know&shy;ing what had hap&shy;pened to her, came and fell down in front of him, and told him the whole truth.
    <sup>34</sup>&#8239;He said to her, <q>Daugh&shy;ter, your faith has made you well.  Go in peace, and be healed of your af&shy;flic&shy;tion.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>5:35</sup>&#8239;While he was still speak&shy;ing, peo&shy;ple came from Jairus&#x02BC;s house and said, <q>Your daugh&shy;ter is dead. Why both&shy;er the teach&shy;er any&shy;more?</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>5:36</sup>&#8239;Jesus o&shy;ver&shy;heard what they said, and told Jairus, <q>Don&#x02BC;t be a&shy;fraid, just be&shy;lieve.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>5:37</sup>&#8239;He al&shy;lowed no one to fol&shy;low him ex&shy;cept Pe&shy;ter, James, and John.
    <sup>38</sup>&#8239;When they came to Jairus&#x02BC;s house, he saw a com&shy;mo&shy;tion, and peo&shy;ple weep&shy;ing and wailing loud&shy;ly.
    <sup>39</sup>&#8239;He went in&shy;side, and asked them, <q>Why are you mak&shy;ing a com&shy;mo&shy;tion, and weep&shy;ing? The child isn&#x02BC;t dead but a&shy;sleep.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>5:40</sup>&#8239;They laughed at him, but he sent them all out&shy;side. He took the child&#x02BC;s fa&shy;ther and moth&shy;er and those who were with him, and went in to where the child was.
    <sup>41</sup>&#8239;Tak&shy;ing her by the hand, he said to her, <q>Lit&shy;tle girl, I say to you, get up.</q>
    <sup>42</sup>&#8239;Im&shy;me&shy;di&shy;ate&shy;ly the girl got up and be&shy;gan walk&shy;ing. They were com&shy;plete&shy;ly a&shy;mazed.
    <sup>43</sup>&#8239;He gave them strict or&shy;ders that no one should know a&shy;bout this, and told them to give her some&shy;thing to eat.

    <sup>6:1</sup>&#8239;He left there, and went to his home&shy;town, and his dis&shy;ci&shy;ples fol&shy;lowed him.
    <sup>2</sup>&#8239;Wh&shy;en the Sabbath came, he be&shy;gan to teach in the syn&shy;a&shy;gogue.

<p>
    <sup>6:4</sup>&#8239;Jesus said to them, <q>A proph&shy;et is with&shy;out hon&shy;or on&shy;ly in his home&shy;town, am&shy;ong his rel&shy;a&shy;tives, and in his own house&shy;hold.</q>
    <sup>5</sup>&#8239;He could do no mir&shy;a&shy;cle there, ex&shy;cept to lay his hands on a few sick peo&shy;ple, and heal them.

<p>
    <sup>6:12</sup>&#8239;They went out, and preached that peo&shy;ple should re&shy;pent.

    <sup>17</sup>&#8239;For Her&shy;od had mar&shy;ried Herodias, his broth&shy;er&#x02BC;s wife. He had or&shy;dered John to be ar&shy;rested and bound in pris&shy;on for her sa&shy;ke.
    <sup>18</sup>&#8239;For John had been tell&shy;ing Her&shy;od, <q>It&#x02BC;s not law&shy;ful for you to have your broth&shy;er&#x02BC;s wife.</q>
    <sup>19</sup>&#8239;So Herodias had a grudge a&shy;gainst him, and wanted to kill him. But she could not,

<p>
    <sup>1:5</sup>&#8239;There was in the place where I lived an un&shy;u&shy;su&shy;al ex&shy;cite&shy;ment on the sub&shy;ject of re&shy;li&shy;gion.

Yet when the con&shy;verts be&shy;gan to file off, some to one par&shy;ty and some to an&shy;oth&shy;er, it was seen that the seemingly good feel&shy;ings of both the priests and the con&shy;verts were more pre&shy;tend&shy;ed than re&shy;al, lost in a strife of words: priest contending a&shy;gainst priest, and con&shy;vert a&shy;gainst con&shy;vert.

    <sup>12</sup>&#8239;This pas&shy;sage en&shy;tered with great force in&shy;to eve&shy;ry feel&shy;ing of my heart.

    <sup>14</sup>&#8239;So, in ac&shy;cord&shy;ance with my de&shy;ter&shy;mi&shy;na&shy;tion, I re&shy;tired to the woods to make the at&shy;tempt.  It was the first time in my life that I had made the at&shy;tempt to pray vo&shy;cal&shy;ly.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>1:15</sup>&#8239;Hav&shy;ing looked a&shy;round me, and find&shy;ing my&shy;self a&shy;lone, I kneeled down and be&shy;gan to of&shy;fer up the de&shy;sires of my heart to God. I had scarce&shy;ly done so when
    <sup>16</sup>&#8239;I saw a pil&shy;lar of light o&shy;ver my head.
    <sup>17</sup>&#8239;When the light rested up&shy;on me, I saw two per&shy;son&shy;ages. One of them said to me, <q>Jo&shy;seph, this is my be&shy;lov&shy;ed son. Hear him.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>1:18</sup>&#8239;I asked the per&shy;son&shy;ages which of all the sects was right, and which I should join.
    <sup>19</sup>&#8239;I was an&shy;swered that I must join none of them.
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>1:21</sup>&#8239;A few days af&shy;ter I had this vi&shy;sion, I was with one of the preach&shy;ers who was ver&shy;y ac&shy;tive in the re&shy;li&shy;gious ex&shy;cite&shy;ment.  I gave him an ac&shy;count of the vi&shy;sion which I had had.  He treated my com&shy;mu&shy;ni&shy;ca&shy;tion with con&shy;tempt, say&shy;ing that there were no such things as vi&shy;sions or rev&shy;e&shy;la&shy;tions in these days.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>1:22</sup>&#8239;I soon found that my sto&shy;ry had ex&shy;cit&shy;ed a great deal of prej&shy;u&shy;dice a&shy;gainst me a&shy;mong the pro&shy;fes&shy;sors of re&shy;li&shy;gion. They ex&shy;cit&shy;ed the pub&shy;lic mind a&shy;gainst me and cre&shy;at&shy;ed a bit&shy;ter per&shy;se&shy;cu&shy;tion.  This was com&shy;mon a&shy;mong all the sects,
    <sup>23</sup>&#8239;and it of&shy;ten caused me great sor&shy;row.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>1:24</sup>&#8239;How&shy;ev&shy;er, it was nev&shy;er&shy;the&shy;less a fact that I had seen a vi&shy;sion, and all the per&shy;se&shy;cu&shy;tion un&shy;der heav&shy;en could not make it oth&shy;er&shy;wise.
    <sup>25</sup>&#8239;I said in my heart, <q>Why per&shy;se&shy;cute me for tell&shy;ing the truth? For I have seen a vi&shy;sion. I know it, and I know that God knows it, and I can not de&shy;ny it.</q>
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>1:27</sup>&#8239;I con&shy;tin&shy;ued to pur&shy;sue my com&shy;mon vo&shy;ca&shy;tions in life, all the time be&shy;ing
    <sup>28</sup>&#8239;per&shy;se&shy;cut&shy;ed by those who ought to have been my friends and to have treated me kind&shy;ly.  If they sup&shy;posed me to be de&shy;lud&shy;ed, they ought to have en&shy;deav&shy;ored to re&shy;claim me in a prop&shy;er and af&shy;fec&shy;tion&shy;ate man&shy;ner.  I was left to mingling with all kinds of so&shy;ci&shy;e&shy;ty, and fre&shy;quent&shy;ly fell in&shy;to man&shy;y fool&shy;ish er&shy;rors.  In mak&shy;ing this con&shy;fes&shy;sion, no one need sup&shy;pose me guilt&shy;y of any great sins, but I was guilt&shy;y of lev&shy;i&shy;ty and some&shy;times as&shy;so&shy;ci&shy;at&shy;ed with jo&shy;vi&shy;al com&shy;pa&shy;ny.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>1:29</sup>&#8239;In con&shy;se&shy;quence of these things, I of&shy;ten felt con&shy;demned for my weaknesses and im&shy;per&shy;fec&shy;tions.  One eve&shy;ning, I be&shy;took my&shy;self to pray&shy;er and sup&shy;pli&shy;ca&shy;tion to God for for&shy;give&shy;ness of my sins and follies.
    <sup>30</sup>&#8239;While I was call&shy;ing up&shy;on God, I dis&shy;cov&shy;ered a light appearing in my room, and im&shy;me&shy;di&shy;ate&shy;ly a per&shy;son&shy;age ap&shy;peared.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>1:33</sup>&#8239;He called me by name, said that he was a mes&shy;sen&shy;ger from God, and that his name was Moroni.
    <sup>34</sup>&#8239;He said that there was a book, writ&shy;ten up&shy;on gold plates, giv&shy;ing an ac&shy;count of the form&shy;er in&shy;hab&shy;it&shy;ants of this con&shy;ti&shy;nent.
    <sup>42</sup>&#8239;The vi&shy;sion was o&shy;pened to my mind so that I could see the place where the plates were de&shy;pos&shy;ited.
    <sup>46</sup>&#8239;He added a cau&shy;tion, tell&shy;ing me that Satan would try to tempt me to get the plates for the pur&shy;poses of get&shy;ting rich.  This he for&shy;bade me, say&shy;ing that I must on&shy;ly get the plates to glo&shy;ri&shy;fy God.
    <sup>53</sup>&#8239;The mes&shy;sen&shy;ger in&shy;formed me that the time for bring&shy;ing forth the plates would ar&shy;rive in four years.
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>1:54</sup>&#8239;I went at the end of each year to the place where the plates were de&shy;pos&shy;ited.  Each time I found the same mes&shy;sen&shy;ger there, and re&shy;ceived in&shy;struc&shy;tion from him.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>1:59</sup>&#8239;At length, the time ar&shy;rived for obtaining the plates.  Hav&shy;ing gone as u&shy;su&shy;al at the end of an&shy;oth&shy;er year to the place where they were de&shy;pos&shy;ited, the same mes&shy;sen&shy;ger de&shy;liv&shy;ered them to me.
    <sup>67</sup>&#8239;I com&shy;menced to trans&shy;late the Book of Mormon.

    <sup>1:4</sup>&#8239;In the first year of the reign of Zed&shy;e&shy;ki&shy;ah, king of Judah,
    <sup>18</sup>&#8239;God showed my fa&shy;ther, Lehi, man&shy;y things a&shy;bout the de&shy;struc&shy;tion of Je&shy;ru&shy;sa&shy;lem. He went a&shy;mong the peo&shy;ple, and de&shy;clared to them what he had seen.
    <sup>20</sup>&#8239;When the peo&shy;ple heard these things, they were an&shy;gry with him, and sought his life.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:2</sup>&#8239;God com&shy;manded my fa&shy;ther in a dream to take his fam&shy;i&shy;ly, and de&shy;part in&shy;to the wil&shy;der&shy;ness.

</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:11</sup>&#8239;La&shy;man and Lem&shy;uel, my old&shy;er broth&shy;ers, grumbled a&shy;gainst their fa&shy;ther be&shy;cause he had led them out of Je&shy;ru&shy;sa&shy;lem, leav&shy;ing their land, gold, sil&shy;ver, and pre&shy;cious things. They said he had done this be&shy;cause of the fool&shy;ish im&shy;ag&shy;i&shy;na&shy;tions of his heart.
    <sup>13</sup>&#8239;They al&shy;so did not be&shy;lieve that Je&shy;ru&shy;sa&shy;lem could be de&shy;stroyed.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:16</sup>&#8239;I be&shy;lieved all that my fa&shy;ther had spo&shy;ken. There&shy;fore, I did not reb&shy;el a&shy;gainst him like my broth&shy;ers.

    <sup>4</sup>&#8239;There&shy;fore, God has com&shy;manded me that you and your broth&shy;ers should re&shy;turn to Je&shy;ru&shy;sa&shy;lem, go to Laban&#x02BC;s house, seek the re&shy;cords, and bring them here in&shy;to the wil&shy;der&shy;ness.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>3:7</sup>&#8239;I said to my fa&shy;ther, <q>I&#x02BC;ll go and do what God has com&shy;manded, for I know that God gives no com&shy;mand&shy;ments un&shy;less he pre&shy;pares a way to ac&shy;com&shy;plish them.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>3:19</sup>&#8239;I said to my broth&shy;ers, <q>It&#x02BC;s wis&shy;dom in God that we should ob&shy;tain these re&shy;cords, that we may pre&shy;serve for our chil&shy;dren
    <sup>20</sup>&#8239;the words spo&shy;ken by all the ho&shy;ly proph&shy;ets.</q>
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>3:23</sup>&#8239;We went up to the house of Laban.

</p>

<p>
    <sup>5:1</sup>&#8239;Af&shy;ter we re&shy;turned to our fa&shy;ther, he was filled with joy, and al&shy;so my moth&shy;er was ver&shy;y glad.
    <sup>21</sup>&#8239;We had ob&shy;tained the re&shy;cords which God had com&shy;manded us, and found that they had great val&shy;ue to us, be&shy;cause we could pre&shy;serve the com&shy;mand&shy;ments of God for our chil&shy;dren.

    <sup>21</sup>&#8239;I for&shy;gave them all that they had done, and we trav&shy;eled a&shy;gain on our jour&shy;ney.

<p>
    <sup>17:3</sup>&#8239;If the chil&shy;dren of men keep God&#x02BC;s com&shy;mand&shy;ments, he pro&shy;vides means for them to ac&shy;com&shy;plish what he has com&shy;manded.

<p>
    <sup>17:5</sup>&#8239;We came to the land which we called Boun&shy;ti&shy;ful, be&shy;cause it had much fruit and wild hon&shy;ey. God had pre&shy;pared all these things that we might not per&shy;ish.
    <sup>6</sup>&#8239;We pitched our tents by the sea&shy;shore, and re&shy;joiced great&shy;ly.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>17:7</sup>&#8239;God said to me, Nephi,

</p>

<p>
    <sup>17:17</sup>&#8239;When my broth&shy;ers saw that I was a&shy;bout to build a ship, they be&shy;gan to grum&shy;ble a&shy;gainst me, say&shy;ing, <q>Our broth&shy;er is a fool, for he thinks that he can build a ship, and cross these great wa&shy;ters.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>17:19</sup>&#8239;I was deep&shy;ly grieved be&shy;cause of the hard&shy;ness of their hearts. When they saw this they were glad, say&shy;ing, <q>We knew that you couldn&#x02BC;t con&shy;struct a ship, and that you lacked judg&shy;ment.
    <sup>20</sup>&#8239;You&#x02BC;re like our fa&shy;ther, led a&shy;way by the fool&shy;ish im&shy;ag&shy;i&shy;na&shy;tions of his heart. He has led us out of the land of Je&shy;ru&shy;sa&shy;lem, and we&#x02BC;ve wan&shy;dered in the wil&shy;der&shy;ness all these years.</q>
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>18:3</sup>&#8239;I, Nephi, of&shy;ten went up on the moun&shy;tain, and I of&shy;ten prayed to God.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>18:4</sup>&#8239;Af&shy;ter I had fin&shy;ished the ship, my broth&shy;ers saw that it was good, and they humbled them&shy;selves a&shy;gain be&shy;fore God.

<p>
    <sup>19:7</sup>&#8239;The things which some men es&shy;teem to be of great worth, both to the bod&shy;y and soul, oth&shy;ers set at naught.
    <sup>9</sup>&#8239;The world, be&shy;cause of their in&shy;iq&shy;ui&shy;ty, will judge Jesus to be a thing of naught.

</p>

<p>
    <sup>5:5</sup>&#8239;God warned me to de&shy;part from them, and flee in&shy;to the wil&shy;der&shy;ness a&shy;long with all those who would go with me.
    <sup>6</sup>&#8239;There&shy;fore, I took my fam&shy;i&shy;ly, and Sam, my old&shy;er broth&shy;er, and Jacob and Jo&shy;seph, my young&shy;er broth&shy;ers, and al&shy;so my sis&shy;ters, and their families.

</p>

<p>
    <sup>9:28</sup>&#8239;Oh the van&shy;i&shy;ty, and fool&shy;ish&shy;ness of men! When they are learn&shy;ed they think they are wise, and they do not lis&shy;ten to God&#x02BC;s coun&shy;sel, for they set it a&shy;side, sup&shy;pos&shy;ing they know of them&shy;selves, there&shy;fore, their wis&shy;dom is fool&shy;ish&shy;ness and it does not prof&shy;it them.
    <sup>29</sup>&#8239;But to be learn&shy;ed is good if they lis&shy;ten to God&#x02BC;s coun&shy;sels.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>9:30</sup>&#8239;Woe to the rich, who des&shy;pise the poor, and per&shy;se&shy;cute the meek, and whose hearts are on their treas&shy;ures; there&shy;fore, their treas&shy;ure is their God.

    <sup>36</sup>&#8239;and to those who com&shy;mit for&shy;ni&shy;ca&shy;tion.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>9:39</sup>&#8239;Re&shy;mem&shy;ber, the mind set on the flesh is death, and the mind set on the spir&shy;it is e&shy;ter&shy;nal life.
    <sup>45</sup>&#8239;Turn a&shy;way from your sins.

    <sup>10:23</sup>&#8239;Cheer up your hearts, and re&shy;mem&shy;ber that you are free to act for your&shy;selves: to choose the way of ev&shy;er&shy;last&shy;ing death or the way of e&shy;ter&shy;nal life.

<p>
    <sup>2:12</sup>&#8239;Man&shy;y of you have be&shy;gun to search for gold, sil&shy;ver, and pre&shy;cious o&shy;res,
    <sup>13</sup>&#8239;and prov&shy;i&shy;dence has smiled on you most pleas&shy;ing&shy;ly, that you have ob&shy;tained man&shy;y rich&shy;es. Be&shy;cause some of you have ob&shy;tained more a&shy;bun&shy;dant&shy;ly than oth&shy;ers you are lifted up in the pride of your hearts be&shy;cause of the cost&shy;li&shy;ness of your ap&shy;par&shy;el, and per&shy;se&shy;cute oth&shy;ers be&shy;cause you sup&shy;pose that you are bet&shy;ter than they.

</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:17</sup>&#8239;Think of oth&shy;ers like your&shy;selves, be fa&shy;mil&shy;iar with all, and free with your pos&shy;ses&shy;sions, that they may be rich like you.

    <sup>21</sup>&#8239;Don&#x02BC;t you sup&shy;pose that one be&shy;ing is as pre&shy;cious in God&#x02BC;s sight as the oth&shy;er?

<p>
    <sup>2:12</sup>&#8239;I have been al&shy;lowed to spend my days in your serv&shy;ice, and have not sought gold, or sil&shy;ver, or any kind of rich&shy;es from you.

    <sup>19</sup>&#8239;For aren&#x02BC;t we all beg&shy;gars? Don&#x02BC;t we all de&shy;pend on God for all our pos&shy;ses&shy;sions, for food and cloth&shy;ing, for gold and sil&shy;ver, and for all our rich&shy;es of eve&shy;ry kind?
</p>

<p>
    <sup>4:22</sup>&#8239;If you judge the man who pe&shy;ti&shy;tions you for your pos&shy;ses&shy;sions, that he per&shy;ish not, and con&shy;demn him, how much more just will be your con&shy;dem&shy;na&shy;tion for with&shy;hold&shy;ing your pos&shy;ses&shy;sions, which don&#x02BC;t be&shy;long to you but to God.
    <sup>23</sup>&#8239;Woe to that man, for his pos&shy;ses&shy;sions will per&shy;ish with him.  I speak to those who are rich in the things of this world.

    <sup>25</sup>&#8239;If you say this in your hearts you re&shy;main guilt&shy;less. Oth&shy;er&shy;wise you are con&shy;demned, for you cov&shy;et what you have not re&shy;ceived.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>4:26</sup>&#8239;To re&shy;tain for&shy;give&shy;ness of your sins: Share your pos&shy;ses&shy;sions with the poor, eve&shy;ry man ac&shy;cord&shy;ing to what he has, such as feed&shy;ing the hun&shy;gry, cloth&shy;ing the na&shy;ked, visiting the sick and help&shy;ing them, both spiritually and tem&shy;po&shy;ral&shy;ly, ac&shy;cord&shy;ing to their needs.
    <sup>27</sup>&#8239;And see that all this is done in wis&shy;dom and or&shy;der; for it is not nec&shy;es&shy;sar&shy;y for a man to run faster than he has strength. It is ex&shy;pe&shy;di&shy;ent for him to be dil&shy;i&shy;gent, that he might win the prize. There&shy;fore, all things must be done in or&shy;der.

<h2 id="alma">Al&shy;ma</h2>
<p>
    <sup>1:2</sup>&#8239;In the first year of Al&shy;ma&#x02BC;s reign in the judg&shy;ment seat, there was a man named Nehor
    <sup>3</sup>&#8239;who was preaching that eve&shy;ry priest and teach&shy;er should be&shy;come pop&shy;u&shy;lar, and should not la&shy;bor with his hands, but be sup&shy;ported by the peo&shy;ple.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>1:7</sup>&#8239;As he was preaching, Nehor be&shy;gan to con&shy;tend sharp&shy;ly with a man
    <sup>8</sup>&#8239;named Gid&shy;e&shy;on.
    <sup>9</sup>&#8239;Nehor drew his sword and killed Gid&shy;e&shy;on.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>1:10</sup>&#8239;Nehor was brought be&shy;fore Al&shy;ma to be judged.
    <sup>12</sup>&#8239;Al&shy;ma said to him,
    <sup>14</sup>&#8239;<q>You are con&shy;demned to die, ac&shy;cord&shy;ing to the law.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>1:15</sup>&#8239;He suf&shy;fered a shame&shy;ful death,
    <sup>16</sup>&#8239;yet this did not stop priest&shy;craft from spreading through the land, for there were man&shy;y who loved the vain things of the world.
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>1:21</sup>&#8239;There was a strict law a&shy;mong the peo&shy;ple of the church that no one should per&shy;se&shy;cute those who did not be&shy;long to the church.
    <sup>27</sup>&#8239;They im&shy;parted of their pos&shy;ses&shy;sions to the poor, and the needy, and the sick, and the af&shy;flicted. They did not wear ex&shy;pen&shy;sive cloth&shy;ing, yet they were neat and come&shy;ly.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>1:29</sup>&#8239;Be&shy;cause of the stead&shy;i&shy;ness of the church they be&shy;came ver&shy;y rich, hav&shy;ing an a&shy;bun&shy;dance of eve&shy;ry&shy;thing they needed.
    <sup>30</sup>&#8239;In their pros&shy;per&shy;ous cir&shy;cum&shy;stances, they did not send a&shy;way any who were na&shy;ked, or hun&shy;gry, or sick.  They did not set their hearts on rich&shy;es, there&shy;fore they were gen&shy;er&shy;ous to all.
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>4:6</sup>&#8239;The peo&shy;ple of the church be&shy;gan to grow proud be&shy;cause of the great rich&shy;es they had ob&shy;tained by their dil&shy;i&shy;gence.  They were lifted up in their pride, for they be&shy;gan to wear ver&shy;y ex&shy;pen&shy;sive cloth&shy;ing.
    <sup>7</sup>&#8239;Now this caused Al&shy;ma much af&shy;flic&shy;tion.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>4:9</sup>&#8239;There be&shy;gan to be great con&shy;ten&shy;tions a&shy;mong the peo&shy;ple of the church. There was en&shy;vy, strife, mal&shy;ice, per&shy;se&shy;cu&shy;tion, and pride.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>4:15</sup>&#8239;Al&shy;ma, see&shy;ing the af&shy;flic&shy;tions, per&shy;se&shy;cu&shy;tions, and in&shy;e&shy;qual&shy;i&shy;ty, be&shy;gan to be ver&shy;y sorrowful.
    <sup>16</sup>&#8239;He se&shy;lected a wise man, and
    <sup>18</sup>&#8239;de&shy;liv&shy;ered the judg&shy;ment seat to him.
    <sup>19</sup>&#8239;He did this that he him&shy;self might go out a&shy;mong his peo&shy;ple to re&shy;mind them of their du&shy;ty, and to tear down all the pride, craft&shy;i&shy;ness, and con&shy;ten&shy;tion a&shy;mong them.
    <sup>20</sup>&#8239;And thus, Al&shy;ma de&shy;liv&shy;ered up the judg&shy;ment seat, and con&shy;fined him&shy;self whol&shy;ly to the priest&shy;hood of God.
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>5:2</sup>&#8239;This is what Al&shy;ma said to the peo&shy;ple of the church:
</p>

<p>
    <sup>5:14</sup>&#8239;I ask you, have you ex&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;enced a might&shy;y change in your hearts?
    <sup>15</sup>&#8239;Do you look for&shy;ward and view this mor&shy;tal bod&shy;y raised in im&shy;mor&shy;tal&shy;i&shy;ty to stand be&shy;fore God to be judged ac&shy;cord&shy;ing to the deeds which have been done in the mor&shy;tal bod&shy;y?
</p>

<p>
    <sup>5:17</sup>&#8239;Do you im&shy;ag&shy;ine that you can lie to God in that day, and say, <q>God, our works have been right&shy;eous,</q> and that he will save you?
</p>

<p>
    <sup>5:26</sup>&#8239;If you have ex&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;enced a change of heart, can you feel so now?
    <sup>27</sup>&#8239;Have you walked, keep&shy;ing your&shy;selves blame&shy;less be&shy;fore God? Could you say, if you were called to die at this time, that you have been sufficiently hum&shy;ble?
    <sup>28</sup>&#8239;Are you strip&shy;ped of pride? If not, you are not pre&shy;pared to meet God.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>5:30</sup>&#8239;Is there one a&shy;mong you who mocks his broth&shy;er, or heaps per&shy;se&shy;cu&shy;tions on him?
    <sup>31</sup>&#8239;Woe to such a one, for he is not pre&shy;pared, and must re&shy;pent!
</p>

<p>
    <sup>5:57</sup>&#8239;All of you who de&shy;sire to fol&shy;low the voice of the good shep&shy;herd, come out from the wick&shy;ed, be sep&shy;a&shy;rate, and don&#x02BC;t tou&shy;ch their un&shy;clean things.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>7:2</sup>&#8239;If I hadn&#x02BC;t giv&shy;en the judg&shy;ment seat to an&shy;oth&shy;er, to reign in my place, I could not have come at this time.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>7:15</sup>&#8239;Lay a&shy;side eve&shy;ry sin which so eas&shy;i&shy;ly en&shy;tan&shy;gles you, which binds you down to de&shy;struc&shy;tion. Show God that you are will&shy;ing to re&shy;pent of your sins.
    <sup>23</sup>&#8239;Be hum&shy;ble, sub&shy;mis&shy;sive and gen&shy;tle; o&shy;pen to rea&shy;son; full of pa&shy;tience and long-suffering; ex&shy;er&shy;cis&shy;ing self-control in all things; dil&shy;i&shy;gent in keep&shy;ing the com&shy;mand&shy;ments of God at all times; asking for what&shy;ev&shy;er you need, both spir&shy;it&shy;u&shy;al and tem&shy;po&shy;ral; al&shy;ways thanking God for what&shy;ev&shy;er you re&shy;ceive.

</p>

<p>
    <sup>12:12</sup>&#8239;<q>All men must die, and be brought be&shy;fore God to be judged ac&shy;cord&shy;ing to our works.

<p>
    <sup>13:31</sup>&#8239;Al&shy;ma spoke man&shy;y more words to the peo&shy;ple which are not writ&shy;ten in this book.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>3:37</sup>&#8239;In the fif&shy;ty-third year of the reign of the judges, Nephi, the son of Helaman, the son of Helaman, be&shy;gan to reign in the judg&shy;ment seat.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>4:18</sup>&#8239;In the six&shy;ty-second year of the reign of the judges,
    <sup>5:1</sup>&#8239;Nephi de&shy;liv&shy;ered the judg&shy;ment seat to Cezoram,
    <sup>4</sup>&#8239;for Nephi was wea&shy;ry be&shy;cause of the in&shy;iq&shy;ui&shy;ty of the peo&shy;ple. He gave up the judg&shy;ment seat to preach the word of God for the rest of his life, and his broth&shy;er Lehi al&shy;so.
    <sup>5</sup>&#8239;For they re&shy;mem&shy;bered what their fa&shy;ther Helaman had said to them:
</p>

<p>
    <sup>5:6</sup>&#8239;<q>My sons, de&shy;clare these words to the peo&shy;ple:
    <sup>12</sup>&#8239;Re&shy;mem&shy;ber that it is up&shy;on the rock of Christ that you must build your founda&shy;tion; that when the dev&shy;il sends forth his might&shy;y winds, when all his hail and his might&shy;y storm beats up&shy;on you, it will have no pow&shy;er to dra&shy;g you down to the gulf of mis&shy;er&shy;y and end&shy;less woe, be&shy;cause of the rock on which you are built.</q>
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>6:15</sup>&#8239;In the six&shy;ty-sixth year of the reign of the judges, Cezoram was mur&shy;dered.  His son, who had been ap&shy;point&shy;ed by the peo&shy;ple in his place, was al&shy;so mur&shy;dered.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>6:16</sup>&#8239;The peo&shy;ple grew ver&shy;y wick&shy;ed.
    <sup>17</sup>&#8239;For God had bless&shy;ed them so long with the rich&shy;es of the world that they be&shy;gan to set their hearts on their rich&shy;es. They be&shy;gan to seek for prof&shy;it that they might be lifted up one a&shy;bove an&shy;oth&shy;er. There&shy;fore they be&shy;gan to mur&shy;der, rob, and plun&shy;der, to get mon&shy;ey.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>6:18</sup>&#8239;Those mur&shy;der&shy;ers and plunderers were a band formed by Gadianton.
    <sup>22</sup>&#8239;They had signs, and se&shy;cret words to rec&shy;og&shy;nize a broth&shy;er who had en&shy;tered in&shy;to the cov&shy;e&shy;nant, that what&shy;ev&shy;er wick&shy;ed&shy;ness he did he should not be in&shy;jured by those who be&shy;longed to his band.
    <sup>23</sup>&#8239;Thus they might mur&shy;der, plun&shy;der, steal, and com&shy;mit for&shy;ni&shy;ca&shy;tion and all kinds of wick&shy;ed&shy;ness, con&shy;tra&shy;ry to the laws of their coun&shy;try and the laws of God.
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>7:4</sup>&#8239;Nephi saw the peo&shy;ple in a state of aw&shy;ful wick&shy;ed&shy;ness, and the Gadianton rob&shy;bers fill&shy;ing the judg&shy;ment seats, hav&shy;ing u&shy;surped the au&shy;thor&shy;i&shy;ty of the land;
    <sup>5</sup>&#8239;let&shy;ting the guilt&shy;y go un&shy;pun&shy;ished be&shy;cause of their mon&shy;ey; be&shy;ing held in of&shy;fice to get mon&shy;ey and glo&shy;ry of the world, that they might more eas&shy;i&shy;ly com&shy;mit a&shy;dul&shy;ter&shy;y, steal, and kill.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>7:6</sup>&#8239;This great in&shy;iq&shy;ui&shy;ty had come up&shy;on the peo&shy;ple in on&shy;ly a few years.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>7:13</sup>&#8239;Nephi said to the peo&shy;ple,
    <sup>20</sup>&#8239;<q>How could you have for&shy;got&shy;ten God?
    <sup>21</sup>&#8239;Be&shy;hold, it is to get mon&shy;ey, and to be praised of men.
    <sup>26</sup>&#8239;Woe will come to you be&shy;cause of that pride which you have al&shy;lowed to en&shy;ter your hearts, which has lifted you up be&shy;cause of your ver&shy;y great rich&shy;es!</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>8:25</sup>&#8239;<q>You have re&shy;jected the truth, and rebelled a&shy;gainst God. In&shy;stead of stor&shy;ing up for your&shy;selves treas&shy;ures in heav&shy;en, where noth&shy;ing de&shy;stroys, you are ac&shy;cu&shy;mu&shy;lat&shy;ing for your&shy;selves an&shy;ger for the day of judg&shy;ment.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>10:18</sup>&#8239;They would not lis&shy;ten to his words.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>12:1</sup>&#8239;Thus we can see the unsteadiness of the hearts of the chil&shy;dren of men.
    <sup>2</sup>&#8239;At the ver&shy;y time when God pros&shy;pers his peo&shy;ple, do&shy;ing all things for their wel&shy;fare and hap&shy;pi&shy;ness, then is the time that they hard&shy;en their hearts, and for&shy;get God, be&shy;cause of their ease, and ver&shy;y great pros&shy;per&shy;i&shy;ty.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>12:4</sup>&#8239;How fool&shy;ish, vain, and quick to do in&shy;iq&shy;ui&shy;ty, and how slow to do good, are the chil&shy;dren of men. How quick to set their hearts on the vain things of the world!
    <sup>5</sup>&#8239;How quick to be lifted up in pride; how quick to boast; and how slow to re&shy;mem&shy;ber God, and to lis&shy;ten to his guid&shy;ance. How slow to walk in wis&shy;dom&#x02BC;s paths!
</p>

<p>
    <sup>12:6</sup>&#8239;They ne&shy;glect God&#x02BC;s guid&shy;ance, and will not have him as their guide.
    <sup>23</sup>&#8239;Bless&shy;ed are they who will re&shy;pent and lis&shy;ten to the voice of God.
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>13:2</sup>&#8239;There was one Samuel who came in&shy;to the land, and preached re&shy;pent&shy;ance to the peo&shy;ple.
    <sup>4</sup>&#8239;They would not let him en&shy;ter the cit&shy;y, so he got on the cit&shy;y wall, and
    <sup>5</sup>&#8239;said to them:
</p>

<p>
    <sup>13:8</sup>&#8239;God says, <q>Be&shy;cause of the hard&shy;ness of the hearts of the peo&shy;ple, un&shy;less they re&shy;pent I will take a&shy;way my word from them.
    <sup>10</sup>&#8239;Your enemies, of the fourth gen&shy;er&shy;a&shy;tion, will live to see your ut&shy;ter de&shy;struc&shy;tion.</q>
    <sup>21</sup>&#8239;Your rich&shy;es are curs&shy;ed be&shy;cause you have set your hearts on them, and have not lis&shy;tened to the words of him who gave them to you.
    <sup>22</sup>&#8239;You don&#x02BC;t re&shy;mem&shy;ber God in the things with which he has bless&shy;ed you, but you al&shy;ways re&shy;mem&shy;ber your rich&shy;es, not to thank God for them. Your hearts swell with great pride, un&shy;to boasting, en&shy;vy, strife, mal&shy;ice, per&shy;se&shy;cu&shy;tion, mur&shy;der, and all man&shy;ner of in&shy;iq&shy;ui&shy;ty.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>13:24</sup>&#8239;Woe to you, be&shy;cause you drive out the proph&shy;ets, and mock them, and throw stones at them, and kill them, just as they did long a&shy;go.
    <sup>25</sup>&#8239;And now you say, <q>If we had lived in the time of our fa&shy;thers, we would not have killed the proph&shy;ets. We would not have stoned them, and driv&shy;en them out.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>13:26</sup>&#8239;You are worse than they. If a proph&shy;et co&shy;mes to you and de&shy;clares your sins and iniquities, you are an&shy;gry with him, and look for ways to de&shy;stroy him. You will say that he is a false proph&shy;et, be&shy;cause he testifies that your deeds are evil.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>13:27</sup>&#8239;But if a man co&shy;mes to you and says, <q>Do this and there is no in&shy;iq&shy;ui&shy;ty. Walk af&shy;ter the pride of your eyes, and do what&shy;ev&shy;er your heart de&shy;sires,</q> you will say that he is a proph&shy;et.
    <sup>28</sup>&#8239;You will dress him in ex&shy;pen&shy;sive cloth&shy;ing be&shy;cause he speaks flattering words, and says that all is well.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>14:30</sup>&#8239;Re&shy;mem&shy;ber that you are free. You are permitted to act for your&shy;selves. God
    <sup>31</sup>&#8239;has al&shy;lowed you to know good from evil, and to choose life or death. You can do good and have good re&shy;stored to you, or you can do evil and have evil re&shy;stored to you.
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>16:1</sup>&#8239;Man&shy;y heard the words of Samuel, and be&shy;lieved him, and con&shy;fessed their sins.
    <sup>2</sup>&#8239;But those who did not be&shy;lieve Samuel were an&shy;gry with him.  They threw stones and shot ar&shy;rows at him as he stood on the wall, but they could not hit him.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>16:7</sup>&#8239;He jumped down from the wall, fled out of their land,

<p>
    <sup>2:10</sup>&#8239;The peo&shy;ple still re&shy;mained in wick&shy;ed&shy;ness.
    <sup>11</sup>&#8239;The Gadianton rob&shy;bers had be&shy;come so nu&shy;mer&shy;ous, and killed so man&shy;y of the peo&shy;ple, that all the peo&shy;ple

</p>

<p>
    <sup>6:4</sup>&#8239;The peo&shy;ple be&shy;gan a&shy;gain to pros&shy;per, and there was great or&shy;der in the land.
    <sup>5</sup>&#8239;There was noth&shy;ing to hind&shy;er the peo&shy;ple from prospering con&shy;tin&shy;u&shy;al&shy;ly, ex&shy;cept if they fell in&shy;to trans&shy;gres&shy;sion.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>6:10</sup>&#8239;There be&shy;gan to be some dis&shy;putes a&shy;mong the peo&shy;ple, and some were lifted up in pride and boasting be&shy;cause of their ver&shy;y great rich&shy;es, e&shy;ven to great per&shy;se&shy;cu&shy;tions.

    <sup>14</sup>&#8239;And thus there a&shy;rose a great in&shy;e&shy;qual&shy;i&shy;ty in the land, so the church be&shy;gan to be bro&shy;ken up.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>6:15</sup>&#8239;Now the cause of the in&shy;iq&shy;ui&shy;ty was this: the peo&shy;ple were puffing up with pride, seek&shy;ing for pow&shy;er, au&shy;thor&shy;i&shy;ty, rich&shy;es, and the vain things of the world.
    <sup>18</sup>&#8239;They did not sin ig&shy;no&shy;rant&shy;ly, be&shy;cause God&#x02BC;s will had been taught to them, there&shy;fore they wil&shy;ful&shy;ly rebelled a&shy;gainst God.
</p>

Nev&shy;er&shy;the&shy;less, their hearts were turned from God, and they stoned the proph&shy;ets and cast them out.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>7:17</sup>&#8239;Nephi preached man&shy;y things to the peo&shy;ple.

    <sup>3</sup>&#8239;While they were talking with one an&shy;oth&shy;er, they heard a voice as if it came from heav&shy;en.
    <sup>8</sup>&#8239;They looked up, and saw a man descending out of heav&shy;en. He came down and stood a&shy;mong them.
    <sup>9</sup>&#8239;He reached out his hand and spoke to the peo&shy;ple, say&shy;ing,

<p>

    <sup>37</sup>&#8239;but let your state&shy;ment be <q>Yes</q> or <q>No</q>. Any&shy;thing more than this is evil.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>12:38</sup>&#8239;It is writ&shy;ten, an eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth.
    <sup>39</sup>&#8239;But I tell you, don&#x02BC;t re&shy;sist an evil per&shy;son. In&shy;stead, if some&shy;one slaps you on the right cheek, turn to him the oth&shy;er al&shy;so.
    <sup>40</sup>&#8239;If some&shy;one wants to sue you and take your shirt, let him have your coat al&shy;so.
    <sup>41</sup>&#8239;If some&shy;one forces you to go one mile, go with him two.
    <sup>42</sup>&#8239;Give to him who asks you, and don&#x02BC;t turn a&shy;way from him who wants to bor&shy;row from you.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>12:43</sup>&#8239;It is writ&shy;ten, <q>Love your neigh&shy;bor and hate your en&shy;e&shy;my.</q>
    <sup>44</sup>&#8239;But I tell you, love your enemies, bless those who curse you, do good to those who hate you, and pray for those who mis&shy;treat you and per&shy;se&shy;cute you
    <sup>45</sup>&#8239;that you may be sons of God. For he makes his sun rise on the evil and the good.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>13:1</sup>&#8239;You should give to the poor, but be&shy;ware of prac&shy;tic&shy;ing your right&shy;eous&shy;ness be&shy;fore men to be seen by them.
    <sup>2</sup>&#8239;So when you give to the poor, don&#x02BC;t sound a trum&shy;pet be&shy;fore you, as the hyp&shy;o&shy;crites do, to be praised by men. They have their re&shy;ward.
    <sup>3</sup>&#8239;But when you give to the poor, don&#x02BC;t let your left hand know what your right hand is do&shy;ing,
    <sup>4</sup>&#8239;so that your giv&shy;ing may be in se&shy;cret.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>13:5</sup>&#8239;When you pray, don&#x02BC;t do as the hyp&shy;o&shy;crites, for they love to pray to be seen by men. They have their re&shy;ward.
    <sup>6</sup>&#8239;But when you pray, go in&shy;to your room, shut your door, and pray to God who is in se&shy;cret.
    <sup>7</sup>&#8239;When you pray, don&#x02BC;t use mean&shy;ing&shy;less rep&shy;e&shy;ti&shy;tion like the pa&shy;gans, for they think that they will be heard for their man&shy;y words.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>13:16</sup>&#8239;When you fast, don&#x02BC;t look gloom&shy;y like the hyp&shy;o&shy;crites, for they dis&shy;fig&shy;ure their faces to show men that they are fasting. They have their re&shy;ward.
    <sup>17</sup>&#8239;But when you fast, a&shy;noint your head, and wash your face,
    <sup>18</sup>&#8239;so that your fasting is not ob&shy;vi&shy;ous to men, but to God, who is in se&shy;cret.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>13:19</sup>&#8239;Don&#x02BC;t store up for your&shy;selves treas&shy;ures on earth, where moth and rust de&shy;stroy, and thieves break in and steal.
    <sup>20</sup>&#8239;But store up for your&shy;selves treas&shy;ures in heav&shy;en, where nei&shy;ther moth nor rust de&shy;stroys, and where thieves do not break in and steal.
    <sup>21</sup>&#8239;For where your treas&shy;ure is, there your heart will be al&shy;so.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>13:24</sup>&#8239;No one can serve two mas&shy;ters; for ei&shy;ther he will hate the one and love the oth&shy;er, or he will be de&shy;vot&shy;ed to the one and des&shy;pise the oth&shy;er. You can&shy;not serve God and mon&shy;ey.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>14:1</sup>&#8239;Don&#x02BC;t judge, so that you won&#x02BC;t be judged.
    <sup>2</sup>&#8239;For in the way you judge, you will be judged; and with the meas&shy;ure you use, it will be meas&shy;ured to you.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>14:3</sup>&#8239;Why do you look at the speck in your broth&shy;er&#x02BC;s eye, but don&#x02BC;t no&shy;tice the log in your own eye?
    <sup>12</sup>&#8239;There&shy;fore, what&shy;ev&shy;er you want oth&shy;ers to do to you, do al&shy;so to them.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>14:15</sup>&#8239;Be&shy;ware of false proph&shy;ets who come to you in sheep&#x02BC;s cloth&shy;ing, but in&shy;ward&shy;ly are rav&shy;en&shy;ous wolves.
    <sup>16</sup>&#8239;You will rec&shy;og&shy;nize them by their fruits. Are grapes gath&shy;ered from thornbushes, or figs from this&shy;tles?
    <sup>17</sup>&#8239;Like&shy;wise, eve&shy;ry good tree bears good fruit, but a bad tree bears bad fruit.
    <sup>18</sup>&#8239;A good tree can&shy;not bear bad fruit, nor can a bad tree bear good fruit.
    <sup>20</sup>&#8239;So you&#x02BC;ll rec&shy;og&shy;nize them by their fruits.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>14:24</sup>&#8239;Eve&shy;ry&shy;one who hears these words of mine and acts on them will be like a wise man who built his house on the rock.
    <sup>25</sup>&#8239;The rain fell, the floods came, and the winds blew and beat a&shy;gainst that house. Yet it did not fall, be&shy;cause its founda&shy;tion was on the rock.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>14:26</sup>&#8239;Eve&shy;ry&shy;one who hears these words of mine and doesn&#x02BC;t act on them, will be like a fool&shy;ish man who built his house on the sand.
    <sup>27</sup>&#8239;The rain fell, the floods came, and the winds blew and beat a&shy;gainst that house, and it fell.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>15:9</sup>&#8239;Turn to me, and en&shy;dure to the end, and you will live. For to him who en&shy;dures to the end, I will give e&shy;ter&shy;nal life.
    <sup>10</sup>&#8239;I&#x02BC;ve giv&shy;en you the com&shy;mand&shy;ments, there&shy;fore keep my com&shy;mand&shy;ments.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>17:2</sup>&#8239;I can see that you&#x02BC;re weak, that you can&shy;not un&shy;der&shy;stand all that I&#x02BC;m speak&shy;ing to you.
    <sup>3</sup>&#8239;There&shy;fore, go to your homes, and pon&shy;der on the things which I&#x02BC;ve said, and ask God that you may un&shy;der&shy;stand.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>18:18</sup>&#8239;You must watch and pray al&shy;ways to a&shy;void temp&shy;ta&shy;tion.
    <sup>21</sup>&#8239;Pray to God in your families that your wives and your chil&shy;dren may be bless&shy;ed.

    <sup>8:3</sup>&#8239;Our enemies killed my fa&shy;ther, and I a&shy;lone re&shy;main to write the sad tale of the de&shy;struc&shy;tion of my peo&shy;ple.  I don&#x02BC;t know wheth&shy;er they will kill me.
    <sup>5</sup>&#8239;All my rel&shy;a&shy;tives have been killed in bat&shy;tle, and I have no friends, and no&shy;where to go.

    <sup>19</sup>&#8239;for one who judges rash&shy;ly will be judged rash&shy;ly a&shy;gain; for his wages will be ac&shy;cord&shy;ing to his works.
    <sup>20</sup>&#8239;The scrip&shy;ture says, <q><q>Man shall not strike, nei&shy;ther shall he judge, for judg&shy;ment is mine, and venge&shy;ance is mine al&shy;so, and I will re&shy;pay,</q> says God.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>8:22</sup>&#8239;For the e&shy;ter&shy;nal pur&shy;poses of God will roll on un&shy;til all his prom&shy;ises are ful&shy;filled.

    <sup>8:31</sup>&#8239;Man&shy;y will say, <q>Do this, or do that, and it doesn&#x02BC;t mat&shy;ter, for God will up&shy;hold them at the last day.</q> But woe to them, for they are in the gall of bit&shy;ter&shy;ness and in the bonds of in&shy;iq&shy;ui&shy;ty.
    <sup>32</sup>&#8239;Churches will be built up that will say, <q>Come to me, and for your mon&shy;ey you will be for&shy;giv&shy;en of your sins.</q>

    <sup>37</sup>&#8239;For you love mon&shy;ey, and your pos&shy;ses&shy;sions, and your fi&shy;ne cloth&shy;ing, and adorning your churches, more than you love the poor and the needy, the sick and the af&shy;flicted.
</p>

</p>

<p>
    <sup>9:27</sup>&#8239;Don&#x02BC;t doubt, but be&shy;lieve, and come to God with all your heart, and work out your own sal&shy;va&shy;tion with fear and trem&shy;bling be&shy;fore him.
    <sup>28</sup>&#8239;Be wise dur&shy;ing your pro&shy;ba&shy;tion. Strip your&shy;selves of all im&shy;pu&shy;ri&shy;ty. Don&#x02BC;t ask so that you may spend it on your pleas&shy;ures, but ask with an un&shy;wa&shy;ver&shy;ing firm&shy;ness that you will yield to no temp&shy;ta&shy;tion, but serve the true and liv&shy;ing God.

<p>
    <sup>7:1</sup>&#8239;I, Moroni, write some of the words of my fa&shy;ther Mormon.
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>7:2</sup>&#8239;I, Mormon, speak to you.
    <sup>5</sup>&#8239;I re&shy;mem&shy;ber God&#x02BC;s word, which says you will rec&shy;og&shy;nize them by their works, for if their works are good then they are al&shy;so good.
    <sup>6</sup>&#8239;For God has said, an evil man can&shy;not do what is good.  For if he of&shy;fers a gift, or prays to God, un&shy;less he does it with re&shy;al in&shy;tent he gains noth&shy;ing,
    <sup>7</sup>&#8239;for it is not counted to him as right&shy;eous&shy;ness.
    <sup>8</sup>&#8239;For if an evil man gives a gift, he does it re&shy;luc&shy;tant&shy;ly, there&shy;fore it is counted to him the same as if he had re&shy;tained the gift, there&shy;fore he is counted evil be&shy;fore God.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>7:9</sup>&#8239;Like&shy;wise, it is counted evil to a man if he prays with&shy;out re&shy;al in&shy;tent of heart. He gains noth&shy;ing, for God re&shy;ceives none such.
    <sup>10</sup>&#8239;There&shy;fore, an evil man can&shy;not do what is good.
    <sup>11</sup>&#8239;A bit&shy;ter spring can&shy;not pour out good wa&shy;ter; nei&shy;ther can a good spring pour out bit&shy;ter wa&shy;ter.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>7:13</sup>&#8239;That which is of God in&shy;vites and en&shy;tices to do good con&shy;tin&shy;u&shy;al&shy;ly. There&shy;fore, eve&shy;ry&shy;thing which in&shy;vites and en&shy;tices to do good, to love God, and to serve him, is in&shy;spired of God.
    <sup>14</sup>&#8239;Be on guard that you don&#x02BC;t judge what is evil to be of God, or what is good and of God to be of the dev&shy;il.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>7:18</sup>&#8239;See that you don&#x02BC;t judge un&shy;just&shy;ly, for with the same judg&shy;ment that you judge you will al&shy;so be judged.
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>7:44</sup>&#8239;If a man doesn&#x02BC;t have love he is noth&shy;ing.
    <sup>45</sup>&#8239;Love is pa&shy;tient, is kind, does not en&shy;vy, is not ar&shy;ro&shy;gant, is not self-seek&shy;ing, is not ir&shy;ri&shy;ta&shy;ble, keeps no rec&shy;ord of wrongs, does not re&shy;joice in unrighteousness but re&shy;joices in the truth, bears all things, be&shy;lieves all things, hopes all things, and en&shy;dures all things.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>7:46</sup>&#8239;There&shy;fore, love nev&shy;er ends. Hold fast to love, which is the great&shy;est of all, for all things must end,
    <sup>47</sup>&#8239;but love en&shy;dures for&shy;ev&shy;er, and who&shy;ev&shy;er possesses it at the last day, it will go well with him.
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>10:1</sup>&#8239;Now I, Moroni,
    <sup>3</sup>&#8239;ex&shy;hort you that when you read these things, you should re&shy;mem&shy;ber how mer&shy;ci&shy;ful God has been to the chil&shy;dren of men, and pon&shy;der it in your hearts.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>10:8</sup>&#8239;Don&#x02BC;t de&shy;ny the gifts of God, for they are man&shy;y, and they come from the same God. There are dif&shy;fer&shy;ent ways that these gifts are ad&shy;min&shy;is&shy;tered, but it is the same God who works all things in all men, and they are giv&shy;en to prof&shy;it men.
    <sup>9</sup>&#8239;To one is giv&shy;en that he may teach a mes&shy;sage of wis&shy;dom,
    <sup>10</sup>&#8239;to an&shy;oth&shy;er teach&shy;ing a mes&shy;sage of knowl&shy;edge,
    <sup>11</sup>&#8239;to an&shy;oth&shy;er ver&shy;y great faith, to an&shy;oth&shy;er the gifts of heal&shy;ing,
    <sup>12</sup>&#8239;to an&shy;oth&shy;er work&shy;ing might&shy;y mir&shy;a&shy;cles,
    <sup>13</sup>&#8239;to an&shy;oth&shy;er proph&shy;e&shy;sy a&shy;bout all things,
    <sup>14</sup>&#8239;to an&shy;oth&shy;er see&shy;ing an&shy;gels and ministering spir&shy;its,
    <sup>15</sup>&#8239;to an&shy;oth&shy;er all kinds of tongues,
    <sup>16</sup>&#8239;and to an&shy;oth&shy;er the in&shy;ter&shy;pre&shy;ta&shy;tion of lan&shy;guages.
    <sup>17</sup>&#8239;All these gifts come from God to eve&shy;ry man in&shy;di&shy;vid&shy;u&shy;al&shy;ly, as he wills.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>10:21</sup>&#8239;Un&shy;less you have love, faith, and hope, you can&shy;not be saved.
    <sup>22</sup>&#8239;If you don&#x02BC;t have hope you must be in des&shy;pair, and des&shy;pair co&shy;mes be&shy;cause of in&shy;iq&shy;ui&shy;ty.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>10:34</sup>&#8239;I say to all, fare&shy;well. I soon go to rest in God&#x02BC;s par&shy;a&shy;dise.

<p>
    <sup>2:177</sup>&#8239;Right&shy;eous&shy;ness is not turn&shy;ing your faces to&shy;wards east or west, but right&shy;eous&shy;ness is one who be&shy;lieves in God, the Last Day, the an&shy;gels, the Book, and the proph&shy;ets; who gives of his wealth, e&shy;ven though he loves it, to rel&shy;a&shy;tives, or&shy;phans, the needy, the trav&shy;el&shy;er, beg&shy;gars, and for free&shy;ing slaves; who are stead&shy;fast in pray&shy;er, and spend in char&shy;i&shy;ty; who keep their prom&shy;ises; and are pa&shy;tient in pov&shy;er&shy;ty, ad&shy;ver&shy;si&shy;ty, and dur&shy;ing bat&shy;tle.

    <sup>2:183</sup>&#8239;Be&shy;liev&shy;ers, fasting is pre&shy;scribed for you, as it was for those be&shy;fore you, that you may be&shy;come con&shy;scious of God.
    <sup>184</sup>&#8239;Fast for a spe&shy;cif&shy;ic num&shy;ber of days, but if you are sick or trav&shy;el&shy;ing, make up the days lat&shy;er. Those who can on&shy;ly fast with dif&shy;fi&shy;cul&shy;ty may feed a poor per&shy;son in&shy;stead. Who&shy;ev&shy;er vol&shy;un&shy;teers to give more, it is bet&shy;ter for him.
    <sup>185</sup>&#8239;In the month of Ramadan the Qur&#x02BC;an was re&shy;vealed as a guid&shy;ance for man&shy;kind, as a clear sign of that guid&shy;ance, and as judg&shy;ment be&shy;tween right and wrong. So who&shy;ev&shy;er is pres&shy;ent dur&shy;ing that month should fast. God wants ease for you, not hard&shy;ship; and per&shy;haps you will be grate&shy;ful.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:188</sup>&#8239;Don&#x02BC;t con&shy;sume one an&shy;oth&shy;er&#x02BC;s prop&shy;er&shy;ty un&shy;just&shy;ly, nor use it to bribe judges, intending to con&shy;sume some of the prop&shy;er&shy;ty of oth&shy;ers sin&shy;ful&shy;ly and know&shy;ing&shy;ly.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:215</sup>&#8239;What&shy;ev&shy;er you spend in char&shy;i&shy;ty should be for par&shy;ents, close rel&shy;a&shy;tives, or&shy;phans, the poor, and for trav&shy;el&shy;ers.  What&shy;ev&shy;er good you do, God knows it well.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:216</sup>&#8239;You may dis&shy;like some&shy;thing that&#x02BC;s good for you, and love some&shy;thing that&#x02BC;s bad for you. God knows, and you do not.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:219</sup>&#8239;They ask you a&shy;bout wine and gambling. Say, <q>In them is great sin, yet some ben&shy;e&shy;fit, but the sin is greater than the ben&shy;e&shy;fit.</q> They ask you how much they should give. Say, <q>The ex&shy;cess.</q>
    <sup>220</sup>&#8239;They ask you a&shy;bout or&shy;phans. Say, <q>Im&shy;prov&shy;ing their con&shy;di&shy;tion is best. God knows who spoils things and who im&shy;proves them. If God had wished, He could have put you in&shy;to difficul&shy;ties.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:221</sup>&#8239;Don&#x02BC;t mar&shy;ry i&shy;dol&shy;a&shy;trous wom&shy;en un&shy;til they be&shy;lieve. A slave who be&shy;lieves is bet&shy;ter than an i&shy;dol&shy;a&shy;tress, e&shy;ven if she pleases you. These in&shy;vite you to the fire.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:238</sup>&#8239;Strict&shy;ly guard your hab&shy;it of pray&shy;ers. Stand be&shy;fore God in de&shy;vout o&shy;be&shy;di&shy;ence.
    <sup>239</sup>&#8239;If you are in dan&shy;ger, pray walk&shy;ing or rid&shy;ing, but when you are se&shy;cure, re&shy;mem&shy;ber God, for He taught you what you did not know.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:256</sup>&#8239;There shall be no com&shy;pul&shy;sion in re&shy;li&shy;gion. The right path has be&shy;come clear from the wrong. Who&shy;ev&shy;er re&shy;jects false gods and be&shy;lieves in God has grasped the most trust&shy;wor&shy;thy hand&shy;hold that nev&shy;er breaks.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:261</sup>&#8239;Those who spend their wealth in God&#x02BC;s cause are like a grain of corn which grows sev&shy;en ears, and each ear has a hun&shy;dred grains.
    <sup>262</sup>&#8239;Those who spend their wealth in God&#x02BC;s cause will have their re&shy;ward with their Lord: they will have no fear, nor will they grieve.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:263</sup>&#8239;Kind words and for&shy;give&shy;ness are bet&shy;ter than char&shy;i&shy;ty fol&shy;lowed by in&shy;ju&shy;ry.
    <sup>264</sup>&#8239;Be&shy;liev&shy;ers, don&#x02BC;t can&shy;cel your char&shy;i&shy;ty with reminders of your gen&shy;er&shy;os&shy;i&shy;ty or with in&shy;ju&shy;ry, like those who spend their wealth to be seen of men, but do not be&shy;lieve in God or the Last Day. They are like a smooth rock with dust on it. Heav&shy;y rain falls, leav&shy;ing it bare. They are un&shy;a&shy;ble to keep any&shy;thing they have earned. God does not guide dis&shy;be&shy;liev&shy;ers.
    <sup>265</sup>&#8239;Those who spend their wealth seek&shy;ing to please God are like a gar&shy;den on high ground. Heav&shy;y rain falls, yield&shy;ing a dou&shy;ble har&shy;vest. If heav&shy;y rain doesn&#x02BC;t fall, light rain will.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:267</sup>&#8239;Be&shy;liev&shy;ers, give from the good things which you have earned. Do not give from what is bad, when you your&shy;selves would on&shy;ly ac&shy;cept it if your eyes were closed.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:268</sup>&#8239;Satan threat&shy;ens you with pov&shy;er&shy;ty and or&shy;ders you to com&shy;mit im&shy;mo&shy;ral&shy;i&shy;ty. God prom&shy;ises you His for&shy;give&shy;ness and boun&shy;ty.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:270</sup>&#8239;What&shy;ev&shy;er you give, or vow to give, God knows it. But the wrong&shy;do&shy;ers will have no help&shy;ers.
    <sup>271</sup>&#8239;If you dis&shy;close your char&shy;i&shy;ty, it is good, but if you con&shy;ceal it and give it to the poor, it is bet&shy;ter for you. It will a&shy;tone for some of your bad deeds.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:272</sup>&#8239;What&shy;ev&shy;er char&shy;i&shy;ty you give ben&shy;e&shy;fits your own soul when you do it on&shy;ly to seek the face of God. What&shy;ev&shy;er you give will be repaid to you in full, and you will not be wronged.
    <sup>273</sup>&#8239;Give to the poor who are whol&shy;ly occupied in God&#x02BC;s cause, un&shy;a&shy;ble to trav&shy;el in the land for work. The un&shy;know&shy;ing might think they are rich be&shy;cause of their re&shy;straint, but you will rec&shy;og&shy;nize them be&shy;cause they don&#x02BC;t beg per&shy;sist&shy;ent&shy;ly. What&shy;ev&shy;er good you give, be as&shy;sured that God knows it.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:274</sup>&#8239;Those who give of their pos&shy;ses&shy;sions by night and by day, pri&shy;vate&shy;ly and pub&shy;lic&shy;ly, will have their re&shy;ward with their Lord: they will have no fear, nor will they grieve.
    <sup>277</sup>&#8239;Those who be&shy;lieve, do good works, are stead&shy;fast in pray&shy;er, and spend in char&shy;i&shy;ty, will have their re&shy;ward with their Lord:  they will have no fear, nor will they grieve.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:282</sup>&#8239;When you con&shy;tract a debt for a spec&shy;i&shy;fied term, write it down. Let the debt&shy;or write, and not di&shy;min&shy;ish what he owes. Bring two witnesses. They must not ref&shy;use when called to tes&shy;ti&shy;fy. Do not dis&shy;dain to write down your con&shy;tract, wheth&shy;er it be small or large, a&shy;long with the time it falls due: this is more just with God, more re&shy;li&shy;a&shy;ble as ev&shy;i&shy;dence, and more like&shy;ly to pre&shy;vent doubt be&shy;tween you. If it be an im&shy;me&shy;di&shy;ate trade, there is no blame if you don&#x02BC;t write it down. Have witnesses pres&shy;ent when you trade with one an&shy;oth&shy;er.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>3:3</sup>&#8239;He sent down to you the Book with the truth, confirming what went be&shy;fore it. He sent down the Torah and the Gos&shy;pel
    <sup>4</sup>&#8239;as a guid&shy;ance for the peo&shy;ple.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>3:14</sup>&#8239;Al&shy;lur&shy;ing to men is the love of their de&shy;sires: wom&shy;en, chil&shy;dren, heap&shy;ing treas&shy;ures of gold and sil&shy;ver, fi&shy;ne hors&shy;es, cat&shy;tle, and farm&shy;land. These are pleas&shy;ures of life in this world, but with God is the best place to re&shy;turn.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>3:92</sup>&#8239;You will on&shy;ly at&shy;tain true pi&shy;e&shy;ty if you give out of what you love. What&shy;ev&shy;er you give, tru&shy;ly, God knows it.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>3:137</sup>&#8239;Sit&shy;u&shy;a&shy;tions sim&shy;i&shy;lar to yours have hap&shy;pened be&shy;fore: trav&shy;el through the earth, and see how it ended for the dis&shy;be&shy;liev&shy;ers.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>3:156</sup>&#8239;Be&shy;liev&shy;ers, don&#x02BC;t say of your broth&shy;ers who trav&shy;eled or went out to fight, <q>If they had stayed with us, they would not have died.</q> This will be&shy;come a source of re&shy;gret in your hearts.
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>4:2</sup>&#8239;Give or&shy;phans their prop&shy;er&shy;ty. Don&#x02BC;t re&shy;place their good things with your bad things, nor con&shy;sume their prop&shy;er&shy;ty to&shy;geth&shy;er with your own. Sure&shy;ly, this is a great sin.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>4:3</sup>&#8239;Mar&shy;ry wom&shy;en of your choice, two or three or four. If you fear that you will not treat them fair&shy;ly, then on&shy;ly one. That will help you a&shy;void bi&shy;as.
    <sup>4</sup>&#8239;Give the wom&shy;en their dow&shy;er gra&shy;cious&shy;ly. If they will&shy;ing&shy;ly re&shy;mit any of it to you, en&shy;joy it with a clear con&shy;science.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>4:5</sup>&#8239;Do not en&shy;trust your prop&shy;er&shy;ty to the weak-minded. God made it a means of sup&shy;port for you, but feed and clothe them with it, and speak to them with kind&shy;ness.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>4:6</sup>&#8239;Test or&shy;phans un&shy;til they reach mar&shy;riage&shy;a&shy;ble age. If they have sound judg&shy;ment, re&shy;lease their prop&shy;er&shy;ty to them. Don&#x02BC;t con&shy;sume it wastefully or hast&shy;i&shy;ly be&shy;fore they grow up. If the guard&shy;i&shy;an is wealth&shy;y, he should take no com&shy;pen&shy;sa&shy;tion. If he is poor, he should use on&shy;ly what is rea&shy;son&shy;a&shy;ble. When you re&shy;lease their prop&shy;er&shy;ty to them, bring witnesses.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>4:7</sup>&#8239;Men and wom&shy;en shall each have a share of what par&shy;ents and close rel&shy;a&shy;tives leave, wheth&shy;er the prop&shy;er&shy;ty is small or large.
    <sup>8</sup>&#8239;If oth&shy;er rel&shy;a&shy;tives, or or&shy;phans, or poor are pres&shy;ent dur&shy;ing the di&shy;vi&shy;sion, then give them some&shy;thing from the es&shy;tate, and speak to them with kind&shy;ness.
    <sup>9</sup>&#8239;Let ex&shy;ec&shy;u&shy;tors have the same fear in their minds as if they had left help&shy;less chil&shy;dren be&shy;hind. Let them fear God, and speak just&shy;ly.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>4:18</sup>&#8239;Re&shy;pent&shy;ance has no ef&shy;fect for those who con&shy;tin&shy;ue to do evil un&shy;til death con&shy;fronts them and they say, <q>Now I re&shy;pent.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>4:19</sup>&#8239;Be&shy;liev&shy;ers, you are for&shy;bid&shy;den to in&shy;her&shy;it wom&shy;en a&shy;gainst their will. Don&#x02BC;t treat your wives harsh&shy;ly. Live with them in kind&shy;ness. If you dis&shy;like them, it may be that you dis&shy;like some&shy;thing in which God has placed much good.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>4:22</sup>&#8239;Don&#x02BC;t mar&shy;ry wom&shy;en whom your fa&shy;thers mar&shy;ried,
    <sup>23</sup>&#8239;wom&shy;en who are close rel&shy;a&shy;tives, your wet nurses, your milk sis&shy;ters, your wives&#x02BC; moth&shy;ers, your step&shy;daugh&shy;ters, those whom your sons mar&shy;ried, two sis&shy;ters at the same time,
    <sup>24</sup>&#8239;and wom&shy;en al&shy;read&shy;y mar&shy;ried. All oth&shy;er wom&shy;en are law&shy;ful to you, pro&shy;vid&shy;ed that you seek them in mar&shy;riage, with dow&shy;er from your prop&shy;er&shy;ty, de&shy;sir&shy;ing mar&shy;riage not for&shy;ni&shy;ca&shy;tion.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>4:29</sup>&#8239;Be&shy;liev&shy;ers, don&#x02BC;t con&shy;sume one an&shy;oth&shy;er&#x02BC;s wealth un&shy;just&shy;ly, but let there be trade by mu&shy;tu&shy;al con&shy;sent. Don&#x02BC;t kill your&shy;selves or one an&shy;oth&shy;er, for God is mer&shy;ci&shy;ful to you.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>4:31</sup>&#8239;If you a&shy;void the great sins which you are for&shy;bid&shy;den, We will re&shy;move your mi&shy;nor sins, and ad&shy;mit you through the en&shy;trance of hon&shy;or.
    <sup>32</sup>&#8239;Don&#x02BC;t cov&shy;et what God has be&shy;stowed more free&shy;ly on some than on oth&shy;ers. Men and wom&shy;en re&shy;ceive a share of what they earn.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>4:36</sup>&#8239;Wor&shy;ship God, and join noth&shy;ing with Him. Do good to par&shy;ents, rel&shy;a&shy;tives, or&shy;phans, the poor, neigh&shy;bors, the com&shy;pan&shy;ion by your side, and trav&shy;el&shy;ers. God does not like the ar&shy;ro&shy;gant, the boast&shy;ful,
    <sup>37</sup>&#8239;the sting&shy;y; those who com&shy;mand oth&shy;ers to be sting&shy;y, hid&shy;ing the boun&shy;ty God has giv&shy;en them;
    <sup>38</sup>&#8239;those who spend their wealth to be seen by men, and don&#x02BC;t be&shy;lieve in God nor the Last Day.
    <sup>39</sup>&#8239;What harm would it do them to be&shy;lieve in God and the Last Day, and to spend out of what God has pro&shy;vid&shy;ed them?
    <sup>40</sup>&#8239;God wrongs no one in the least de&shy;gree. If there is a good deed, He dou&shy;bles it, and gives a great re&shy;ward.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>4:58</sup>&#8239;God com&shy;mands you to re&shy;turn what you&#x02BC;ve been en&shy;trusted to its right&shy;ful own&shy;er. When you judge be&shy;tween peo&shy;ple, do so with jus&shy;tice.
    <sup>59</sup>&#8239;Be&shy;liev&shy;ers, o&shy;bey God, the Mes&shy;sen&shy;ger, and those in au&shy;thor&shy;i&shy;ty a&shy;mong you.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>4:85</sup>&#8239;Who&shy;ev&shy;er in&shy;ter&shy;cedes for a good cause will share in its re&shy;ward. Who&shy;ev&shy;er in&shy;ter&shy;cedes for an evil cause will share in its bur&shy;den.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>4:86</sup>&#8239;When of&shy;fered a greet&shy;ing, re&shy;spond with a bet&shy;ter one, or at least its e&shy;qual. God takes ac&shy;count of eve&shy;ry&shy;thing.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>4:95</sup>&#8239;God pre&shy;fers the be&shy;liev&shy;ers who strive with their wealth and lives o&shy;ver those who sit &mdash; oth&shy;er than the dis&shy;a&shy;bled. Al&shy;though He has prom&shy;ised good to all of them, those who strive re&shy;ceive a greater re&shy;ward than those who sit.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>4:100</sup>&#8239;Who&shy;ev&shy;er em&shy;i&shy;grates for God&#x02BC;s cause will find on the earth a&shy;bun&shy;dance, and man&shy;y places of ref&shy;uge. If he then dies as a ref&shy;u&shy;gee, his re&shy;ward from God is cer&shy;tain.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>4:101</sup>&#8239;When you trav&shy;el, it&#x02BC;s no sin to short&shy;en your pray&shy;ers, if you fear that dis&shy;be&shy;liev&shy;ers may at&shy;tack you.
    <sup>103</sup>&#8239;When you have com&shy;plet&shy;ed the pray&shy;er, re&shy;mem&shy;ber God: stand&shy;ing, sit&shy;ting, and ly&shy;ing down. Once you are se&shy;cure, re&shy;es&shy;tab&shy;lish reg&shy;u&shy;lar pray&shy;er, for pray&shy;er is man&shy;da&shy;to&shy;ry for be&shy;liev&shy;ers at spe&shy;cif&shy;ic times.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>4:110</sup>&#8239;One who does evil or wrongs him&shy;self, but then asks God for for&shy;give&shy;ness, will find God is for&shy;giv&shy;ing and mer&shy;ci&shy;ful.
    <sup>112</sup>&#8239;But if one sins then blames an in&shy;no&shy;cent per&shy;son, he bur&shy;dens him&shy;self with a slan&shy;der and a fla&shy;grant sin.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>4:123</sup>&#8239;Any&shy;one who does wrong will be repaid ac&shy;cord&shy;ing&shy;ly and will find no pro&shy;tec&shy;tor or help&shy;er be&shy;sides God.
    <sup>124</sup>&#8239;Any be&shy;liev&shy;er, male or fe&shy;male, who does good deeds will en&shy;ter heav&shy;en, and will not re&shy;ceive the least in&shy;jus&shy;tice.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>4:129</sup>&#8239;You will nev&shy;er be a&shy;ble to treat your wives with per&shy;fect fair&shy;ness, how&shy;ev&shy;er much you may want to, but don&#x02BC;t fa&shy;vor one com&shy;plete&shy;ly so as to leave an&shy;oth&shy;er hang&shy;ing. If you make a&shy;mends and are con&shy;scious of God, He is for&shy;giv&shy;ing and mer&shy;ci&shy;ful.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>4:135</sup>&#8239;Be&shy;liev&shy;ers, stead&shy;fast&shy;ly up&shy;hold jus&shy;tice, as witnesses for God, e&shy;ven if it is a&shy;gainst your&shy;selves, your par&shy;ents, or your rel&shy;a&shy;tives. Wheth&shy;er rich or poor, God can best pro&shy;tect them both. Don&#x02BC;t fol&shy;low your own de&shy;sire, lest you swerve from jus&shy;tice. If you dis&shy;tort or ne&shy;glect jus&shy;tice, God knows what you do.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>4:140</sup>&#8239;When you hear peo&shy;ple de&shy;ny and rid&shy;i&shy;cule God&#x02BC;s mes&shy;sages, do not sit with them un&shy;til they change top&shy;ics. Oth&shy;er&shy;wise you will be&shy;come like them: God will gath&shy;er the hyp&shy;o&shy;crites and dis&shy;be&shy;liev&shy;ers in hell.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>4:142</sup>&#8239;When hyp&shy;o&shy;crites stand to pray, they stand la&shy;zi&shy;ly, to be seen of men, remembering God on&shy;ly a lit&shy;tle,

</p>

<p>
    <sup>4:148</sup>&#8239;God does not like evil to be men&shy;tioned in pub&shy;lic, ex&shy;cept by the one who was wronged. God hears and knows all.
    <sup>149</sup>&#8239;Wheth&shy;er you do good openly or pri&shy;vate&shy;ly, or par&shy;don an evil, God is for&shy;giv&shy;ing and pow&shy;er&shy;ful.

    <sup>5:48</sup>&#8239;Muhammad, We re&shy;vealed to you this Book with the truth, confirming the scrip&shy;tures that came be&shy;fore it.  To each of you, We have pre&shy;scribed a law and a clear path. Had God wanted it, He would have made you all a sin&shy;gle com&shy;mu&shy;ni&shy;ty, but He wanted to test you in what He has giv&shy;en you, so race to do good. You will all re&shy;turn to God, then He will clar&shy;i&shy;fy your dif&shy;fer&shy;ences.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>5:57</sup>&#8239;Be&shy;liev&shy;ers, don&#x02BC;t take al&shy;lies who view your re&shy;li&shy;gion with rid&shy;i&shy;cule and a&shy;muse&shy;ment.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>5:89</sup>&#8239;God will not pun&shy;ish you for your thought&shy;less oaths, on&shy;ly for your de&shy;lib&shy;er&shy;ate oaths. The a&shy;tone&shy;ment for break&shy;ing an oath is to feed ten poor peo&shy;ple as you would feed your own fam&shy;i&shy;ly, or to clothe them, or to free a slave. If you can&#x02BC;t af&shy;ford it, fast for three days. That is the a&shy;tone&shy;ment for bro&shy;ken oaths, but keep your oaths.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>5:90</sup>&#8239;Be&shy;liev&shy;ers: in&shy;tox&shy;i&shy;cants, gambling, i&shy;dol&shy;a&shy;try, and div&shy;i&shy;na&shy;tion are a&shy;bom&shy;i&shy;na&shy;tions from Satan. A&shy;void them so that you may pros&shy;per.
    <sup>91</sup>&#8239;Satan on&shy;ly wants to use in&shy;tox&shy;i&shy;cants and gambling to cause en&shy;mi&shy;ty and ha&shy;tred a&shy;mong you, and to hind&shy;er you from remembering God and pray&shy;er. So will you quit?
</p>

<p>
    <sup>5:106</sup>&#8239;Be&shy;liev&shy;ers, when mak&shy;ing be&shy;quests as death approaches you, let there be two hon&shy;est witnesses.

<p>
    <sup>6:7</sup>&#8239;Muhammad, e&shy;ven if We had sent down to you a mes&shy;sage writ&shy;ten on pa&shy;per, and the dis&shy;be&shy;liev&shy;ers had tou&shy;ched it with their hands, they would have said, <q>This is noth&shy;ing but ob&shy;vi&shy;ous mag&shy;ic!</q>
    <sup>8</sup>&#8239;They say, <q>Why was no an&shy;gel sent down to him?</q> Had We sent down an an&shy;gel, their judg&shy;ment would have come at once, with&shy;out res&shy;pite.
    <sup>9</sup>&#8239;E&shy;ven if We had sent an an&shy;gel, We would have sent him as a man, adding to their con&shy;fu&shy;sion.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>6:48</sup>&#8239;We send the mes&shy;sen&shy;gers on&shy;ly to give good news and to warn. Who&shy;ev&shy;er be&shy;lieves and re&shy;forms will have no fear, nor will they grieve.
    <sup>49</sup>&#8239;But suf&shy;fer&shy;ing af&shy;flicts those who re&shy;ject our mes&shy;sages, be&shy;cause of their de&shy;fi&shy;ant dis&shy;o&shy;be&shy;di&shy;ence.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>6:52</sup>&#8239;Don&#x02BC;t send a&shy;way those who call on their Lord morn&shy;ing and eve&shy;ning, seek&shy;ing His face. You are not ac&shy;count&shy;a&shy;ble for them, nor they for you. If you turn them a&shy;way, you be&shy;come one of the un&shy;just.
    <sup>54</sup>&#8239;Your Lord has pre&shy;scribed for Him&shy;self mer&shy;cy: if any of you does wrong out of ig&shy;no&shy;rance, but then re&shy;pents and cor&shy;rects him&shy;self, He is for&shy;giv&shy;ing and mer&shy;ci&shy;ful.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>6:70</sup>&#8239;Leave a&shy;lone those who take play and a&shy;muse&shy;ment as their re&shy;li&shy;gion, and are de&shy;ceived by the life of this world. Re&shy;mind them, lest a soul be de&shy;stroyed for what it has earned, that it will find no pro&shy;tec&shy;tor or in&shy;ter&shy;ces&shy;sor ex&shy;cept God.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>6:108</sup>&#8239;Don&#x02BC;t re&shy;vile those whom i&shy;dol&shy;a&shy;ters call up&shy;on, lest they re&shy;vile God in their spite and ig&shy;no&shy;rance. To eve&shy;ry com&shy;mu&shy;ni&shy;ty We have made its own deeds seem pleas&shy;ing. In the end they will re&shy;turn to their Lord, and He will in&shy;form them of all they did.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>6:120</sup>&#8239;A&shy;void sin, both o&shy;pen and se&shy;cret, for those who sin will be repaid for what they&#x02BC;ve done.
    <sup>121</sup>&#8239;Eat noth&shy;ing o&shy;ver which God&#x02BC;s name has not been pro&shy;nounced: that is dis&shy;o&shy;be&shy;di&shy;ence in&shy;deed.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>6:141</sup>&#8239;Don&#x02BC;t be ex&shy;ces&shy;sive, for God dis&shy;likes the waste&shy;ful.
    <sup>142</sup>&#8239;Eat what God has pro&shy;vid&shy;ed for you, wheth&shy;er it&#x02BC;s live&shy;stock for bur&shy;dens or for meat.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>6:151</sup>&#8239;Don&#x02BC;t as&shy;cribe any e&shy;quals with God. Be good to your par&shy;ents. Don&#x02BC;t kill your chil&shy;dren for fear of pov&shy;er&shy;ty &mdash; We will pro&shy;vide for you and for them. Don&#x02BC;t ap&shy;proach shame&shy;ful deeds, wheth&shy;er o&shy;pen or se&shy;cret. Don&#x02BC;t take the life that God has made sa&shy;cred, ex&shy;cept by le&shy;gal right.
    <sup>152</sup>&#8239;Don&#x02BC;t ap&shy;proach the or&shy;phan&#x02BC;s prop&shy;er&shy;ty be&shy;fore he co&shy;mes of age, ex&shy;cept to im&shy;prove it. Give full meas&shy;ure and weight with jus&shy;tice; we bur&shy;den no one with more than he can bear. When you speak, be just, e&shy;ven if it con&shy;cerns a rel&shy;a&shy;tive.
    <sup>153</sup>&#8239;This is My straight path, so fol&shy;low it. Don&#x02BC;t fol&shy;low oth&shy;er paths. They will lead you a&shy;way from His. He has com&shy;manded you to do this, so that you may be right&shy;eous.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>6:164</sup>&#8239;Eve&shy;ry soul is re&shy;spon&shy;si&shy;ble for its own ac&shy;tions, and no one bears an&shy;oth&shy;er&#x02BC;s bur&shy;den. You will all re&shy;turn to your Lord in the end, and He will clar&shy;i&shy;fy that on which you used to dif&shy;fer.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>7:3</sup>&#8239;Be&shy;liev&shy;ers, fol&shy;low the rev&shy;e&shy;la&shy;tion to you from your Lord, and fol&shy;low no mas&shy;ters oth&shy;er than Him.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>7:204</sup>&#8239;When the Qur&#x02BC;an is re&shy;cit&shy;ed, pay at&shy;ten&shy;tion and lis&shy;ten si&shy;lent&shy;ly that you may re&shy;ceive mer&shy;cy.
    <sup>205</sup>&#8239;In the morn&shy;ings and eve&shy;nings, re&shy;mem&shy;ber your Lord in&shy;ward&shy;ly, with hu&shy;mil&shy;i&shy;ty, rev&shy;er&shy;ence, and a qui&shy;et voice. Don&#x02BC;t be a&shy;mong the heed&shy;less.
    <sup>206</sup>&#8239;E&shy;ven those who are near your Lord aren&#x02BC;t too proud to wor&shy;ship Him: they glo&shy;ri&shy;fy Him, and pros&shy;trate be&shy;fore Him.
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>8:2</sup>&#8239;Be&shy;liev&shy;ers are those whose hearts trem&shy;ble with awe when God is men&shy;tioned, whose faith strength&shy;ens when His mes&shy;sages are re&shy;cit&shy;ed to them, who trust in their Lord,
    <sup>3</sup>&#8239;who are stead&shy;fast in pray&shy;er, and who give from what We have pro&shy;vid&shy;ed them.
    <sup>4</sup>&#8239;They are the true be&shy;liev&shy;ers. They have for&shy;give&shy;ness with their Lord, and gen&shy;er&shy;ous sus&shy;te&shy;nance.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>8:20</sup>&#8239;Be&shy;liev&shy;ers, o&shy;bey God and His Mes&shy;sen&shy;ger. Don&#x02BC;t turn a&shy;way from him when you are listening.
    <sup>21</sup>&#8239;Don&#x02BC;t be like those who say, <q>We have heard,</q> but don&#x02BC;t ac&shy;tu&shy;al&shy;ly lis&shy;ten.
    <sup>22</sup>&#8239;In&shy;deed, the worst crea&shy;tures in God&#x02BC;s sight are the deaf and dumb who don&#x02BC;t use rea&shy;son.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>8:47</sup>&#8239;Don&#x02BC;t be like those who came out of their homes con&shy;ceit&shy;ed, show&shy;ing off, and hindering oth&shy;ers from God&#x02BC;s path.
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>9:24</sup>&#8239;If your fa&shy;thers, your sons, your broth&shy;ers, your wives, your tribes, the wealth you have gained, the com&shy;merce you fear will de&shy;cline, and the dwell&shy;ings you love are dearer to you than God, His Mes&shy;sen&shy;ger, and strug&shy;gle in His cause, then wait un&shy;til God ex&shy;e&shy;cutes His com&shy;mand. God does not guide the re&shy;bel&shy;lious.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>9:34</sup>&#8239;Be&shy;liev&shy;ers, man&shy;y rab&shy;bis and monks false&shy;ly de&shy;vour men&#x02BC;s wealth and di&shy;vert men from God&#x02BC;s path.  Tell those who hoard gold and sil&shy;ver, with&shy;out giv&shy;ing for God&#x02BC;s cause, that they will re&shy;ceive a pain&shy;ful pun&shy;ish&shy;ment.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>9:54</sup>&#8239;On&shy;ly this pre&shy;vents a gift from be&shy;ing ac&shy;cept&shy;ed: they don&#x02BC;t be&shy;lieve God and His Mes&shy;sen&shy;ger, they come to pray&shy;er la&shy;zi&shy;ly, and they give un&shy;will&shy;ing&shy;ly.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>9:60</sup>&#8239;Alms are for the poor, the needy, those who ad&shy;min&shy;is&shy;ter the funds, those whose hearts are to be won o&shy;ver, to free slaves, to help debt&shy;ors, for God&#x02BC;s cause, and needy trav&shy;el&shy;ers.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>9:71</sup>&#8239;The be&shy;liev&shy;ers pro&shy;tect one an&shy;oth&shy;er. They en&shy;join what is right, for&shy;bid what is wrong, are stead&shy;fast in pray&shy;er, spend in char&shy;i&shy;ty, and o&shy;bey God and His Mes&shy;sen&shy;ger. God will have mer&shy;cy on them.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>9:91</sup>&#8239;There is no blame on the weak, the ill, or those with&shy;out re&shy;sources to spend, when they are sin&shy;cere to God and His Mes&shy;sen&shy;ger. There is no rea&shy;son to re&shy;proach those who do good.
    <sup>92</sup>&#8239;There is al&shy;so no blame on those who came to you for mounts, and when you said, <q>I can&#x02BC;t find a mount for you,</q> they turned back, their eyes overflowing with tears of grief that they had noth&shy;ing to spend.
    <sup>93</sup>&#8239;On&shy;ly those who re&shy;quest ex&shy;emp&shy;tion, de&shy;spite be&shy;ing rich, are o&shy;pen to blame. They are con&shy;tent to be with those who stay be&shy;hind.
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>10:11</sup>&#8239;If God were to has&shy;ten the ill that men have earned, as they wish to has&shy;ten the good, their end would al&shy;read&shy;y be here.
    <sup>12</sup>&#8239;And when trou&shy;ble touches man, he cries out to Us wheth&shy;er ly&shy;ing on his side, sit&shy;ting, or stand&shy;ing, but when We re&shy;move his trou&shy;ble, he goes on his way as if he had nev&shy;er cried out to Us.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>10:41</sup>&#8239;If they don&#x02BC;t be&shy;lieve you, say, <q>My deeds for me, and yours for you. You are not re&shy;spon&shy;si&shy;ble for what I do, nor I for what you do.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>10:47</sup>&#8239;Eve&shy;ry com&shy;mu&shy;ni&shy;ty is sent a mes&shy;sen&shy;ger. When their mes&shy;sen&shy;ger co&shy;mes, they will be judged with jus&shy;tice, and will not be wronged.
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>11:9</sup>&#8239;If We let man taste mer&shy;cy, and then with&shy;draw it, he de&shy;spairs and is un&shy;grate&shy;ful.
    <sup>10</sup>&#8239;But if We let him taste mer&shy;cy af&shy;ter ad&shy;ver&shy;si&shy;ty has tou&shy;ched him, he is sure to say, <q>Mis&shy;for&shy;tune has left me.</q> He be&shy;comes ex&shy;ult&shy;ant and boast&shy;ful.
    <sup>11</sup>&#8239;Those who are stead&shy;fast and do right&shy;eous deeds don&#x02BC;t act this way. They will have for&shy;give&shy;ness and a great re&shy;ward.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>11:112</sup>&#8239;Stay on the right path as you have been com&shy;manded, to&shy;geth&shy;er with those who have turned to God. Don&#x02BC;t trans&shy;gress, for He sees all that you do.
    <sup>113</sup>&#8239;Don&#x02BC;t in&shy;cline to&shy;ward nor re&shy;ly on those who do wrong.
    <sup>114</sup>&#8239;Be stead&shy;fast in pray&shy;er at both ends of the day and dur&shy;ing parts of the night. Good deeds drive a&shy;way evil deeds.
    <sup>115</sup>&#8239;Be stead&shy;fast: God won&#x02BC;t lose the re&shy;ward of those who do good.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>11:117</sup>&#8239;Your Lord would nev&shy;er de&shy;stroy communities un&shy;just&shy;ly if its peo&shy;ple act right&shy;eous&shy;ly.
    <sup>118</sup>&#8239;If your Lord had wanted, He could have made man&shy;kind one com&shy;mu&shy;ni&shy;ty, but they con&shy;tin&shy;ue to dif&shy;fer.

    <sup>13:4</sup>&#8239;There are neighboring plots in the land: vine&shy;yards, corn&shy;fields, and date palms. They are all wa&shy;tered with the same wa&shy;ter, yet We make some bet&shy;ter to eat than oth&shy;ers. These are signs for peo&shy;ple who rea&shy;son.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>13:11</sup>&#8239;God does not change the con&shy;di&shy;tion of a peo&shy;ple un&shy;less they change what is with&shy;in them&shy;selves.

    <sup>13:22</sup>&#8239;Those who are pa&shy;tient, seek&shy;ing their Lord&#x02BC;s face; who are stead&shy;fast in pray&shy;er; who spend se&shy;cret&shy;ly and openly from what We have pro&shy;vid&shy;ed them; and who re&shy;pel evil with good: those will have the re&shy;ward of an e&shy;ter&shy;nal home.

    <sup>29</sup>&#8239;Joy and a beau&shy;ti&shy;ful home&shy;com&shy;ing a&shy;wait those who be&shy;lieve and do right&shy;eous deeds.</q>

    <sup>15</sup>&#8239;He has placed riv&shy;ers and roads on the earth, so you may find your way;

<p>
    <sup>16:61</sup>&#8239;If God were to pun&shy;ish men for their wrong&shy;do&shy;ing, He would leave no liv&shy;ing crea&shy;ture on the earth, but He gives them res&shy;pite for an ap&shy;point&shy;ed time.

    <sup>126</sup>&#8239;If you must re&shy;spond to an at&shy;tack, re&shy;spond no worse than the at&shy;tack, but it is bet&shy;ter to show pa&shy;tience.

    <sup>17:15</sup>&#8239;Who&shy;ev&shy;er re&shy;ceives guid&shy;ance does so for his own ben&shy;e&shy;fit. Who&shy;ev&shy;er strays does so to his own det&shy;ri&shy;ment. No one will bear an&shy;oth&shy;er&#x02BC;s bur&shy;den, but We on&shy;ly pun&shy;ish af&shy;ter We have sent a mes&shy;sen&shy;ger.

    <sup>24</sup>&#8239;Say, <q>My Lord, have mer&shy;cy on them just as they reared me when I was small.</q>

    <sup>17:25</sup>&#8239;Your Lord knows what is in your hearts. If you are right&shy;eous, He for&shy;gives those who turn to Him a&shy;gain and a&shy;gain.
    <sup>26</sup>&#8239;Give what is due to rel&shy;a&shy;tives, the needy, and trav&shy;el&shy;ers; but don&#x02BC;t spend your wealth wastefully.
    <sup>27</sup>&#8239;In&shy;deed, the waste&shy;ful are broth&shy;ers of Satan, and Satan is al&shy;ways un&shy;grate&shy;ful to his Lord.
    <sup>28</sup>&#8239;E&shy;ven if you must turn a&shy;way from the needy in pur&shy;suit of mer&shy;cy from your Lord, then at least speak a kind word to them.

    <sup>17:31</sup>&#8239;Don&#x02BC;t kill your chil&shy;dren for fear of pov&shy;er&shy;ty. We will pro&shy;vide for them and for you. In&shy;deed, kill&shy;ing them is a great sin.
    <sup>32</sup>&#8239;Don&#x02BC;t go near a&shy;dul&shy;ter&shy;y, for it is shame&shy;ful and an evil path.

    <sup>35</sup>&#8239;Give full meas&shy;ure when you meas&shy;ure, and weigh with hon&shy;est scales. That is best and ad&shy;van&shy;ta&shy;geous in the end.
    <sup>36</sup>&#8239;Don&#x02BC;t con&shy;cern your&shy;self with things you know noth&shy;ing a&shy;bout: you will be ques&shy;tioned a&shy;bout hear&shy;ing, see&shy;ing, and feel&shy;ing.
    <sup>37</sup>&#8239;Don&#x02BC;t walk on the earth with ar&shy;ro&shy;gance: you can&#x02BC;t tear the earth a&shy;part, nor match the moun&shy;tains in height.
    <sup>38</sup>&#8239;Your Lord de&shy;tests all these ac&shy;tions.
    <sup>39</sup>&#8239;This is some of the wis&shy;dom your Lord has re&shy;vealed to you.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>17:53</sup>&#8239;Say what is best. Satan sows dis&shy;cord a&shy;mong My serv&shy;ants.  He is a clear en&shy;e&shy;my to man.

    <sup>17:70</sup>&#8239;We have hon&shy;ored Adam&#x02BC;s chil&shy;dren, car&shy;ried them on land and sea, giv&shy;en them good sus&shy;te&shy;nance, and fa&shy;vored them a&shy;bove much of our cre&shy;a&shy;tion.
    <sup>71</sup>&#8239;One day We will call to&shy;geth&shy;er all men a&shy;long with their lead&shy;ers. Who&shy;ev&shy;er is giv&shy;en his rec&shy;ord in his right hand will read it with pleas&shy;ure, and will not be wronged in the least.

    <sup>17:78</sup>&#8239;Es&shy;tab&shy;lish reg&shy;u&shy;lar pray&shy;er from mid&shy;day un&shy;til the dark&shy;ness of night. Re&shy;cite the Qur&#x02BC;an at dawn, for morn&shy;ing rec&shy;i&shy;ta&shy;tion is al&shy;ways wit&shy;nessed.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>17:100</sup>&#8239;If you pos&shy;sessed the treas&shy;ur&shy;ies of my Lord&#x02BC;s mer&shy;cy, you would with&shy;hold them for fear of spend&shy;ing too much: man is ev&shy;er sting&shy;y.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>17:110</sup>&#8239;Call on God, or on the Most Mer&shy;ci&shy;ful.  Which&shy;ev&shy;er name you call is the same, for the best names be&shy;long to Him.  Don&#x02BC;t pray too loud&shy;ly or too qui&shy;et&shy;ly, but seek a mid&shy;dle way.

    <sup>18:32</sup>&#8239;There were two men. We gave one of them two vine&shy;yards sur&shy;rounded by date palms with corn&shy;fields in be&shy;tween.

    <sup>35</sup>&#8239;Hav&shy;ing thus sinned a&shy;gainst him&shy;self, he went in&shy;to his gar&shy;den. He said, <q>I don&#x02BC;t think this will ev&shy;er per&shy;ish,
    <sup>36</sup>&#8239;nor that the Hour of Judg&shy;ment will ev&shy;er come.  E&shy;ven if I were brought back to my Lord, I would sure&shy;ly find some&shy;thing e&shy;ven bet&shy;ter than this.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>18:37</sup>&#8239;His friend said to him, <q>Do you dis&shy;be&shy;lieve in Him who cre&shy;at&shy;ed you?
    <sup>38</sup>&#8239;But as for me, He is God, My Lord, and I as&shy;so&shy;ci&shy;ate no part&shy;ner with Him.
    <sup>39</sup>&#8239;When you en&shy;tered your gar&shy;den, why didn&#x02BC;t you say, <q>This is God&#x02BC;s will. There is no pow&shy;er but with God.</q> Al&shy;though I have less wealth and off&shy;spring than you,
    <sup>40</sup>&#8239;my Lord may give me some&shy;thing bet&shy;ter than your gar&shy;den, or a ca&shy;lam&shy;i&shy;ty may turn your gar&shy;den in&shy;to slip&shy;per&shy;y sand,

<p>
    <sup>18:42</sup>&#8239;And thus it hap&shy;pened: his fruit was ru&shy;ined.  He re&shy;mained, wring&shy;ing his hands o&shy;ver what he had spent on it, while it col&shy;lapsed up&shy;on its trellises, say&shy;ing, <q>I wish that I had nev&shy;er as&shy;cribed part&shy;ners to my Lord.</q>

<p>
    <sup>18:45</sup>&#8239;This world&#x02BC;s life is like rain sent down from the sky. The earth&#x02BC;s veg&shy;e&shy;ta&shy;tion ab&shy;sorbs it but soon be&shy;comes dry stub&shy;ble, scat&shy;tered by the wind.

<p>
    <sup>31:14</sup>&#8239;We have com&shy;manded man to be good to his par&shy;ents. His moth&shy;er car&shy;ried him in weak&shy;ness, and it took two years to wean him. Be grate&shy;ful to Me and your par&shy;ents.
    <sup>15</sup>&#8239;But if they try to make you as&shy;so&shy;ci&shy;ate oth&shy;ers with Me, dis&shy;o&shy;bey them.

    <sup>18</sup>&#8239;Don&#x02BC;t turn a&shy;way from men in pride, nor walk ar&shy;ro&shy;gant&shy;ly through the earth, for God dis&shy;likes the ar&shy;ro&shy;gant and boast&shy;ful.

<p>
    <sup>35:45</sup>&#8239;If God im&shy;me&shy;di&shy;ate&shy;ly pun&shy;ished men for their wrong&shy;do&shy;ing, He wouldn&#x02BC;t leave a sin&shy;gle crea&shy;ture on the earth. How&shy;ev&shy;er, He de&shy;fers for a stat&shy;ed time.
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>39:7</sup>&#8239;If you are un&shy;grate&shy;ful, God has no need of you. He dis&shy;likes in&shy;grat&shy;i&shy;tude in His serv&shy;ants. If you are grate&shy;ful, He is pleased with you. No one will bear an&shy;oth&shy;er&#x02BC;s bur&shy;den. You will re&shy;turn to your Lord in the end, and He will in&shy;form you a&shy;bout what you did. He knows what is in men&#x02BC;s hearts.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>39:10</sup>&#8239;Those who do good in this world re&shy;ceive a good re&shy;ward. The pa&shy;tient will re&shy;ceive a re&shy;ward with&shy;out meas&shy;ure.

<p>
    <sup>39:49</sup>&#8239;When man suf&shy;fers, he cries out to Us, but when We fa&shy;vor him, he says, <q>I&#x02BC;ve re&shy;ceived this be&shy;cause of my own wis&shy;dom.</q> This is on&shy;ly a test, but most don&#x02BC;t know it.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>39:69</sup>&#8239;The earth will shine with the light of its Lord, the rec&shy;ord of deeds will be o&shy;pened, the proph&shy;ets and witnesses will be brought for&shy;ward, and fair judg&shy;ment pro&shy;nounced be&shy;tween them. They will not be wronged.
    <sup>70</sup>&#8239;Eve&shy;ry man will be paid in full for his ac&shy;tions.
    <sup>71</sup>&#8239;Dis&shy;be&shy;liev&shy;ers will be led to Hell in crowds.

<p>
    <sup>40:55</sup>&#8239;Be pa&shy;tient, for God&#x02BC;s prom&shy;ise is true.  Ask for&shy;give&shy;ness for your sins, and praise your Lord eve&shy;ning and morn&shy;ing.
    <sup>56</sup>&#8239;Those who dis&shy;pute God&#x02BC;s mes&shy;sages with&shy;out au&shy;thor&shy;i&shy;ty have hearts full of pride, which they will nev&shy;er sat&shy;is&shy;fy. Seek ref&shy;uge in God.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>40:61</sup>&#8239;God made the night for you, so that you may rest. He made the day to help you see. God is boun&shy;ti&shy;ful to&shy;wards men, but most men give no thanks.
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>41:33</sup>&#8239;Who speaks bet&shy;ter than one who calls men to God, does what is right, and says, <q>I sub&shy;mit to God</q>?
    <sup>34</sup>&#8239;Re&shy;pel evil with some&shy;thing bet&shy;ter, then your en&shy;e&shy;my will be&shy;come like a close friend.
    <sup>36</sup>&#8239;If whis&shy;pers from Satan stir you up, seek ref&shy;uge in God.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>41:49</sup>&#8239;Man nev&shy;er tires of asking for good things, but if evil touches him, he gives up all hope and is lost in des&shy;pair.
    <sup>50</sup>&#8239;When we let him taste mer&shy;cy af&shy;ter ad&shy;ver&shy;si&shy;ty, he is sure to say, <q>This is due to my mer&shy;it. I don&#x02BC;t think that the Hour will come, but if I am brought back to my Lord, I will re&shy;ceive the best re&shy;ward.</q>  We will in&shy;form the dis&shy;be&shy;liev&shy;ers of eve&shy;ry&shy;thing they did, and make them taste a se&shy;vere tor&shy;ment.
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>42:13</sup>&#8239;He has es&shy;tab&shy;lished the same re&shy;li&shy;gion for you that He gave to No&shy;ah, Abraham, Mo&shy;ses, and Jesus: up&shy;hold the faith, and make no fac&shy;tions there&shy;in.

</p>

<p>
    <sup>42:27</sup>&#8239;If God were to grant a&shy;bun&shy;dant pro&shy;vi&shy;sion to His serv&shy;ants, they would mis&shy;be&shy;have; but he sends down in due meas&shy;ure what He pleases. He knows His serv&shy;ants and watches o&shy;ver them.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>42:36</sup>&#8239;What you&#x02BC;ve been giv&shy;en is for tem&shy;po&shy;rar&shy;y en&shy;joy&shy;ment in this life. What is with God is bet&shy;ter and more last&shy;ing for those who be&shy;lieve and trust in their Lord;
    <sup>37</sup>&#8239;a&shy;void great sins and immoralities; for&shy;give, e&shy;ven when an&shy;gry;

</p>

<p>
    <sup>42:40</sup>&#8239;The rec&shy;om&shy;pense for harm is an e&shy;qual harm, but God re&shy;wards him who for&shy;gives and rec&shy;on&shy;ciles.
    <sup>41</sup>&#8239;There is no rea&shy;son to blame some&shy;one who de&shy;fends him&shy;self af&shy;ter be&shy;ing wronged.

<p>
    <sup>42:48</sup>&#8239;Man re&shy;joices when We let him taste Our mer&shy;cy, but he is un&shy;grate&shy;ful when his own deeds bring mis&shy;for&shy;tune.

<p>
    <sup>45:14</sup>&#8239;Tell the be&shy;liev&shy;ers to for&shy;give those who don&#x02BC;t ex&shy;pect the Days of God. He a&shy;lone will re&shy;pay peo&shy;ple for what they have earned.
    <sup>15</sup>&#8239;Who&shy;ev&shy;er does good ben&shy;e&shy;fits him&shy;self.  Who&shy;ev&shy;er does evil harms him&shy;self. You will all re&shy;turn to your Lord.

    <sup>47:2</sup>&#8239;For those who have faith, do good, and be&shy;lieve in the rev&shy;e&shy;la&shy;tion giv&shy;en to Muhammad, God will re&shy;move their mis&shy;deeds and im&shy;prove their con&shy;di&shy;tion.

    <sup>20</sup>&#8239;This life is like rain: the growth it causes de&shy;lights the till&shy;ers, but soon it with&shy;ers. You see it yel&shy;low, then dry and crum&shy;ble a&shy;way. World&shy;ly life is on&shy;ly a pleas&shy;ant il&shy;lu&shy;sion.

    <sup>11</sup>&#8239;Let Me deal with the de&shy;ni&shy;ers who live in lux&shy;u&shy;ry. Bear with them for a lit&shy;tle while.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>73:20</sup>&#8239;Re&shy;cite as much of the Qur&#x02BC;an as may be eas&shy;y for you. He knows that some of you are sick, oth&shy;ers trav&shy;el through&shy;out the land seek&shy;ing God&#x02BC;s boun&shy;ty, and oth&shy;ers fight in God&#x02BC;s cause.

    <sup>13</sup>&#8239;and chil&shy;dren by his side,

    <sup>80:1</sup>&#8239;Muhammad frowned and turned a&shy;way

    <sup>83:2</sup>&#8239;Woe to those who de&shy;mand a full meas&shy;ure for them&shy;selves
    <sup>3</sup>&#8239;but give to oth&shy;ers less than what&#x02BC;s due.
    <sup>4</sup>&#8239;Do they not think that they will be res&shy;ur&shy;rected,
    <sup>6</sup>&#8239;on a Day when all men will stand be&shy;fore the Lord of the worlds?
</p>

<p>
    <sup>83:29</sup>&#8239;Sin&shy;ners used to laugh at be&shy;liev&shy;ers,
    <sup>30</sup>&#8239;wink at each oth&shy;er when they passed by,
    <sup>31</sup>&#8239;joke a&shy;bout them when they re&shy;turned to their own peo&shy;ple,
    <sup>32</sup>&#8239;and say, <q>These peo&shy;ple are tru&shy;ly lost,</q>
    <sup>33</sup>&#8239;but they were not sent as guard&shy;i&shy;ans o&shy;ver them.

<p>
    <sup>87:8</sup>&#8239;We will make the path to&shy;wards ease eas&shy;y for you.
    <sup>9</sup>&#8239;So re&shy;mind oth&shy;ers, if a reminder will help them.
    <sup>10</sup>&#8239;Those who fear God will re&shy;ceive the reminder,
    <sup>11</sup>&#8239;but the wick&shy;ed will a&shy;void it.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>87:14</sup>&#8239;Those will pros&shy;per who pu&shy;ri&shy;fy them&shy;selves,
    <sup>15</sup>&#8239;re&shy;mem&shy;ber the name of their Lord, and pray.
    <sup>16</sup>&#8239;Yet you pre&shy;fer the life of this world
    <sup>17</sup>&#8239;e&shy;ven though the Here&shy;af&shy;ter is bet&shy;ter and more en&shy;dur&shy;ing.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>89:15</sup>&#8239;As for man, when his Lord tries him by giv&shy;ing him hon&shy;or and gifts, he says <q>My Lord has hon&shy;ored me.</q>
    <sup>16</sup>&#8239;But when He tries him by restricting his pro&shy;vi&shy;sion, he says, <q>My Lord has hu&shy;mil&shy;i&shy;at&shy;ed me.</q>

<p>
    <sup>92:4</sup>&#8239;You all strive for di&shy;verse goals.

    <sup>6</sup>&#8239;and be&shy;lieves in the best,
    <sup>7</sup>&#8239;We will smooth his path to&shy;wards ease.
    <sup>8</sup>&#8239;But for him who is sting&shy;y, con&shy;sid&shy;ers him&shy;self self-sufficient,
    <sup>9</sup>&#8239;and denies the best,
    <sup>10</sup>&#8239;We will smooth his path to&shy;wards dif&shy;fi&shy;cul&shy;ty,

<p>
    <sup>92:17</sup>&#8239;The right&shy;eous will re&shy;main far from hell.

    <sup>20</sup>&#8239;but on&shy;ly seek&shy;ing their Lord&#x02BC;s face,

<p>
    <sup>104:1</sup>&#8239;Woe to eve&shy;ry slanderer and back&shy;bit&shy;er
