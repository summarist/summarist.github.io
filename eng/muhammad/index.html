                <sup>2:2</sup>&#8239;This book is a guid­ance for those con­scious of God,
                <sup>3</sup>&#8239;who be­lieve in the un­seen, are stead­fast in pray­er, give out of what We have pro­vid­ed them,
                <sup>4</sup>&#8239;be­lieve in the rev­e­la­tion sent to you, Muhammad, and what was sent be­fore your time, and who have firm faith in the here­af­ter.
                <sup>5</sup>&#8239;They are fol­low­ing guid­ance from their Lord, and they will pros­per.
                <sup>6</sup>&#8239;As for those who dis­be­lieve, it is the same to them wheth­er you warn them or not: they wonʼt be­lieve.
            </p>
            <p>
                <sup>2:42</sup>&#8239;Donʼt mix truth with false­hood, nor know­ing­ly con­ceal the truth.
                <sup>43</sup>&#8239;Be stead­fast in pray­er, spend in char­i­ty, and bow down with those who bow down in wor­ship.
            </p>
            <p>
                <sup>2:44</sup>&#8239;Do you en­join right­eous­ness on the peo­ple and for­get to do it your­selves, e­ven though you re­cite the Scrip­ture? Have you no sense?
                <sup>45</sup>&#8239;Seek help with pa­tience and pray­er. It is dif­fi­cult in­deed, ex­cept for the hum­ble,
                <sup>46</sup>&#8239;who are cer­tain that they will meet their Lord and re­turn to Him.
            </p>
            <p>
                <sup>2:62</sup>&#8239;All who be­lieve in God and the Last Day, and do right­eous­ness, will have their re­ward with their Lord. They will have no fear, nor will they grieve.
            </p>
            <p>
                <sup>2:79</sup>&#8239;Woe to those who write a book with their own hands then say, “This is from God,” in or­der to sell it for a small price!
            </p>
            <p>
                <sup>2:111</sup>&#8239;They say, “None will en­ter Par­a­dise un­less he is a Jew or a Christian.”
                <sup>112</sup>&#8239;In fact, who­ev­er submits him­self whol­ly to God and does good will have his re­ward with his Lord.
            </p>
            <p>
                <sup>2:135</sup>&#8239;They say, “Be­come Jews or Christians, then you will be right­ly guid­ed.”
                <sup>136</sup>&#8239;Say, “We be­lieve in God, and the rev­e­la­tion giv­en to us, and to Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob, and their descendants, and the rev­e­la­tion giv­en to Mo­ses, Jesus, and the prophets from their Lord. We make no dis­tinc­tion be­tween any of them, and we sub­mit to Him.”
            </p>
            <p>
                <sup>2:153</sup>&#8239;Believers, seek help through pa­tience and pray­er. For God is with the stead­fast.
            </p>
            <p>
                <sup>2:172</sup>&#8239;Believers, eat the good things We have pro­vid­ed for you, and be grate­ful to God, if it is Him you wor­ship.
            </p>
            <p>
                <sup>2:177</sup>&#8239;Right­eous­ness is not turn­ing your faces to­wards east or west, but right­eous­ness is one who believes in God, the Last Day, the angels, the Book, and the prophets; who gives of his wealth, e­ven though he loves it, to relatives, orphans, the needy, the trav­el­er, beggars, and for free­ing slaves; who are stead­fast in pray­er, and spend in char­i­ty; who keep their promises; and are pa­tient in pov­er­ty, ad­ver­si­ty, and dur­ing bat­tle. These ones are true, and con­scious of God.
            </p>
            <p>
                <sup>2:180</sup>&#8239;When death approaches any of you and he leaves be­hind wealth, it is pre­scribed that he make a prop­er be­quest to parents and near relatives. This is a du­ty for those con­scious of God.
                <sup>181</sup>&#8239;If any­one alters the be­quest af­ter hear­ing it, the sin is on them: God hears and knows all.
                <sup>182</sup>&#8239;But if any­one fears that the tes­ta­tor made a mis­take or did wrong, and makes peace be­tween the heirs, he incurs no sin: God is for­giv­ing and mer­ci­ful.
            </p>
            <p>
                <sup>2:183</sup>&#8239;Believers, fasting is pre­scribed for you, as it was for those be­fore you, that you may be­come con­scious of God.
                <sup>184</sup>&#8239;Fast for a spe­cif­ic num­ber of days, but if you are sick or trav­el­ing, make up the days lat­er. Those who can on­ly fast with dif­fi­cul­ty may feed a poor per­son in­stead. Who­ev­er volunteers to give more, it is bet­ter for him.
                <sup>185</sup>&#8239;In the month of Ramadan the Qurʼan was revealed as a guid­ance for man­kind, as a clear sign of that guid­ance, and as judg­ment be­tween right and wrong. So who­ev­er is pres­ent dur­ing that month should fast. God wants ease for you, not hard­ship; and per­haps you will be grate­ful.
            </p>
            <p>
                <sup>2:188</sup>&#8239;Donʼt con­sume one anotherʼs prop­er­ty un­just­ly, nor use it to bribe judges, intending to con­sume some of the prop­er­ty of others sin­ful­ly and know­ing­ly.
            </p>
            <p>
                <sup>2:215</sup>&#8239;What­ev­er you spend in char­i­ty should be for parents, close relatives, orphans, the poor, and for travelers. What­ev­er good you do, God knows it well.
            </p>
            <p>
                <sup>2:216</sup>&#8239;You may dis­like some­thing thatʼs good for you, and love some­thing thatʼs bad for you. God knows, and you do not.
            </p>
            <p>
                <sup>2:219</sup>&#8239;They ask you a­bout wine and gambling. Say, “In them is great sin, yet some ben­e­fit, but the sin is greater than the ben­e­fit.” They ask you how much they should give. Say, “The ex­cess.”
                <sup>220</sup>&#8239;They ask you a­bout orphans. Say, “Im­prov­ing their con­di­tion is best. God knows who spoils things and who improves them. If God had wished, He could have put you in­to difficul­ties.”
            </p>
            <p>
                <sup>2:221</sup>&#8239;Donʼt mar­ry i­dol­a­trous wom­en un­til they be­lieve. A slave who believes is bet­ter than an i­dol­a­tress, e­ven if she pleases you. These in­vite you to the fire.
            </p>
            <p>
                <sup>2:238</sup>&#8239;Strict­ly guard your hab­it of prayers. Stand be­fore God in de­vout o­be­di­ence.
                <sup>239</sup>&#8239;If you are in dan­ger, pray walk­ing or rid­ing, but when you are se­cure, re­mem­ber God, for He taught you what you did not know.
            </p>
            <p>
                <sup>2:256</sup>&#8239;There shall be no com­pul­sion in re­li­gion. The right path has be­come clear from the wrong. Who­ev­er rejects false gods and believes in God has grasped the most trust­wor­thy hand­hold that nev­er breaks.
            </p>
            <p>
                <sup>2:261</sup>&#8239;Those who spend their wealth in Godʼs cause are like a grain of corn which grows sev­en ears, and each ear has a hun­dred grains.
                <sup>262</sup>&#8239;Those who spend their wealth in Godʼs cause will have their re­ward with their Lord: they will have no fear, nor will they grieve.
            </p>
            <p>
                <sup>2:263</sup>&#8239;Kind words and for­give­ness are bet­ter than char­i­ty followed by in­ju­ry.
                <sup>264</sup>&#8239;Believers, donʼt can­cel your char­i­ty with reminders of your gen­er­os­i­ty or with in­ju­ry, like those who spend their wealth to be seen of men, but do not be­lieve in God or the Last Day. They are like a smooth rock with dust on it. Heav­y rain falls, leav­ing it bare. They are un­a­ble to keep any­thing they have earned. God does not guide disbelievers.
                <sup>265</sup>&#8239;Those who spend their wealth seek­ing to please God are like a gar­den on high ground. Heav­y rain falls, yield­ing a dou­ble har­vest. If heav­y rain does­nʼt fall, light rain will.
            </p>
            <p>
                <sup>2:267</sup>&#8239;Believers, give from the good things which you have earned. Do not give from what is bad, when you your­selves would on­ly ac­cept it if your eyes were closed.
            </p>
            <p>
                <sup>2:268</sup>&#8239;Satan threatens you with pov­er­ty and orders you to com­mit im­mo­ral­i­ty. God promises you His for­give­ness and boun­ty.
            </p>
            <p>
                <sup>2:270</sup>&#8239;What­ev­er you give, or vow to give, God knows it. But the wrongdoers will have no helpers.
                <sup>271</sup>&#8239;If you dis­close your char­i­ty, it is good, but if you con­ceal it and give it to the poor, it is bet­ter for you. It will a­tone for some of your bad deeds.
            </p>
            <p>
                <sup>2:272</sup>&#8239;What­ev­er char­i­ty you give benefits your own soul when you do it on­ly to seek the face of God. What­ev­er you give will be repaid to you in full, and you will not be wronged.
                <sup>273</sup>&#8239;Give to the poor who are whol­ly occupied in Godʼs cause, un­a­ble to trav­el in the land for work. The un­know­ing might think they are rich be­cause of their re­straint, but you will rec­og­nize them be­cause they donʼt beg per­sist­ent­ly. What­ev­er good you give, be as­sured that God knows it.
            </p>
            <p>
                <sup>2:274</sup>&#8239;Those who give of their possessions by night and by day, pri­vate­ly and pub­lic­ly, will have their re­ward with their Lord: they will have no fear, nor will they grieve.
                <sup>277</sup>&#8239;Those who be­lieve, do good works, are stead­fast in pray­er, and spend in char­i­ty, will have their re­ward with their Lord: they will have no fear, nor will they grieve.
            </p>
            <p>
                <sup>2:282</sup>&#8239;When you con­tract a debt for a spec­i­fied term, write it down. Let the debt­or write, and not di­min­ish what he owes. Bring two witnesses. They must not ref­use when called to tes­ti­fy. Do not dis­dain to write down your con­tract, wheth­er it be small or large, a­long with the time it falls due: this is more just with God, more re­li­a­ble as ev­i­dence, and more like­ly to pre­vent doubt be­tween you. If it be an im­me­di­ate trade, there is no blame if you donʼt write it down. Have witnesses pres­ent when you trade with one an­oth­er.

                <sup>3:3</sup>&#8239;He sent down to you the Book with the truth, confirming what went be­fore it. He sent down the Torah and the Gos­pel
                <sup>4</sup>&#8239;as a guid­ance for the peo­ple.

            <p>
                <sup>3:14</sup>&#8239;Al­lur­ing to men is the love of their desires: wom­en, chil­dren, heap­ing treasures of gold and sil­ver, fi­ne hors­es, cat­tle, and farm­land. These are pleasures of life in this world, but with God is the best place to re­turn.
            </p>
            <p>
                <sup>3:92</sup>&#8239;You will on­ly at­tain true pi­e­ty if you give out of what you love. What­ev­er you give, tru­ly, God knows it.
            </p>
            <p>
                <sup>3:137</sup>&#8239;Situations sim­i­lar to yours have happened be­fore: trav­el through the earth, and see how it ended for the disbelievers.

            <p>
                <sup>3:156</sup>&#8239;Believers, donʼt say of your brothers who trav­eled or went out to fight, “If they had stayed with us, they would not have died.” This will be­come a source of re­gret in your hearts.
