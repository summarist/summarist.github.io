            <p>
                <sup>3:1</sup>&#8239;My son, donʼt for­get my teach­ing, but let your heart keep my commandments,
                <sup>2</sup>&#8239;for they will bring you man­y days, years of life, and peace.
            </p>
            <p>
                <sup>3:3</sup>&#8239;Donʼt let kind­ness and truth leave you. Tie them a­round your neck. Write them on the tab­let of your heart.
                <sup>4</sup>&#8239;Then you will find fa­vor and high re­gard in the sight of God and man.
            </p>
            <p>
                <sup>3:5</sup>&#8239;Trust in <span class="small-caps">God</span> with all your heart, and donʼt lean on your own un­der­stand­ing.
                <sup>6</sup>&#8239;In all your ways ac­knowl­edge him, and he will make your paths straight.
                <sup>7</sup>&#8239;Donʼt be wise in your own eyes. Fear <span class="small-caps">God</span>, and turn a­way from evil.
                <sup>8</sup>&#8239;It will be heal­ing to your bod­y, and re­fresh­ment to your bones.
            </p>
            <p>
                <sup>3:9</sup>&#8239;Hon­or <span class="small-caps">God</span> with your wealth, and with the first­fruits of all your pro­duce,
                <sup>10</sup>&#8239;then your barns will be filled with plen­ty, and your vats will o­ver­flow with new wine.
            </p>
            <p>
                <sup>3:11</sup>&#8239;My son, donʼt re­ject the dis­ci­pline of <span class="small-caps">God</span> or loathe his re­proof;
                <sup>12</sup>&#8239;for <span class="small-caps">God</span> reproves the one he loves, just as a fa­ther reproves the son in whom he delights.

            <p>
                <sup>3:13</sup>&#8239;Hap­py is the man who finds wis­dom, and the man who gains un­der­stand­ing.
                <sup>14</sup>&#8239;For she is more prof­it­a­ble than sil­ver, and her gain is bet­ter than fi­ne gold.
                <sup>15</sup>&#8239;She is more pre­cious than jewels, and noth­ing you de­sire compares with her.
                <sup>16</sup>&#8239;Long life is in her right hand. In her left hand are rich­es and hon­or.
                <sup>17</sup>&#8239;Her ways are pleas­ant, and all her paths are peace­ful.
                <sup>18</sup>&#8239;She is a tree of life to those who take hold of her. Those who hold her fast are hap­py.
            </p>
            <p>
                <sup>3:19</sup>&#8239;<span class="small-caps">God</span> founded the earth by wis­dom. He established the heavens by un­der­stand­ing.
                <sup>20</sup>&#8239;By his knowl­edge the depths broke o­pen, and the clouds drip with dew.
            </p>
            <p>
                <sup>3:21</sup>&#8239;My son, donʼt lose sight of them. Keep sound wis­dom and dis­cre­tion.
                <sup>22</sup>&#8239;They will be life for your soul, and a­dorn­ment for your neck.
                <sup>23</sup>&#8239;Then you will walk on your way se­cure­ly, and your foot wonʼt stum­ble.
                <sup>24</sup>&#8239;When you lie down, you wonʼt be a­fraid. When you lie down, your sleep will be sweet.
            </p>
            <p>
                <sup>3:25</sup>&#8239;Donʼt fear sud­den dis­as­ter or the ru­in of the wick­ed when it co­mes,
                <sup>26</sup>&#8239;for <span class="small-caps">God</span> will be your con­fi­dence, and will keep your foot from be­ing caught.
            </p>
            <p>
                <sup>3:27</sup>&#8239;Donʼt with­hold good from those who de­serve it, when it is in your pow­er to do it.
                <sup>28</sup>&#8239;Donʼt say to your neigh­bor, “Go, and come back. Iʼll give it to­mor­row,” when you have it with you.
                <sup>29</sup>&#8239;Donʼt plan evil a­gainst your neigh­bor, who lives trustingly be­side you.
            </p>
            <p>
                <sup>3:30</sup>&#8239;Donʼt con­tend with a man with­out cause, when he has done you no harm.
                <sup>31</sup>&#8239;Donʼt en­vy a vi­o­lent man or choose any of his ways,
                <sup>32</sup>&#8239;for the de­vi­ous are an a­bom­i­na­tion to <span class="small-caps">God</span>, but he is a friend to the up­right.
            </p>
            <p>
                <sup>3:33</sup>&#8239;The curse of <span class="small-caps">God</span> is on the house of the wick­ed, but he blesses the dwell­ing of the right­eous.
                <sup>34</sup>&#8239;He mocks the mock­ers, but shows fa­vor to the hum­ble.
                <sup>35</sup>&#8239;The wise will in­her­it hon­or, but fools get shame.

                <sup>2</sup>&#8239;For I give you sound in­struc­tion. Donʼt a­ban­don my teach­ing.
            </p>
            <p>
                <sup>4:3</sup>&#8239;When I was a son to my fa­ther, ten­der and the on­ly son in my motherʼs sight,
                <sup>4</sup>&#8239;he taught me, and said to me: “Let your heart hold on to my words. Keep my commandments and live.
                <sup>5</sup>&#8239;Get wis­dom. Get un­der­stand­ing. Donʼt for­get or turn a­way from the words of my mouth.
                <sup>6</sup>&#8239;Donʼt for­sake her, and she will guard you. Love her, and she will watch o­ver you.
                <sup>7</sup>&#8239;The be­gin­ning of wis­dom is this: Get wis­dom, and what­ev­er else you get, get un­der­stand­ing.
                <sup>8</sup>&#8239;Prize her, and she will ex­alt you. If you em­brace her, she will hon­or you.
                <sup>9</sup>&#8239;She will place on your head a gar­land of grace. She will pres­ent you with a crown of beau­ty.”

            <p>
                <sup>4:10</sup>&#8239;Lis­ten, my son, and ac­cept my sayings, and the years of your life will be man­y.
                <sup>11</sup>&#8239;I have taught you in the way of wis­dom. I have led you in up­right paths.
                <sup>12</sup>&#8239;When you walk, your steps wonʼt be hindered. When you run, you wonʼt stum­ble.
                <sup>13</sup>&#8239;Hold on to in­struc­tion. Donʼt let go. Guard her, for she is your life.
            </p>
            <p>
                <sup>4:14</sup>&#8239;Donʼt en­ter the path of the wick­ed, and donʼt walk in the way of evil men.
                <sup>15</sup>&#8239;A­void it. Donʼt trav­el on it. Turn a­way from it, and pass on.
                <sup>16</sup>&#8239;For they can­not sleep un­less they do evil. They are robbed of sleep un­less they make some­one stum­ble.
                <sup>17</sup>&#8239;For they eat the bread of wick­ed­ness, and drink the wine of vi­o­lence.
                <sup>18</sup>&#8239;But the path of the right­eous is like the light of dawn, which shines brighter and brighter un­til mid­day.
                <sup>19</sup>&#8239;The way of the wick­ed is like dark­ness. They donʼt know what makes them stum­ble.

            <p>
                <sup>4:20</sup>&#8239;My son, pay at­ten­tion to my words. Lis­ten care­ful­ly to my sayings.

                <sup>22</sup>&#8239;For they are life to those who find them, and health to their whole bod­y.
            </p>
            <p>
