    <sup>1:1</sup>&#8239;The Way that can be put in&shy;to words is not the con&shy;stant Way.
    <sup>2</sup>&#8239;The name that can be named is not the con&shy;stant name.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>1:3</sup>&#8239;The name&shy;less is the be&shy;gin&shy;ning of all things.
    <sup>4</sup>&#8239;The named is the moth&shy;er of all things.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>1:5</sup>&#8239;Thus, be&shy;ing con&shy;stant&shy;ly with&shy;out de&shy;sires is how you ob&shy;serve the se&shy;crets of all things.

    <sup>1:7</sup>&#8239;These two e&shy;merge from the same source, but they have dif&shy;fer&shy;ent names; to&shy;geth&shy;er they are called pro&shy;found.
    <sup>8</sup>&#8239;The most pro&shy;found of the pro&shy;found, the door to all se&shy;crets.

    <sup>2:1</sup>&#8239;As soon as eve&shy;ry&shy;one in the world knows beau&shy;ty as beau&shy;ty, there is al&shy;read&shy;y ug&shy;li&shy;ness.
    <sup>2</sup>&#8239;As soon as eve&shy;ry&shy;one knows good as good, there is bad.

<p>
    <sup>3:1</sup>&#8239;By not el&shy;e&shy;vat&shy;ing the wor&shy;thy, you keep the peo&shy;ple from con&shy;ten&shy;tion.
    <sup>2</sup>&#8239;By not valuing rare treas&shy;ures, you keep the peo&shy;ple from steal&shy;ing.
    <sup>3</sup>&#8239;By not displaying what is de&shy;sir&shy;a&shy;ble, you keep the peo&shy;ple from con&shy;fu&shy;sion.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>3:4</sup>&#8239;There&shy;fore a sage gov&shy;erns by clear&shy;ing the peo&shy;ple&#x02BC;s minds, but fill&shy;ing their bellies; weakening their am&shy;bi&shy;tions, but strengthening their bones.

    <sup>7:5</sup>&#8239;A sage puts him&shy;self in the back&shy;ground yet finds him&shy;self in the fore&shy;ground;
    <sup>6</sup>&#8239;puts him&shy;self out of mind yet finds him&shy;self cared for.
    <sup>7</sup>&#8239;Isn&#x02BC;t it be&shy;cause he&#x02BC;s self&shy;less that
    <sup>8</sup>&#8239;he&#x02BC;s a&shy;ble to a&shy;chieve his self-interest?

    <sup>8:1</sup>&#8239;The highest good is like wa&shy;ter.
    <sup>2</sup>&#8239;Wa&shy;ter&#x02BC;s good&shy;ness is that it ben&shy;e&shy;fits all things,
    <sup>3</sup>&#8239;yet it strives to dwell in the places that the crowd hates,
    <sup>4</sup>&#8239;there&shy;fore it co&shy;mes close to the Way.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>8:6</sup>&#8239;In a dwell&shy;ing, its good&shy;ness is lo&shy;ca&shy;tion;
    <sup>7</sup>&#8239;in a mind, depth;
    <sup>8</sup>&#8239;in giv&shy;ing, be&shy;ing like Heav&shy;en;
    <sup>9</sup>&#8239;in speak&shy;ing, sin&shy;cer&shy;i&shy;ty;
    <sup>10</sup>&#8239;in gov&shy;ern&shy;ment, or&shy;der;
    <sup>11</sup>&#8239;in han&shy;dling af&shy;fairs, a&shy;bil&shy;i&shy;ty;
    <sup>12</sup>&#8239;in ac&shy;tion, time&shy;li&shy;ness.

</p>

<p>
    <sup>9:1</sup>&#8239;If you hold and o&shy;ver&shy;fill a cup, it&#x02BC;s not as good as stop&shy;ping short.
    <sup>2</sup>&#8239;If you ham&shy;mer and oversharpen a blade, you can&#x02BC;t main&shy;tain it for long.
    <sup>3</sup>&#8239;If gold and jade fill your rooms, no one is a&shy;ble to pro&shy;tect it.
    <sup>4</sup>&#8239;If sta&shy;tus and wealth lead to ar&shy;ro&shy;gance, you bring dis&shy;as&shy;ter up&shy;on your&shy;self.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>9:5</sup>&#8239;When the work is done, with&shy;draw; this is the Way of Heav&shy;en.

    <sup>11:1</sup>&#8239;Thir&shy;ty spokes come to&shy;geth&shy;er at one hub,
    <sup>2</sup>&#8239;but it&#x02BC;s the emp&shy;ti&shy;ness in&shy;side the hub that makes it use&shy;ful to the cart.
    <sup>3</sup>&#8239;We form clay in&shy;to a pot,
    <sup>4</sup>&#8239;but it&#x02BC;s the emp&shy;ti&shy;ness in&shy;side that makes the clay pot use&shy;ful.
    <sup>5</sup>&#8239;We chis&shy;el out doors and win&shy;dows to make a room,
    <sup>6</sup>&#8239;but it&#x02BC;s the emp&shy;ti&shy;ness in&shy;side that makes the room use&shy;ful.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>11:7</sup>&#8239;There&shy;fore, what is pres&shy;ent brings ben&shy;e&shy;fit,
    <sup>8</sup>&#8239;but what is ab&shy;sent makes it use&shy;ful.
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>15:1</sup>&#8239;In an&shy;tiq&shy;ui&shy;ty, those who were good at the Way
    <sup>2</sup>&#8239;were sub&shy;tle, won&shy;der&shy;ful, mys&shy;te&shy;ri&shy;ous, pen&shy;e&shy;trat&shy;ing, and too deep to know.
    <sup>3</sup>&#8239;Be&shy;cause they can&#x02BC;t be known, we&#x02BC;re forced to de&shy;scribe their ap&shy;pear&shy;ance:
    <sup>4</sup>&#8239;Hes&shy;i&shy;tant, as if cross&shy;ing a riv&shy;er in win&shy;ter.
    <sup>5</sup>&#8239;A&shy;lert, as if fearing the neigh&shy;bors on all sides.

    <sup>10</sup>&#8239;Vast, like a val&shy;ley.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>15:11</sup>&#8239;If mud&shy;dy wa&shy;ter is still, it grad&shy;u&shy;al&shy;ly be&shy;comes clear.
    <sup>12</sup>&#8239;If some&shy;thing at rest is moved, it grad&shy;u&shy;al&shy;ly co&shy;mes to life.

<p>
    <sup>17:1</sup>&#8239;With the ver&shy;y best rul&shy;ers, those be&shy;low on&shy;ly know that the rul&shy;ers ex&shy;ist,
    <sup>2</sup>&#8239;the next best are the rul&shy;ers they love and praise,

    <sup>64:14</sup>&#8239;Peo&shy;ple u&shy;su&shy;al&shy;ly fail in their en&shy;deav&shy;ors on the verge of suc&shy;cess.
    <sup>15</sup>&#8239;There&shy;fore we say, <q>If you&#x02BC;re as care&shy;ful at the end as you are at the be&shy;gin&shy;ning,
    <sup>16</sup>&#8239;you&#x02BC;ll have no fail&shy;ure.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <sup>64:17</sup>&#8239;There&shy;fore, the sage de&shy;sires not to de&shy;sire,
    <sup>18</sup>&#8239;and doesn&#x02BC;t val&shy;ue goods that are hard to ob&shy;tain;
    <sup>19</sup>&#8239;he learns not to stud&shy;y,
    <sup>20</sup>&#8239;and re&shy;turns to what the mul&shy;ti&shy;tude has passed o&shy;ver.
    <sup>21</sup>&#8239;He could help all things to be nat&shy;u&shy;ral,
    <sup>22</sup>&#8239;but dares not do it.

<p>
    <sup>66:1</sup>&#8239;The riv&shy;ers and lakes are a&shy;ble to be the kings of the val&shy;leys
    <sup>2</sup>&#8239;be&shy;cause of their skill at be&shy;ing low.
    <sup>4</sup>&#8239;There&shy;fore, want&shy;ing to be a&shy;bove the peo&shy;ple, the sage must speak to them hum&shy;bly from be&shy;low;
    <sup>5</sup>&#8239;want&shy;ing to be be&shy;fore the peo&shy;ple, he must put him&shy;self be&shy;hind them.
    <sup>6</sup>&#8239;There&shy;fore, he dwells a&shy;bove them yet the peo&shy;ple don&#x02BC;t feel that he&#x02BC;s a bur&shy;den.
    <sup>7</sup>&#8239;He dwells be&shy;fore them yet the peo&shy;ple don&#x02BC;t feel that he&#x02BC;s an ob&shy;struc&shy;tion.
    <sup>8</sup>&#8239;Eve&shy;ry&shy;one in the world de&shy;lights in pro&shy;mot&shy;ing him and nev&shy;er tires of him.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>66:9</sup>&#8239;It&#x02BC;s be&shy;cause he doesn&#x02BC;t con&shy;tend
    <sup>10</sup>&#8239;that no one in the world can con&shy;tend with him.
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>67:4</sup>&#8239;I con&shy;stant&shy;ly have three treas&shy;ures which I hold and treas&shy;ure:
    <sup>5</sup>&#8239;the first is com&shy;pas&shy;sion,
    <sup>6</sup>&#8239;the sec&shy;ond is fru&shy;gal&shy;i&shy;ty,
    <sup>7</sup>&#8239;the third is not dar&shy;ing to be pre&shy;em&shy;i&shy;nent in the world.
    <sup>8</sup>&#8239;It&#x02BC;s be&shy;cause of com&shy;pas&shy;sion that I can be cou&shy;ra&shy;geous;
    <sup>9</sup>&#8239;it&#x02BC;s be&shy;cause of fru&shy;gal&shy;i&shy;ty that I can be gen&shy;er&shy;ous;
    <sup>10</sup>&#8239;it&#x02BC;s be&shy;cause of not dar&shy;ing to be pre&shy;em&shy;i&shy;nent in the world that I can be head of all things.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>67:11</sup>&#8239;Now, abandoning com&shy;pas&shy;sion to be cou&shy;ra&shy;geous,
    <sup>12</sup>&#8239;abandoning fru&shy;gal&shy;i&shy;ty to be gen&shy;er&shy;ous,
    <sup>13</sup>&#8239;abandoning the rear to be in front:
    <sup>14</sup>&#8239;this is courting death.

<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>68:1</sup>&#8239;A skill&shy;ful war&shy;ri&shy;or doesn&#x02BC;t show his might.
    <sup>2</sup>&#8239;A skill&shy;ful fight&shy;er doesn&#x02BC;t get an&shy;gry.
    <sup>3</sup>&#8239;A skill&shy;ful vic&shy;tor doesn&#x02BC;t en&shy;gage his en&shy;e&shy;my.
    <sup>4</sup>&#8239;A skill&shy;ful em&shy;ploy&shy;er places him&shy;self be&shy;low oth&shy;ers.
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>73:1</sup>&#8239;Those who are brave in dar&shy;ing will die;
    <sup>2</sup>&#8239;those who are brave in cau&shy;tion will live.
    <sup>3</sup>&#8239;In these two cases, one is ben&shy;e&shy;fi&shy;cial and the oth&shy;er is harm&shy;ful.
    <sup>4</sup>&#8239;Who un&shy;der&shy;stands why Heav&shy;en hates what it does?
</p>

<p>
    <sup>73:6</sup>&#8239;The Way of Heav&shy;en doesn&#x02BC;t fight yet wins skill&shy;ful&shy;ly,
    <sup>7</sup>&#8239;doesn&#x02BC;t speak yet re&shy;sponds skill&shy;ful&shy;ly,
    <sup>8</sup>&#8239;isn&#x02BC;t sum&shy;moned yet co&shy;mes on its own,
    <sup>9</sup>&#8239;is at ease yet plans skill&shy;ful&shy;ly.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>73:10</sup>&#8239;The net of Heav&shy;en is vast; it has a coarse mesh yet noth&shy;ing slips through.
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>75:1</sup>&#8239;The peo&shy;ple starve be&shy;cause those a&shy;bove con&shy;sume too much in taxes.
    <sup>2</sup>&#8239;The peo&shy;ple reb&shy;el be&shy;cause those a&shy;bove in&shy;ter&shy;fere.
    <sup>3</sup>&#8239;The peo&shy;ple scoff at death be&shy;cause those a&shy;bove de&shy;mand so much from life.
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>76:1</sup>&#8239;While liv&shy;ing, a man is sup&shy;ple and soft,
    <sup>2</sup>&#8239;but once dead, he is hard and rig&shy;id.
    <sup>3</sup>&#8239;While liv&shy;ing, all things, grasses, and trees are sup&shy;ple and crisp,
    <sup>4</sup>&#8239;but once dead, they are with&shy;ered and dry.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>76:5</sup>&#8239;There&shy;fore it is said: those who are hard and rig&shy;id are the fol&shy;low&shy;ers of death;
    <sup>6</sup>&#8239;those who are sup&shy;ple and soft are the fol&shy;low&shy;ers of life.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>76:7</sup>&#8239;There&shy;fore, a rig&shy;id ar&shy;my won&#x02BC;t win,
    <sup>8</sup>&#8239;and a rig&shy;id tree will snap.
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>77:1</sup>&#8239;The Way of Heav&shy;en is like an arch&shy;er draw&shy;ing his bow.
    <sup>2</sup>&#8239;If it&#x02BC;s too high, he presses down; if it&#x02BC;s too low, he lifts up;
    <sup>3</sup>&#8239;if there is ex&shy;cess, he re&shy;duces it;
    <sup>4</sup>&#8239;if there is not e&shy;nough, he adds to it.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>77:5</sup>&#8239;The Way of Heav&shy;en is al&shy;so to re&shy;duce what has ex&shy;cess and add to what doesn&#x02BC;t have e&shy;nough.
    <sup>6</sup>&#8239;The Way of man is dif&shy;fer&shy;ent:
    <sup>7</sup>&#8239;he re&shy;duces what doesn&#x02BC;t have e&shy;nough and of&shy;fers it to that which has ex&shy;cess.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>77:8</sup>&#8239;Who can have ex&shy;cess and of&shy;fer it to Heav&shy;en?
    <sup>9</sup>&#8239;On&shy;ly he who has the Way.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>77:10</sup>&#8239;There&shy;fore, the sage takes ac&shy;tions with&shy;out claiming the re&shy;sults;
    <sup>11</sup>&#8239;he suc&shy;ceeds with&shy;out dwell&shy;ing on it;
    <sup>12</sup>&#8239;sim&shy;i&shy;lar&shy;ly, he doesn&#x02BC;t de&shy;sire to make a dis&shy;play of his wor&shy;thi&shy;ness.
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>79:1</sup>&#8239;When har&shy;mo&shy;ny is made af&shy;ter great re&shy;sent&shy;ment,
    <sup>2</sup>&#8239;there is al&shy;ways some re&shy;sent&shy;ment remaining.
    <sup>3</sup>&#8239;How can this be con&shy;sid&shy;ered good?
    <sup>4</sup>&#8239;There&shy;fore, the sage keeps his part of the con&shy;tract, but makes no de&shy;mands on the oth&shy;er par&shy;ty.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>79:7</sup>&#8239;The Way of Heav&shy;en has no fa&shy;vor&shy;ites,
    <sup>8</sup>&#8239;it&#x02BC;s con&shy;stant&shy;ly on the side of the good man.
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>80:1</sup>&#8239;Let there be a small state with few peo&shy;ple.
    <sup>2</sup>&#8239;Let them have pow&shy;er&shy;ful tools and not use them.
    <sup>3</sup>&#8239;Let the peo&shy;ple take death se&shy;ri&shy;ous&shy;ly and not mi&shy;grate far a&shy;way.
    <sup>4</sup>&#8239;There are boats and ve&shy;hi&shy;cles but no rea&shy;son to ride them.
    <sup>5</sup>&#8239;There are ar&shy;mor and weap&shy;ons but no rea&shy;son to pa&shy;rade them.
    <sup>6</sup>&#8239;Let the peo&shy;ple keep their re&shy;cords with knot&shy;ted string a&shy;gain.
    <sup>7</sup>&#8239;Their food is sweet,
    <sup>8</sup>&#8239;their clothes are beau&shy;ti&shy;ful,
    <sup>9</sup>&#8239;their homes are se&shy;cure,
    <sup>10</sup>&#8239;and their cus&shy;toms are en&shy;joy&shy;a&shy;ble.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>80:11</sup>&#8239;Neighboring states can see each oth&shy;er,
    <sup>12</sup>&#8239;they can hear each oth&shy;er&#x02BC;s dogs and roost&shy;ers,
    <sup>13</sup>&#8239;yet the peo&shy;ple grow old and die
    <sup>14</sup>&#8239;with&shy;out any deal&shy;ings be&shy;tween each oth&shy;er.
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>81:1</sup>&#8239;Cred&shy;i&shy;ble words aren&#x02BC;t el&shy;o&shy;quent;
    <sup>2</sup>&#8239;el&shy;o&shy;quent words aren&#x02BC;t cred&shy;i&shy;ble.
    <sup>3</sup>&#8239;The skill&shy;ful aren&#x02BC;t pol&shy;y&shy;maths;
    <sup>4</sup>&#8239;those who are pol&shy;y&shy;maths aren&#x02BC;t skill&shy;ful.
    <sup>5</sup>&#8239;Those who know aren&#x02BC;t learn&shy;ed;
    <sup>6</sup>&#8239;the learn&shy;ed don&#x02BC;t know.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>81:7</sup>&#8239;The sage ac&shy;cu&shy;mu&shy;lates noth&shy;ing.
    <sup>8</sup>&#8239;The more he does for oth&shy;ers, the greater his pos&shy;ses&shy;sions.
    <sup>9</sup>&#8239;The more he gives to oth&shy;ers, the greater his a&shy;bun&shy;dance.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>81:10</sup>&#8239;There&shy;fore, the Way of Heav&shy;en is to ben&shy;e&shy;fit with&shy;out harming.
    <sup>11</sup>&#8239;The Way of the sage is to act with&shy;out contending.
