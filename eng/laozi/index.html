    <p>
    <sup>1:1</sup>&#8239;The Way that can be put in&shy;to words is not the con&shy;stant Way.
    <sup>2</sup>&#8239;The name that can be named is not the con&shy;stant name.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>1:3</sup>&#8239;The name&shy;less is the be&shy;gin&shy;ning of all things.
    <sup>4</sup>&#8239;The named is the moth&shy;er of all things.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>1:5</sup>&#8239;Thus, be&shy;ing con&shy;stant&shy;ly with&shy;out de&shy;sires is how you ob&shy;serve the se&shy;crets of all things.
    <sup>6</sup>&#8239;Be&shy;ing con&shy;stant&shy;ly with de&shy;sires is how you ob&shy;serve the man&shy;i&shy;fes&shy;ta&shy;tions of all things.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>1:7</sup>&#8239;These two e&shy;merge from the same source, but they have dif&shy;fer&shy;ent names; to&shy;geth&shy;er they are called pro&shy;found.
    <sup>8</sup>&#8239;The most pro&shy;found of the pro&shy;found, the door to all se&shy;crets.
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>2:1</sup>&#8239;As soon as eve&shy;ry&shy;one in the world knows beau&shy;ty as beau&shy;ty, there is al&shy;read&shy;y ug&shy;li&shy;ness.
    <sup>2</sup>&#8239;As soon as eve&shy;ry&shy;one knows good as good, there is bad.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:3</sup>&#8239;Be&shy;ing and non&shy;be&shy;ing pro&shy;duce each oth&shy;er;
    <sup>4</sup>&#8239;dif&shy;fi&shy;cult and eas&shy;y com&shy;plete each oth&shy;er;
    <sup>5</sup>&#8239;long and short shape each oth&shy;er;

    <sup>11</sup>&#8239;and prac&shy;tices word&shy;less teach&shy;ing.
    <sup>12</sup>&#8239;All things a&shy;rise, but he doesn&#x02BC;t start them;
    <sup>13</sup>&#8239;he acts on their be&shy;half, but doesn&#x02BC;t make them de&shy;pend&shy;ent;
    <sup>14</sup>&#8239;he suc&shy;ceeds, but doesn&#x02BC;t dwell on it.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>2:15</sup>&#8239;It&#x02BC;s on&shy;ly be&shy;cause he doesn&#x02BC;t dwell on it, that it doesn&#x02BC;t leave.

<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>3:1</sup>&#8239;By not el&shy;e&shy;vat&shy;ing the wor&shy;thy, you keep the peo&shy;ple from con&shy;ten&shy;tion.
    <sup>2</sup>&#8239;By not valuing rare treas&shy;ures, you keep the peo&shy;ple from steal&shy;ing.
    <sup>3</sup>&#8239;By not displaying what is de&shy;sir&shy;a&shy;ble, you keep the peo&shy;ple from con&shy;fu&shy;sion.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>3:4</sup>&#8239;There&shy;fore a sage gov&shy;erns by clear&shy;ing the peo&shy;ple&#x02BC;s minds, but fill&shy;ing their bellies; weakening their am&shy;bi&shy;tions, but strengthening their bones.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>3:5</sup>&#8239;He con&shy;stant&shy;ly keeps the peo&shy;ple with&shy;out cun&shy;ning and with&shy;out de&shy;sires,
    <sup>6</sup>&#8239;so that the in&shy;tel&shy;lec&shy;tu&shy;als won&#x02BC;t dare to med&shy;dle.

<p>
    <sup>7:5</sup>&#8239;A sage puts him&shy;self in the back&shy;ground yet finds him&shy;self in the fore&shy;ground;
    <sup>6</sup>&#8239;puts him&shy;self out of mind yet finds him&shy;self cared for.
    <sup>7</sup>&#8239;Isn&#x02BC;t it be&shy;cause he&#x02BC;s self&shy;less that
    <sup>8</sup>&#8239;he&#x02BC;s a&shy;ble to a&shy;chieve his self-interest?
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>8:1</sup>&#8239;The highest good is like wa&shy;ter.
    <sup>2</sup>&#8239;Wa&shy;ter&#x02BC;s good&shy;ness is that it ben&shy;e&shy;fits all things,
    <sup>3</sup>&#8239;yet it strives to dwell in the places that the crowd hates,
    <sup>4</sup>&#8239;there&shy;fore it co&shy;mes close to the Way.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>8:6</sup>&#8239;In a dwell&shy;ing, its good&shy;ness is lo&shy;ca&shy;tion;
    <sup>7</sup>&#8239;in a mind, depth;
    <sup>8</sup>&#8239;in giv&shy;ing, be&shy;ing like Heav&shy;en;
    <sup>9</sup>&#8239;in speak&shy;ing, sin&shy;cer&shy;i&shy;ty;
    <sup>10</sup>&#8239;in gov&shy;ern&shy;ment, or&shy;der;
    <sup>11</sup>&#8239;in han&shy;dling af&shy;fairs, a&shy;bil&shy;i&shy;ty;
    <sup>12</sup>&#8239;in ac&shy;tion, time&shy;li&shy;ness.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>8:13</sup>&#8239;Be&shy;cause there is no con&shy;ten&shy;tion, there is no blame.
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>9:1</sup>&#8239;If you hold and o&shy;ver&shy;fill a cup, it&#x02BC;s not as good as stop&shy;ping short.
    <sup>2</sup>&#8239;If you ham&shy;mer and oversharpen a blade, you can&#x02BC;t main&shy;tain it for long.
    <sup>3</sup>&#8239;If gold and jade fill your rooms, no one is a&shy;ble to pro&shy;tect it.
    <sup>4</sup>&#8239;If sta&shy;tus and wealth lead to ar&shy;ro&shy;gance, you bring dis&shy;as&shy;ter up&shy;on your&shy;self.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>9:5</sup>&#8239;When the work is done, with&shy;draw; this is the Way of Heav&shy;en.
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>11:1</sup>&#8239;Thir&shy;ty spokes come to&shy;geth&shy;er at one hub,
    <sup>2</sup>&#8239;but it&#x02BC;s the emp&shy;ti&shy;ness in&shy;side the hub that makes it use&shy;ful to the cart.
    <sup>3</sup>&#8239;We form clay in&shy;to a pot,
    <sup>4</sup>&#8239;but it&#x02BC;s the emp&shy;ti&shy;ness in&shy;side that makes the clay pot use&shy;ful.
    <sup>5</sup>&#8239;We chis&shy;el out doors and win&shy;dows to make a room,
    <sup>6</sup>&#8239;but it&#x02BC;s the emp&shy;ti&shy;ness in&shy;side that makes the room use&shy;ful.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>11:7</sup>&#8239;There&shy;fore, what is pres&shy;ent brings ben&shy;e&shy;fit,
    <sup>8</sup>&#8239;but what is ab&shy;sent makes it use&shy;ful.
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>15:1</sup>&#8239;In an&shy;tiq&shy;ui&shy;ty, those who were good at the Way
    <sup>2</sup>&#8239;were sub&shy;tle, won&shy;der&shy;ful, mys&shy;te&shy;ri&shy;ous, pen&shy;e&shy;trat&shy;ing, and too deep to know.
    <sup>3</sup>&#8239;Be&shy;cause they can&#x02BC;t be known, we&#x02BC;re forced to de&shy;scribe their ap&shy;pear&shy;ance:
    <sup>4</sup>&#8239;Hes&shy;i&shy;tant, as if cross&shy;ing a riv&shy;er in win&shy;ter.
    <sup>5</sup>&#8239;A&shy;lert, as if fearing the neigh&shy;bors on all sides.
    <sup>6</sup>&#8239;Sol&shy;emn, like a visiting guest.
    <sup>7</sup>&#8239;Yield&shy;ing, like ice a&shy;bout to melt.
    <sup>8</sup>&#8239;Gen&shy;u&shy;ine, like un&shy;carved wood.
    <sup>9</sup>&#8239;O&shy;paque, like mud&shy;dy wa&shy;ter.
    <sup>10</sup>&#8239;Vast, like a val&shy;ley.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>15:11</sup>&#8239;If mud&shy;dy wa&shy;ter is still, it grad&shy;u&shy;al&shy;ly be&shy;comes clear.
    <sup>12</sup>&#8239;If some&shy;thing at rest is moved, it grad&shy;u&shy;al&shy;ly co&shy;mes to life.
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>17:1</sup>&#8239;With the ver&shy;y best rul&shy;ers, those be&shy;low on&shy;ly know that the rul&shy;ers ex&shy;ist,
    <sup>2</sup>&#8239;the next best are the rul&shy;ers they love and praise,
    <sup>3</sup>&#8239;next are the rul&shy;ers they fear,
    <sup>4</sup>&#8239;and the worst are the rul&shy;ers they des&shy;pise.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>17:7</sup>&#8239;When the task is ac&shy;com&shy;plished and the work is done, all the com&shy;mon peo&shy;ple say, <q>We did it our&shy;selves.</q>
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>18:1</sup>&#8239;When the Great Way ceased to be ob&shy;served, be&shy;nev&shy;o&shy;lence and right&shy;eous&shy;ness came in&shy;to vogue.
    <sup>2</sup>&#8239;(Then) ap&shy;peared wis&shy;dom and shrewd&shy;ness, and there en&shy;sued great hy&shy;poc&shy;ri&shy;sy.
    <sup>3</sup>&#8239;When har&shy;mo&shy;ny no long&shy;er pre&shy;vailed through&shy;out the six kin&shy;ships, fil&shy;ial sons found their man&shy;i&shy;fes&shy;ta&shy;tion;
    <sup>4</sup>&#8239;when the states and clans fell in&shy;to dis&shy;or&shy;der, loy&shy;al min&shy;is&shy;ters ap&shy;peared.
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>19:1</sup>&#8239;If we could re&shy;nounce our sageness and dis&shy;card our wis&shy;dom, it would be bet&shy;ter for the peo&shy;ple a hun&shy;dred&shy;fold. If we could re&shy;nounce our be&shy;nev&shy;o&shy;lence and dis&shy;card our right&shy;eous&shy;ness, the peo&shy;ple would a&shy;gain be&shy;come fil&shy;ial and kind&shy;ly. If we could re&shy;nounce our art&shy;ful con&shy;triv&shy;ances and dis&shy;card our (scheming for) gain, there would be no thieves nor rob&shy;bers.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>19:2</sup>&#8239;Those three meth&shy;ods (of gov&shy;ern&shy;ment) Thought old&shy;en ways in el&shy;e&shy;gance did fail And made these names their want of worth to veil;  But sim&shy;ple views, and cours&shy;es plain and true Would self&shy;ish ends and man&shy;y lusts es&shy;chew.
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>22:1</sup>&#8239;The par&shy;tial be&shy;comes com&shy;plete; the crook&shy;ed, straight; the emp&shy;ty, full; the worn out, new. He whose (desires) are few gets them; he whose (desires) are man&shy;y goes a&shy;stray.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>22:2</sup>&#8239;There&shy;fore the sage holds in his em&shy;brace the one thing (of hu&shy;mil&shy;i&shy;ty), and man&shy;i&shy;fests it to all the world. He is free from self- dis&shy;play, and there&shy;fore he shines; from self-assertion, and there&shy;fore he is dis&shy;tin&shy;guished; from self-boasting, and there&shy;fore his mer&shy;it is ac&shy;knowl&shy;edged;  from self-complacency, and there&shy;fore he ac&shy;quires su&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;or&shy;i&shy;ty. It is be&shy;cause he is thus free from striving that there&shy;fore no one in the world is a&shy;ble to strive with him.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>22:3</sup>&#8239;That say&shy;ing of the an&shy;cients that &#x02BC;the par&shy;tial be&shy;comes com&shy;plete&#x02BC; was not vain&shy;ly spo&shy;ken:--all re&shy;al com&shy;ple&shy;tion is com&shy;pre&shy;hended un&shy;der it.
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>23:1</sup>&#8239;Abstaining from speech marks him who is obeying the spon&shy;ta&shy;ne&shy;i&shy;ty of his na&shy;ture. A vi&shy;o&shy;lent wind does not last for a whole morn&shy;ing; a sud&shy;den rain does not last for the whole day. To whom is it that these (two) things are ow&shy;ing? To Heav&shy;en and Earth. If Heav&shy;en and Earth can&shy;not make such (spasmodic) act&shy;ings last long, how much less can man!
</p>

<p>
    <sup>23:2</sup>&#8239;There&shy;fore when one is mak&shy;ing the Tao his busi&shy;ness, those who are al&shy;so pur&shy;su&shy;ing it, a&shy;gree with him in it, and those who are mak&shy;ing the man&shy;i&shy;fes&shy;ta&shy;tion of its course their ob&shy;ject a&shy;gree with him in that; while e&shy;ven those who are fail&shy;ing in both these things a&shy;gree with him where they fail.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>23:3</sup>&#8239;Hence, those with whom he a&shy;grees as to the Tao have the hap&shy;pi&shy;ness of attaining to it; those with whom he a&shy;grees as to its man&shy;i&shy;fes&shy;ta&shy;tion have the hap&shy;pi&shy;ness of attaining to it; and those with whom he a&shy;grees in their fail&shy;ure have al&shy;so the hap&shy;pi&shy;ness of attaining (to the Tao).  (But) when there is not faith suf&shy;fi&shy;cient (on his part), a want of faith (in him) en&shy;sues (on the part of the oth&shy;ers).
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>24:1</sup>&#8239;He who stands on his tip&shy;toes does not stand firm; he who stretches his legs does not walk (easily). (So), he who dis&shy;plays him&shy;self does not shine; he who as&shy;serts his own views is not dis&shy;tin&shy;guished; he who vaunts him&shy;self does not find his mer&shy;it ac&shy;knowl&shy;edged; he who is self- con&shy;ceit&shy;ed has no su&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;or&shy;i&shy;ty al&shy;lowed to him. Such con&shy;di&shy;tions, viewed from the stand&shy;point of the Tao, are like rem&shy;nants of food, or a tu&shy;mour on the bod&shy;y, which all dis&shy;like. Hence those who pur&shy;sue (the course) of the Tao do not a&shy;dopt and al&shy;low them.
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>27:1</sup>&#8239;The skil&shy;ful trav&shy;el&shy;ler leaves no traces of his wheels or foot&shy;steps;  the skil&shy;ful speak&shy;er says noth&shy;ing that can be found fault with or blamed;  the skil&shy;ful reck&shy;on&shy;er uses no tallies; the skil&shy;ful clos&shy;er needs no bolts or ba&shy;rs, while to o&shy;pen what he has shut will be im&shy;pos&shy;si&shy;ble;  the skil&shy;ful bind&shy;er uses no strings or knots, while to un&shy;loose what he has bound will be im&shy;pos&shy;si&shy;ble. In the same way the sage is al&shy;ways skil&shy;ful at sav&shy;ing men, and so he does not cast a&shy;way any man; he is al&shy;ways skil&shy;ful at sav&shy;ing things, and so he does not cast a&shy;way any&shy;thing.  This is called &#x02BC;Hiding the light of his pro&shy;ce&shy;dure.&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>27:2</sup>&#8239;There&shy;fore the man of skill is a mas&shy;ter (to be looked up to) by him who has not the skill; and he who has not the skill is the help&shy;er of (the rep&shy;u&shy;ta&shy;tion of) him who has the skill. If the one did not honour his mas&shy;ter, and the oth&shy;er did not re&shy;joice in his help&shy;er, an (observer), though in&shy;tel&shy;li&shy;gent, might great&shy;ly err a&shy;bout them. This is called &#x02BC;The ut&shy;most de&shy;gree of mys&shy;ter&shy;y.&#x02BC;
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>29:1</sup>&#8239;If any one should wish to get the king&shy;dom for him&shy;self, and to ef&shy;fect this by what he does, I see that he will not suc&shy;ceed. The king&shy;dom is a spir&shy;it-like thing, and can&shy;not be got by ac&shy;tive do&shy;ing. He who would so win it de&shy;stroys it; he who would hold it in his grasp loses it.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>29:2</sup>&#8239;The course and na&shy;ture of things is such that What was in front is now be&shy;hind;  What warmed a&shy;non we freez&shy;ing find.  Strength is of weak&shy;ness oft the spoil;  The store in ru&shy;ins mocks our toil. Hence the sage puts a&shy;way ex&shy;ces&shy;sive ef&shy;fort, ex&shy;trav&shy;a&shy;gance, and eas&shy;y in&shy;dul&shy;gence.
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>30:1</sup>&#8239;He who would as&shy;sist a lord of men in har&shy;mo&shy;ny with the Tao will not as&shy;sert his mas&shy;ter&shy;y in the king&shy;dom by force of arms. Such a course is sure to meet with its prop&shy;er re&shy;turn.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>30:2</sup>&#8239;Wher&shy;ev&shy;er a host is sta&shy;tioned, bri&shy;ars and thorns spring up. In the se&shy;quence of great armies there are sure to be bad years.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>30:3</sup>&#8239;A skil&shy;ful (commander) strikes a de&shy;ci&shy;sive blow, and stops. He does not dare (by con&shy;tin&shy;u&shy;ing his op&shy;er&shy;a&shy;tions) to as&shy;sert and com&shy;plete his mas&shy;ter&shy;y. He will strike the blow, but will be on his guard a&shy;gainst be&shy;ing vain or boast&shy;ful or ar&shy;ro&shy;gant in con&shy;se&shy;quence of it. He strikes it as a mat&shy;ter of ne&shy;ces&shy;si&shy;ty; he strikes it, but not from a wish for mas&shy;ter&shy;y.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>30:4</sup>&#8239;When things have at&shy;tained their strong ma&shy;tur&shy;i&shy;ty they be&shy;come old. This may be said to be not in ac&shy;cord&shy;ance with the Tao: and what is not in ac&shy;cord&shy;ance with it soon co&shy;mes to an end.

    <sup>31:1</sup>&#8239;Now arms, how&shy;ev&shy;er beau&shy;ti&shy;ful, are in&shy;stru&shy;ments of evil o&shy;men, hate&shy;ful, it may be said, to all crea&shy;tures. There&shy;fore they who have the Tao do not like to em&shy;ploy them.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>31:2</sup>&#8239;The su&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;or man or&shy;di&shy;nar&shy;i&shy;ly con&shy;sid&shy;ers the left hand the most honourable place, but in time of war the right hand. Those sharp weap&shy;ons are in&shy;stru&shy;ments of evil o&shy;men, and not the in&shy;stru&shy;ments of the su&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;or man;--he uses them on&shy;ly on the com&shy;pul&shy;sion of ne&shy;ces&shy;si&shy;ty. Calm and re&shy;pose are what he prizes; vic&shy;to&shy;ry (by force of arms) is to him un&shy;de&shy;sir&shy;a&shy;ble.  To con&shy;sid&shy;er this de&shy;sir&shy;a&shy;ble would be to de&shy;light in the slaugh&shy;ter of men; and he who de&shy;lights in the slaugh&shy;ter of men can&shy;not get his will in the king&shy;dom.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>31:3</sup>&#8239;On oc&shy;ca&shy;sions of fes&shy;tiv&shy;i&shy;ty to be on the left hand is the prized po&shy;si&shy;tion; on oc&shy;ca&shy;sions of mourn&shy;ing, the right hand. The sec&shy;ond in com&shy;mand of the ar&shy;my has his place on the left; the gen&shy;er&shy;al com&shy;mand&shy;ing in chief has his on the right;--his place, that is, is as&shy;signed to him as in the rites of mourn&shy;ing. He who has killed mul&shy;ti&shy;tudes of men should weep for them with the bitterest grief; and the vic&shy;tor in bat&shy;tle has his place (rightly) ac&shy;cord&shy;ing to those rites.
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>33:1</sup>&#8239;He who knows oth&shy;er men is dis&shy;cern&shy;ing; he who knows him&shy;self is in&shy;tel&shy;li&shy;gent.  He who o&shy;ver&shy;comes oth&shy;ers is strong; he who o&shy;ver&shy;comes him&shy;self is might&shy;y.  He who is sat&shy;is&shy;fied with his lot is rich; he who goes on act&shy;ing with en&shy;er&shy;gy has a (firm) will.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>33:2</sup>&#8239;He who does not fail in the re&shy;quire&shy;ments of his po&shy;si&shy;tion, con&shy;tin&shy;ues long; he who dies and yet does not per&shy;ish, has lon&shy;gev&shy;i&shy;ty.
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>34:1</sup>&#8239;All-pervading is the Great Tao! It may be found on the left hand and on the right.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>34:2</sup>&#8239;All things de&shy;pend on it for their pro&shy;duc&shy;tion, which it gives to them, not one re&shy;fus&shy;ing o&shy;be&shy;di&shy;ence to it. When its work is ac&shy;com&shy;plished, it does not claim the name of hav&shy;ing done it. It clothes all things as with a gar&shy;ment, and makes no as&shy;sump&shy;tion of be&shy;ing their lord;--it may be named in the smallest things. All things re&shy;turn (to their root and dis&shy;ap&shy;pear), and do not know that it is it which pre&shy;sides o&shy;ver their do&shy;ing so;--it may be named in the great&shy;est things.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>34:3</sup>&#8239;Hence the sage is a&shy;ble (in the same way) to ac&shy;com&shy;plish his great a&shy;chieve&shy;ments. It is through his not mak&shy;ing him&shy;self great that he can ac&shy;com&shy;plish them.
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>35:1</sup>&#8239;To him who holds in his hands the Great Im&shy;age (of the in&shy;vis&shy;i&shy;ble Tao), the whole world re&shy;pairs. Men re&shy;sort to him, and re&shy;ceive no hurt, but (find) rest, peace, and the feel&shy;ing of ease.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>35:2</sup>&#8239;Mu&shy;sic and dainties will make the pass&shy;ing guest stop (for a time). But though the Tao as it co&shy;mes from the mouth, seems in&shy;sip&shy;id and has no fla&shy;vour, though it seems not worth be&shy;ing looked at or lis&shy;tened to, the use of it is in&shy;ex&shy;haust&shy;i&shy;ble.
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>36:1</sup>&#8239;When one is a&shy;bout to take an in&shy;spi&shy;ra&shy;tion, he is sure to make a (previous) ex&shy;pi&shy;ra&shy;tion; when he is go&shy;ing to weak&shy;en an&shy;oth&shy;er, he will first strength&shy;en him; when he is go&shy;ing to o&shy;ver&shy;throw an&shy;oth&shy;er, he will first have raised him up; when he is go&shy;ing to de&shy;spoil an&shy;oth&shy;er, he will first have made gifts to him:--this is called &#x02BC;Hiding the light (of his pro&shy;ce&shy;dure).&#x02BC;
</p>

<p>
    <sup>36:2</sup>&#8239;The soft o&shy;ver&shy;comes the hard; and the weak the strong.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>36:3</sup>&#8239;Fish&shy;es should not be tak&shy;en from the deep; in&shy;stru&shy;ments for the prof&shy;it of a state should not be shown to the peo&shy;ple.
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>38:1</sup>&#8239;(Those who) pos&shy;sessed in highest de&shy;gree the at&shy;trib&shy;utes (of the Tao) did not (seek) to show them, and there&shy;fore they pos&shy;sessed them (in fullest meas&shy;ure). (Those who) pos&shy;sessed in a low&shy;er de&shy;gree those at&shy;trib&shy;utes (sought how) not to lose them, and there&shy;fore they did not pos&shy;sess them (in fullest meas&shy;ure).
</p>

<p>
    <sup>38:2</sup>&#8239;(Those who) pos&shy;sessed in the highest de&shy;gree those at&shy;trib&shy;utes did noth&shy;ing (with a pur&shy;pose), and had no need to do any&shy;thing. (Those who) pos&shy;sessed them in a low&shy;er de&shy;gree were (always) do&shy;ing, and had need to be so do&shy;ing.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>38:3</sup>&#8239;(Those who) pos&shy;sessed the highest be&shy;nev&shy;o&shy;lence were (always seek&shy;ing) to car&shy;ry it out, and had no need to be do&shy;ing so. (Those who) pos&shy;sessed the highest right&shy;eous&shy;ness were (always seek&shy;ing) to car&shy;ry it out, and had need to be so do&shy;ing.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>38:4</sup>&#8239;(Those who) pos&shy;sessed the highest (sense of) pro&shy;pri&shy;e&shy;ty were (always seek&shy;ing) to show it, and when men did not re&shy;spond to it, they ba&shy;red the arm and marched up to them.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>38:5</sup>&#8239;Thus it was that when the Tao was lost, its at&shy;trib&shy;utes ap&shy;peared; when its at&shy;trib&shy;utes were lost, be&shy;nev&shy;o&shy;lence ap&shy;peared; when be&shy;nev&shy;o&shy;lence was lost, right&shy;eous&shy;ness ap&shy;peared; and when right&shy;eous&shy;ness was lost, the proprieties ap&shy;peared.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>38:6</sup>&#8239;Now pro&shy;pri&shy;e&shy;ty is the at&shy;ten&shy;u&shy;at&shy;ed form of leal-heartedness and good faith, and is al&shy;so the com&shy;mence&shy;ment of dis&shy;or&shy;der; swift ap&shy;pre&shy;hen&shy;sion is (only) a flow&shy;er of the Tao, and is the be&shy;gin&shy;ning of stu&shy;pid&shy;i&shy;ty.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>38:7</sup>&#8239;Thus it is that the Great man a&shy;bides by what is sol&shy;id, and es&shy;chews what is flim&shy;sy; dwells with the fruit and not with the flow&shy;er. It is thus that he puts a&shy;way the one and makes choice of the oth&shy;er.
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>43:1</sup>&#8239;The softest thing in the world dashes a&shy;gainst and o&shy;ver&shy;comes the hardest; that which has no (substantial) ex&shy;ist&shy;ence en&shy;ters where there is no crev&shy;ice. I know here&shy;by what ad&shy;van&shy;tage be&shy;longs to do&shy;ing noth&shy;ing (with a pur&shy;pose).
</p>

<p>
    <sup>43:2</sup>&#8239;There are few in the world who at&shy;tain to the teach&shy;ing with&shy;out words, and the ad&shy;van&shy;tage arising from non-action.
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>43:1</sup>&#8239;Or fame or life, Which do you hold more dear?  Or life or wealth, To which would you ad&shy;here?  Keep life and lose those oth&shy;er things;  Keep them and lose your life:--which brings Sor&shy;row and pain more near?
</p>

<p>
    <sup>43:2</sup>&#8239;Thus we may see, Who cleaves to fame Re&shy;jects what is more great; Who loves large stores Gives up the richer state.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>43:3</sup>&#8239;Who is con&shy;tent Needs fear no shame.  Who knows to stop In&shy;curs no blame.  From dan&shy;ger free Long live shall he.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>43:1</sup>&#8239;Who thinks his great a&shy;chieve&shy;ments poor Shall find his vig&shy;our long en&shy;dure.  Of great&shy;est ful&shy;ness, deemed a void, Ex&shy;haus&shy;tion ne&#x02BC;er shall stem the tide.  Do thou what&#x02BC;s straight still crook&shy;ed deem; Thy great&shy;est art still stu&shy;pid seem, And el&shy;o&shy;quence a stammering scream.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>43:2</sup>&#8239;Con&shy;stant ac&shy;tion o&shy;ver&shy;comes cold; be&shy;ing still o&shy;ver&shy;comes heat. Pu&shy;ri&shy;ty and stillness give the cor&shy;rect law to all un&shy;der heav&shy;en.
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>46:1</sup>&#8239;When the Tao pre&shy;vails in the world, they send back their swift hors&shy;es to (draw) the dung-carts. When the Tao is dis&shy;re&shy;garded in the world, the war-horses breed in the bor&shy;der lands.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>46:2</sup>&#8239;There is no guilt greater than to sanc&shy;tion am&shy;bi&shy;tion; no ca&shy;lam&shy;i&shy;ty greater than to be dis&shy;con&shy;tent&shy;ed with one&#x02BC;s lot; no fault greater than the wish to be get&shy;ting. There&shy;fore the suf&shy;fi&shy;cien&shy;cy of con&shy;tent&shy;ment is an en&shy;dur&shy;ing and un&shy;chang&shy;ing suf&shy;fi&shy;cien&shy;cy.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>47:1</sup>&#8239;With&shy;out go&shy;ing out&shy;side his door, one un&shy;der&shy;stands (all that takes place) un&shy;der the sky; with&shy;out looking out from his win&shy;dow, one sees the Tao of Heav&shy;en. The far&shy;ther that one goes out (from him&shy;self), the less he knows.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>47:2</sup>&#8239;There&shy;fore the sages got their knowl&shy;edge with&shy;out trav&shy;el&shy;ling; gave their (right) names to things with&shy;out see&shy;ing them; and ac&shy;com&shy;plished their ends with&shy;out any pur&shy;pose of do&shy;ing so.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>48:1</sup>&#8239;He who de&shy;votes him&shy;self to learn&shy;ing (seeks) from day to day to in&shy;crease (his knowl&shy;edge); he who de&shy;votes him&shy;self to the Tao (seeks) from day to day to di&shy;min&shy;ish (his do&shy;ing).
</p>

<p>
    <sup>48:2</sup>&#8239;He diminishes it and a&shy;gain diminishes it, till he ar&shy;rives at do&shy;ing noth&shy;ing (on pur&shy;pose). Hav&shy;ing ar&shy;rived at this point of non-action, there is noth&shy;ing which he does not do.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>48:3</sup>&#8239;He who gets as his own all un&shy;der heav&shy;en does so by giv&shy;ing him&shy;self no trou&shy;ble (with that end). If one take trou&shy;ble (with that end), he is not e&shy;qual to get&shy;ting as his own all un&shy;der heav&shy;en.
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>49:1</sup>&#8239;The sage has no in&shy;var&shy;i&shy;a&shy;ble mind of his own; he makes the mind of the peo&shy;ple his mind.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>49:2</sup>&#8239;To those who are good (to me), I am good; and to those who are not good (to me), I am al&shy;so good;--and thus (all) get to be good. To those who are sin&shy;cere (with me), I am sin&shy;cere; and to those who are not sin&shy;cere (with me), I am al&shy;so sin&shy;cere;--and thus (all) get to be sin&shy;cere.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>49:3</sup>&#8239;The sage has in the world an ap&shy;pear&shy;ance of in&shy;de&shy;ci&shy;sion, and keeps his mind in a state of in&shy;dif&shy;fer&shy;ence to all. The peo&shy;ple all keep their eyes and ears di&shy;rect&shy;ed to him, and he deals with them all as his chil&shy;dren.

    <sup>62:1</sup>&#8239;Tao has of all things the most honoured place.  No treas&shy;ures give good men so rich a grace;  Bad men it guards, and doth their ill ef&shy;face.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>62:2</sup>&#8239;(Its) ad&shy;mi&shy;ra&shy;ble words can pur&shy;chase honour; (its) ad&shy;mi&shy;ra&shy;ble deeds can raise their per&shy;form&shy;er a&shy;bove oth&shy;ers. E&shy;ven men who are not good are not a&shy;ban&shy;doned by it.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>62:3</sup>&#8239;There&shy;fore when the sov&shy;er&shy;eign occupies his place as the Son of Heav&shy;en, and he has ap&shy;point&shy;ed his three du&shy;cal min&shy;is&shy;ters, though (a prince) were to send in a round sym&shy;bol-of-rank large e&shy;nough to fill both the hands, and that as the pre&shy;cur&shy;sor of the team of hors&shy;es (in the court-yard), such an of&shy;fer&shy;ing would not be e&shy;qual to (a les&shy;son of) this Tao, which one might pres&shy;ent on his knees.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>62:4</sup>&#8239;Why was it that the an&shy;cients prized this Tao so much? Was it not be&shy;cause it could be got by seek&shy;ing for it, and the guilt&shy;y could es&shy;cape (from the stain of their guilt) by it? This is the rea&shy;son why all un&shy;der heav&shy;en con&shy;sid&shy;er it the most val&shy;u&shy;a&shy;ble thing.
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>63:1</sup>&#8239;(It is the way of the Tao) to act with&shy;out (thinking of) act&shy;ing; to con&shy;duct af&shy;fairs with&shy;out (feeling the) trou&shy;ble of them; to taste with&shy;out dis&shy;cern&shy;ing any fla&shy;vour; to con&shy;sid&shy;er what is small as great, and a few as man&shy;y; and to rec&shy;om&shy;pense in&shy;ju&shy;ry with kind&shy;ness.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>63:2</sup>&#8239;(The mas&shy;ter of it) an&shy;tic&shy;i&shy;pates things that are dif&shy;fi&shy;cult while they are eas&shy;y, and does things that would be&shy;come great while they are small. All dif&shy;fi&shy;cult things in the world are sure to a&shy;rise from a pre&shy;vi&shy;ous state in which they were eas&shy;y, and all great things from one in which they were small. There&shy;fore the sage, while he nev&shy;er does what is great, is a&shy;ble on that ac&shy;count to ac&shy;com&shy;plish the great&shy;est things.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>63:3</sup>&#8239;He who light&shy;ly prom&shy;ises is sure to keep but lit&shy;tle faith; he who is con&shy;tin&shy;u&shy;al&shy;ly think&shy;ing things eas&shy;y is sure to find them dif&shy;fi&shy;cult.  There&shy;fore the sage sees dif&shy;fi&shy;cul&shy;ty e&shy;ven in what seems eas&shy;y, and so nev&shy;er has any difficul&shy;ties.
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>64:1</sup>&#8239;That which is at rest is eas&shy;i&shy;ly kept hold of; be&shy;fore a thing has giv&shy;en in&shy;di&shy;ca&shy;tions of its pres&shy;ence, it is eas&shy;y to take meas&shy;ures a&shy;gainst it; that which is brit&shy;tle is eas&shy;i&shy;ly bro&shy;ken; that which is ver&shy;y small is eas&shy;i&shy;ly dis&shy;persed. Ac&shy;tion should be tak&shy;en be&shy;fore a thing has made its ap&shy;pear&shy;ance; or&shy;der should be secured be&shy;fore dis&shy;or&shy;der has be&shy;gun.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>64:2</sup>&#8239;The tree which fills the arms grew from the ti&shy;ni&shy;est sprout; the tow&shy;er of nine sto&shy;reys rose from a (small) heap of earth; the jour&shy;ney of a thou&shy;sand li com&shy;menced with a sin&shy;gle step.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>64:3</sup>&#8239;He who acts (with an ul&shy;te&shy;ri&shy;or pur&shy;pose) does harm; he who takes hold of a thing (in the same way) loses his hold. The sage does not act (so), and there&shy;fore does no harm; he does not lay hold (so), and there&shy;fore does not lose his bold. (But) peo&shy;ple in their con&shy;duct of af&shy;fairs are con&shy;stant&shy;ly ruining them when they are on the eve of suc&shy;cess.  If they were care&shy;ful at the end, as (they should be) at the be&shy;gin&shy;ning, they would not so ru&shy;in them.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>64:4</sup>&#8239;There&shy;fore the sage de&shy;sires what (other men) do not de&shy;sire, and does not prize things dif&shy;fi&shy;cult to get; he learns what (other men) do not learn, and turns back to what the mul&shy;ti&shy;tude of men have passed by. Thus he helps the nat&shy;u&shy;ral de&shy;vel&shy;op&shy;ment of all things, and does not dare to act (with an ul&shy;te&shy;ri&shy;or pur&shy;pose of his own).
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>66:1</sup>&#8239;That where&shy;by the riv&shy;ers and seas are a&shy;ble to re&shy;ceive the hom&shy;age and trib&shy;ute of all the val&shy;ley streams, is their skill in be&shy;ing low&shy;er than they;--it is thus that they are the kings of them all. So it is that the sage (ruler), wishing to be a&shy;bove men, puts him&shy;self by his words be&shy;low them, and, wishing to be be&shy;fore them, places his per&shy;son be&shy;hind them.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>66:2</sup>&#8239;In this way though he has his place a&shy;bove them, men do not feel his weight, nor though he has his place be&shy;fore them, do they feel it an in&shy;ju&shy;ry to them.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>66:3</sup>&#8239;There&shy;fore all in the world de&shy;light to ex&shy;alt him and do not wea&shy;ry of him. Be&shy;cause he does not strive, no one finds it pos&shy;si&shy;ble to strive with him.
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>67:1</sup>&#8239;All the world says that, while my Tao is great, it yet ap&shy;pears to be in&shy;fe&shy;ri&shy;or (to oth&shy;er sys&shy;tems of teach&shy;ing).  Now it is just its great&shy;ness that makes it seem to be in&shy;fe&shy;ri&shy;or. If it were like any oth&shy;er (system), for long would its smallness have been known!
</p>

<p>
    <sup>67:2</sup>&#8239;But I have three pre&shy;cious things which I prize and hold fast. The first is gen&shy;tle&shy;ness; the sec&shy;ond is e&shy;con&shy;o&shy;my; and the third is shrink&shy;ing from tak&shy;ing prec&shy;e&shy;dence of oth&shy;ers.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>67:3</sup>&#8239;With that gen&shy;tle&shy;ness I can be bold; with that e&shy;con&shy;o&shy;my I can be lib&shy;er&shy;al; shrink&shy;ing from tak&shy;ing prec&shy;e&shy;dence of oth&shy;ers, I can be&shy;come a ves&shy;sel of the highest honour. Now-a-days they give up gen&shy;tle&shy;ness and are all for be&shy;ing bold; e&shy;con&shy;o&shy;my, and are all for be&shy;ing lib&shy;er&shy;al;  the hind&shy;most place, and seek on&shy;ly to be fore&shy;most;--(of all which the end is) death.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>67:4</sup>&#8239;Gen&shy;tle&shy;ness is sure to be vic&shy;to&shy;ri&shy;ous e&shy;ven in bat&shy;tle, and firm&shy;ly to main&shy;tain its ground. Heav&shy;en will save its pos&shy;ses&shy;sor, by his (very) gen&shy;tle&shy;ness pro&shy;tect&shy;ing him.
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>68:1</sup>&#8239;He who in (Tao&#x02BC;s) wars has skill As&shy;sumes no mar&shy;tial port;  He who fights with most good will To rage makes no re&shy;sort.  He who vanquishes yet still Keeps from his foes a&shy;part;  He whose hests men most ful&shy;fil Yet hum&shy;bly pli&shy;es his art.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>68:2</sup>&#8239;Thus we say, &#x02BC;He ne&#x02BC;er con&shy;tends, And there&shy;in is his might.&#x02BC;  Thus we say, &#x02BC;Men&#x02BC;s wills he bends, That they with him u&shy;nite.&#x02BC;  Thus we say, &#x02BC;Like Heav&shy;en&#x02BC;s his ends, No sage of old more bright.&#x02BC;
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>71:1</sup>&#8239;To know and yet (think) we do not know is the highest (attainment);  not to know (and yet think) we do know is a dis&shy;ease.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>71:2</sup>&#8239;It is simp&shy;ly by be&shy;ing pained at (the thought of) hav&shy;ing this dis&shy;ease that we are pre&shy;served from it. The sage has not the dis&shy;ease. He knows the pain that would be in&shy;sep&shy;a&shy;ra&shy;ble from it, and there&shy;fore he does not have it.
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>72:1</sup>&#8239;When the peo&shy;ple do not fear what they ought to fear, that which is their great dread will come on them.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>72:2</sup>&#8239;Let them not thought&shy;less&shy;ly in&shy;dulge them&shy;selves in their or&shy;di&shy;nar&shy;y life; let them not act as if wea&shy;ry of what that life de&shy;pends on.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>72:3</sup>&#8239;It is by avoiding such in&shy;dul&shy;gence that such wea&shy;ri&shy;ness does not a&shy;rise.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>72:4</sup>&#8239;There&shy;fore the sage knows (these things) of him&shy;self, but does not pa&shy;rade (his knowl&shy;edge); loves, but does not (appear to set a) val&shy;ue on, him&shy;self. And thus he puts the lat&shy;ter al&shy;ter&shy;na&shy;tive a&shy;way and makes choice of the form&shy;er.
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>73:1</sup>&#8239;He whose bold&shy;ness ap&shy;pears in his dar&shy;ing (to do wrong, in de&shy;fi&shy;ance of the laws) is put to death; he whose bold&shy;ness ap&shy;pears in his not dar&shy;ing (to do so) lives on. Of these two cases the one ap&shy;pears to be ad&shy;van&shy;ta&shy;geous, and the oth&shy;er to be in&shy;ju&shy;ri&shy;ous. But
</p>

<p>
    <sup>73:2</sup>&#8239;When Heav&shy;en&#x02BC;s an&shy;ger smites a man, Who the cause shall tru&shy;ly scan? On this ac&shy;count the sage feels a dif&shy;fi&shy;cul&shy;ty (as to what to do in the form&shy;er case).
</p>

<p>
    <sup>73:3</sup>&#8239;It is the way of Heav&shy;en not to strive, and yet it skil&shy;ful&shy;ly o&shy;ver&shy;comes;  not to speak, and yet it is skil&shy;ful in (obtaining a re&shy;ply); does not call, and yet men come to it of them&shy;selves. Its dem&shy;on&shy;stra&shy;tions are qui&shy;et, and yet its plans are skil&shy;ful and ef&shy;fec&shy;tive. The meshes of the net of Heav&shy;en are large; far a&shy;part, but let&shy;ting noth&shy;ing es&shy;cape.
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>75:1</sup>&#8239;The peo&shy;ple suf&shy;fer from fam&shy;ine be&shy;cause of the mul&shy;ti&shy;tude of taxes con&shy;sumed by their su&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;ors. It is through this that they suf&shy;fer fam&shy;ine.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>75:2</sup>&#8239;The peo&shy;ple are dif&shy;fi&shy;cult to gov&shy;ern be&shy;cause of the (excessive) a&shy;gen&shy;cy of their su&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;ors (in governing them). It is through this that they are dif&shy;fi&shy;cult to gov&shy;ern.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>75:3</sup>&#8239;The peo&shy;ple make light of dy&shy;ing be&shy;cause of the great&shy;ness of their la&shy;bours in seek&shy;ing for the means of liv&shy;ing. It is this which makes them think light of dy&shy;ing. Thus it is that to leave the sub&shy;ject of liv&shy;ing al&shy;to&shy;geth&shy;er out of view is bet&shy;ter than to set a high val&shy;ue on it.
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>76:1</sup>&#8239;Man at his birth is sup&shy;ple and weak; at his death, firm and strong.  (So it is with) all things. Trees and plants, in their ear&shy;ly growth, are soft and brit&shy;tle; at their death, dry and with&shy;ered.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>76:2</sup>&#8239;Thus it is that firm&shy;ness and strength are the con&shy;com&shy;i&shy;tants of death;  soft&shy;ness and weak&shy;ness, the con&shy;com&shy;i&shy;tants of life.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>76:3</sup>&#8239;Hence he who (relies on) the strength of his forces does not con&shy;quer;  and a tree which is strong will fill the out-stretched arms, (and there&shy;by in&shy;vites the fell&shy;er.)
</p>

<p>
    <sup>76:4</sup>&#8239;There&shy;fore the place of what is firm and strong is be&shy;low, and that of what is soft and weak is a&shy;bove.
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>77:1</sup>&#8239;May not the Way (or Tao) of Heav&shy;en be com&shy;pared to the (method of) bend&shy;ing a bow? The (part of the bow) which was high is brought low, and what was low is raised up. (So Heav&shy;en) diminishes where there is su&shy;per&shy;a&shy;bun&shy;dance, and sup&shy;ple&shy;ments where there is de&shy;fi&shy;cien&shy;cy.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>77:2</sup>&#8239;It is the Way of Heav&shy;en to di&shy;min&shy;ish su&shy;per&shy;a&shy;bun&shy;dance, and to sup&shy;ple&shy;ment de&shy;fi&shy;cien&shy;cy. It is not so with the way of man. He takes a&shy;way from those who have not e&shy;nough to add to his own su&shy;per&shy;a&shy;bun&shy;dance.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>77:3</sup>&#8239;Who can take his own su&shy;per&shy;a&shy;bun&shy;dance and there&shy;with serve all un&shy;der heav&shy;en? On&shy;ly he who is in pos&shy;ses&shy;sion of the Tao!
</p>

<p>
    <sup>77:4</sup>&#8239;There&shy;fore the (ruling) sage acts with&shy;out claiming the re&shy;sults as his; he a&shy;chieves his mer&shy;it and does not rest (arrogantly) in it:--he does not wish to dis&shy;play his su&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;or&shy;i&shy;ty.
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>79:1</sup>&#8239;When a reconciliation is ef&shy;fected (between two parties) af&shy;ter a great an&shy;i&shy;mos&shy;i&shy;ty, there is sure to be a grudge remaining (in the mind of the one who was wrong). And how can this be ben&shy;e&shy;fi&shy;cial (to the oth&shy;er)?
</p>

<p>
    <sup>79:2</sup>&#8239;There&shy;fore (to guard a&shy;gainst this), the sage keeps the left-hand por&shy;tion of the rec&shy;ord of the en&shy;gage&shy;ment, and does not in&shy;sist on the (speedy) ful&shy;fil&shy;ment of it by the oth&shy;er par&shy;ty. (So), he who has the at&shy;trib&shy;utes (of the Tao) re&shy;gards (only) the con&shy;di&shy;tions of the en&shy;gage&shy;ment, while he who has not those at&shy;trib&shy;utes re&shy;gards on&shy;ly the con&shy;di&shy;tions fa&shy;vour&shy;a&shy;ble to him&shy;self.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>79:3</sup>&#8239;In the Way of Heav&shy;en, there is no par&shy;tial&shy;i&shy;ty of love; it is al&shy;ways on the side of the good man.
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>80:1</sup>&#8239;In a lit&shy;tle state with a small pop&shy;u&shy;la&shy;tion, I would so or&shy;der it, that, though there were in&shy;di&shy;vid&shy;u&shy;als with the abilities of ten or a hun&shy;dred men, there should be no em&shy;ploy&shy;ment of them; I would make the peo&shy;ple, while looking on death as a griev&shy;ous thing, yet not re&shy;move else&shy;where (to a&shy;void it).
</p>

<p>
    <sup>80:2</sup>&#8239;Though they had boats and car&shy;riages, they should have no oc&shy;ca&shy;sion to ride in them; though they had buff coats and sharp weap&shy;ons, they should have no oc&shy;ca&shy;sion to don or use them.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>80:3</sup>&#8239;I would make the peo&shy;ple re&shy;turn to the use of knot&shy;ted cords (instead of the writ&shy;ten char&shy;ac&shy;ters).
</p>

<p>
    <sup>80:4</sup>&#8239;They should think their (coarse) food sweet; their (plain) clothes beau&shy;ti&shy;ful; their (poor) dwell&shy;ings places of rest; and their com&shy;mon (simple) ways sources of en&shy;joy&shy;ment.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>80:5</sup>&#8239;There should be a neigh&shy;bour&shy;ing state with&shy;in sight, and the voices of the fowls and dogs should be heard all the way from it to us, but I would make the peo&shy;ple to old age, e&shy;ven to death, not have any in&shy;ter&shy;course with it.
</p>


<div class="scene"></div>

<p>
    <sup>81:1</sup>&#8239;Sin&shy;cere words are not fi&shy;ne; fi&shy;ne words are not sin&shy;cere. Those who are skilled (in the Tao) do not dis&shy;pute (about it); the dis&shy;pu&shy;ta&shy;tious are not skilled in it. Those who know (the Tao) are not ex&shy;ten&shy;sive&shy;ly learn&shy;ed; the ex&shy;ten&shy;sive&shy;ly learn&shy;ed do not know it.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>81:2</sup>&#8239;The sage does not ac&shy;cu&shy;mu&shy;late (for him&shy;self). The more that he ex&shy;pends for oth&shy;ers, the more does he pos&shy;sess of his own; the more that he gives to oth&shy;ers, the more does he have him&shy;self.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>81:3</sup>&#8239;With all the sharp&shy;ness of the Way of Heav&shy;en, it in&shy;jures not; with all the do&shy;ing in the way of the sage he does not strive.
