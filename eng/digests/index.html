    <sup>9:5</sup>&#8239;An&shy;oth&shy;er man de&shy;cid&shy;ed to climb the same moun&shy;tain.

    <sup>10:1</sup>&#8239;A man no&shy;ticed jig&shy;saw puz&shy;zle pieces rest&shy;ing on a ta&shy;ble.
    <sup>2</sup>&#8239;He wanted to as&shy;sem&shy;ble the puz&shy;zle but pieces were mis&shy;sing, and he didn&#x02BC;t know how the puz&shy;zle should look when fin&shy;ished.
</p>

<p>
    <sup>10:3</sup>&#8239;From time to time he lo&shy;cat&shy;ed mis&shy;sing pieces, but there were still too few to guess how the puz&shy;zle should look.
    <sup>4</sup>&#8239;One day he found a sketch of the fin&shy;ished puz&shy;zle.
    <sup>5</sup>&#8239;He as&shy;sem&shy;bled the pieces he had, on&shy;ly to re&shy;al&shy;ize that he was still mis&shy;sing some.
    <sup>6</sup>&#8239;He con&shy;tin&shy;ued search&shy;ing for mis&shy;sing pieces, plac&shy;ing them where they be&shy;longed.
    <sup>7</sup>&#8239;In time, he found all the pieces, and as&shy;sem&shy;bled the puz&shy;zle in&shy;to its beau&shy;ti&shy;ful, com&shy;plete form.
